    "text": "I. INTRODUCTION\nWe are proposing to require registrants to provide certain climate-related information in\ntheir registration statements and annual reports, including certain information about climate-\nrelated financial risks and climate-related financial metrics in their financial statements. The\ndisclosure of this information would provide consistent, comparable, and reliable\u2014and therefore\ndecision-useful\u2014information to investors to enable them to make informed judgments about the\nimpact of climate-related risks on current and potential investments.\nThe Commission has broad authority to promulgate disclosure requirements that are\n\u201cnecessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.\u201d3 We have\nconsidered this statutory standard and determined that disclosure of information about climate-\nrelated risks and metrics would be in the public interest and would protect investors. In making\nthis determination, we have also considered whether the proposed disclosures \u201cwill promote\nefficiency, competition, and capital formation.\u201d4\nWe are proposing to require disclosures about climate-related risks and metrics reflecting\nthose risks because this information can have an impact on public companies\u2019 financial\nperformance or position and may be material to investors in making investment or voting\ndecisions. For this reason, many investors\u2014including shareholders, investment advisers, and\ninvestment management companies\u2014currently seek information about climate-related risks from\ncompanies to inform their investment decision-making. Furthermore, many companies have\n3 See, e.g., Section 7 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. 77g] and Sections 12, 13, and 15 of the Exchange Act [15\nU.S.C. 78l, 78m, and 78o].\n4 See, e.g., Section 2(b) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. 77b(b)] and Section 3(f) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C.\n78c(f)].\n7\n\nbegun to provide some of this information in response to investor demand and in recognition of\nthe potential financial effects of climate-related risks on their businesses.\nWe are concerned that the existing disclosures of climate-related risks do not adequately\nprotect investors. For this reason, we believe that additional disclosure requirements may be\nnecessary or appropriate to elicit climate-related disclosures and to improve the consistency,\ncomparability, and reliability of climate-related disclosures. With respect to their existing\nclimate-related disclosures (to the extent registrants are already disclosing such information),\nregistrants often provide information outside of Commission filings and provide different\ninformation, in varying degrees of completeness, and in different documents and formats\u2014\nmeaning that the same information may not be available to investors across different companies.\nThis could result in increased costs to investors in obtaining useful climate-related information\nand impair the ability to make investment or voting decisions in line with investors\u2019 risk\npreferences. Also, companies may not disclose certain information needed to understand their\nexisting climate-related disclosures, such as the methodologies, data sources, assumptions, and\nother key parameters used to assess climate-related risks. To the extent companies primarily\nprovide this information separate from their financial reporting, it may be difficult for investors\nto determine whether a company\u2019s financial disclosures are consistent with its climate-related\ndisclosures.5 In addition, the information provided outside of Commission filings is not subject\nto the full range of liability and other investor protections that help elicit complete and accurate\ndisclosure by public companies.\n5 S&P Global, Seven ESG Trends to Watch in 2021 (Feb. 7, 2021), available at\nhttps://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/featured/seven-esg-trends-to-watch-in-2021. This study found\nthat approximately 90% of S&P 500 companies publish sustainability reports but only 16% include any\nreference to ESG factors in their Commission filings.\n8\n\nInvestors need information about climate-related risks\u2014and it is squarely within the\nCommission\u2019s authority to require such disclosure in the public interest and for the protection of\ninvestors\u2014because climate-related risks have present financial consequences that investors in\npublic companies consider in making investment and voting decisions.6 Investors have noted\nthat climate-related inputs have many uses in the capital allocation decision-making process\nincluding, but not limited to, insight into governance and risks management practices,7\nintegration into various valuation models, and credit research and assessments.8 Further, we\nunderstand investors often employ diversified strategies, and therefore do not necessarily\nconsider risk and return of a particular security in isolation but also in terms of the security\u2019s\neffect on the portfolio as a whole, which requires comparable data across registrants.9\nWhile climate-related risks implicate broader concerns\u2014and are subject to various other\nregulatory schemes\u2014our objective is to advance the Commission\u2019s mission to protect investors,\n6 See Financial Stability Oversight Council (\u201cFSOC\u201d), Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk 2021 (Oct.\n2021) (\u201c2021 FSOC Report\u201d), available at https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/FSOC-Climate-\nReport.pdf (detailing the myriad ways that climate-related risks pose financial threats both at the firm level and\nfinancial system level).

In particular, the impact of climate-related risks on both\nindividual businesses and the financial system as a whole are well documented.10 For example,\nthe Financial Stability Oversight Council\u2019s (\u201cFSOC\u2019s\u201d) Report on Climate-Related Financial\nRisk 2021 found that businesses, financial institutions, investors, and households may experience\ndirect financial effects from climate-related risks, and observed that the costs would likely be\nbroadly felt as they are passed through supply chains and to customers and as they reduce firms\u2019\nability to service debt or produce returns for investors.11 As a result, these climate-related risks\nand their financial impact could negatively affect the economy as a whole and create systemic\n10 In 2020 alone, a record 22 separate climate-related disasters with at least $1 billion in damages struck across the\nUnited States, surpassing the previous annual highs of 16 such events set in 2011 and 2017.

Investors would be able\nto use this information to make investment or voting decisions in line with their risk preferences.\nCapital allocation would become more efficient as investors are better able to price climate-\nrelated risks. In addition, more transparency and comparability in climate-related disclosures\nwould foster competition. Many other jurisdictions and financial regulators around the globe\nhave taken action or reached similar conclusions regarding the importance of climate-related\ndisclosures and are also moving towards the adoption of climate-related disclosure standards.20\nThis proposal builds on the Commission\u2019s previous rules and guidance on climate-related\ndisclosures, which date back to the 1970s. In 2010, in response to increasing calls by the public\nand shareholders for public companies to disclose information regarding how climate change\nmay affect their business and operations, the Commission published guidance (\u201c2010 Guidance\u201d)\nfor registrants on how the Commission\u2019s existing disclosure rules may require disclosure of the\nimpacts of climate change on a registrant\u2019s business or financial condition.21 Since that time, as\nclimate-related impacts have increasingly been well-documented and awareness of climate-\n19 See, e.g., OCC announcement: Risk Management: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management\nfor Large Banks; Request for Feedback | OCC (treas.gov), available at https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-\nissuances/bulletins/2021/bulletin-2021-62.html; and Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management\nfor Large Banks (treas.gov) (Dec. 16, 2021), available at https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-\nissuances/bulletins/2021/bulletin-2021-62a.pdf.\n20 See infra Section I.C.2.\n21 See Commission Guidance Regarding Disclosure Related to Climate Change, Release No. 33-9106 (Feb. 2,\n2010) [75 FR 6290 (Feb. 8, 2010)].

In addition, we have carefully considered how to craft this proposal\nto best advance investor protection and the public interest, consistent with the Commission\u2019s\ndisclosure authority and regulatory mission, and we welcome comments on how we can further\nachieve that goal.\nA. Background\nThe Commission first addressed the disclosure of material environmental issues in the\nearly 1970s when it issued an interpretive release stating that registrants should consider\ndisclosing in their SEC filings the financial impact of compliance with environmental laws.29\nThroughout the 1970s, the Commission continued to explore the need for specific rules\nmandating disclosure of information relating to litigation and other business costs arising out of\n25 See infra Section II.M.\n26 See Section II.G.3.\n27 See id.\n28 See Securities Act Section 27A [15 U.S.C. 77z-2] and Exchange Act Section 21E [15 U.S.C. 78u-5]. We\ndiscuss the application of the existing forward-looking statement safe harbors to the proposed climate-related\ndisclosures primarily in Sections II.C.3-4, II.E, II.G.1, and II.I.\n29 See Release No. 33-5170 (July 19, 1971) [36 FR 13989]. The Commission codified this interpretive position in\nits disclosure forms two years later. See Release 33-5386 (Apr. 20, 1973) [38 FR 12100] (\u201c1972\nAmendments\u201d).\n15\n\ncompliance with federal, state, and local laws that regulate the discharge of materials into the\nenvironment or otherwise relate to the protection of the environment. These topics were the\nsubject of several rulemaking efforts, extensive litigation, and public hearings, all of which\nresulted in the rules that now specifically address disclosure of environmental issues.30\nAfter almost a decade of consideration, the Commission adopted rules in 1982 mandating\ndisclosure of information relating to litigation and other business costs arising out of compliance\nwith federal, state, and local laws that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment or\notherwise relate to the protection of the environment.31 In addition to these specific disclosure\nrequirements, the Commission\u2019s other disclosure rules requiring, for example, information about\nmaterial risks and a description of the registrant\u2019s business, could give rise to an obligation to\nprovide disclosure related to the effects of climate change.32\n30 See Interpretive Release No. 33-6130 (Sept. 27, 1979) [44 FR 56924], which includes a brief summary of the\nNational Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the legal and administrative actions taken with regard to the\nCommission\u2019s environmental disclosure during the 1970s. See also NRDC v. SEC, 606 F.2d 1031, 1036-42\n(DC Cir. 1979) (discussing this history). More information relating to the Commission's efforts in this area is\nchronicled in Release No. 33-6315 (May 4, 1981) [46 FR 25638].\n31 See Release No. 33-6383 (Mar. 3, 1982) [47 FR 11380] (\u201c1982 Release\u201d) (adopting 17 CFR 229.103, which\nrequires a registrant to describe its material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation\nincidental to the business, and indicating that administrative or judicial proceedings arising under federal, state,\nor local law regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or primarily for the purpose of protecting\nthe environment, shall not be deemed \u201cordinary routine litigation incidental to the business\u201d and must be\ndescribed if meeting certain conditions). The 1982 Release also moved the information called for by the 1973\nAmendments to 17 CFR 229.101(c)(1)(xii), which, as part of a registrant\u2019s business description, required the\ndisclosure of the material effects that compliance with Federal, State and local provisions regulating the\ndischarge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, have had\nupon the registrant\u2019s capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position, as well as the disclosure of its\nmaterial estimated capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. In 2020, the Commission amended\n17 CFR 229.101(c)(1) to require, to the extent material to an understanding of the business taken as a whole,\ndisclosure of the material effects that compliance with government regulations, including environmental\nregulations, may have upon the capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive position of the registrant and its\nsubsidiaries. See Modernization of Regulation S-K Items 101, 103, and 105, Release No. 33-10825 (Aug. 26,\n2020) [85 FR 63726 (Oct. 8, 2020)] (\u201c2020 Release\u201d).\n32 See Release No. 33-9106, Section III.\n16\n\nIn its 2010 Guidance, the Commission observed that, in response to investor demand for\nclimate-related information, many companies were voluntarily reporting climate-related\ninformation outside their filings with the Commission. The Commission emphasized that\n\u201cregistrants should be aware that some of the information they may be reporting pursuant to\nthese mechanisms also may be required to be disclosed in filings made with the Commission\npursuant to existing disclosure requirements.\u201d33 Specifically, the 2010 Guidance emphasized\nthat climate change disclosure might, depending on the circumstances, be required in a\ncompany\u2019s Description of Business, Risk Factors, Legal Proceedings, and Management\u2019s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\u201cMD&A\u201d).34 The\n2010 Guidance further identified certain climate-related issues that companies may need to\nconsider in making their disclosures, including the direct and indirect impact of climate-related\nlegislation or regulations, international agreements, indirect consequences of business trends\nincluding changing demand for goods, and the physical impacts of climate change.\nThe proposals set forth in this release would augment and supplement the disclosures\nalready required in SEC filings. Accordingly, registrants should continue to evaluate the\nclimate-related risks they face and assess whether disclosures related to those climate-related\nrisks must be disclosed in their Description of Business, Risk Factors, Legal Proceedings, and\nMD&A as described in the 2010 Guidance. These disclosures should be based on the\nregistrant\u2019s specific facts and circumstances. While climate risks impact many issuers across\nindustries, the impacts of those risks on a particular registrant and how the registrant addresses\n33 See Release No. 33-9106, Section I.\n34 The 2010 Guidance also applies to corresponding disclosure requirements in Form 20-F by foreign private\nissuers.\n17"

The March 2021 Request for Public Input\nOn March 15, 2021, Acting Chair Allison Herren Lee requested public input on climate\ndisclosure from investors, registrants, and other market participants.36 The Acting Chair\nsolicited input on several issues, including how the Commission could best regulate disclosure\nconcerning climate change in order to provide more consistent, comparable, and reliable\ninformation for investors, whether the Commission should require the disclosure of certain\nmetrics and other climate-related information, the role that existing third-party climate-related\ndisclosure frameworks should play in the Commission\u2019s regulation of such disclosure, and\nwhether and how such disclosure should be subject to assurance.\nThe Commission received approximately 600 unique letters and over 5800 form letters in\nresponse to the Acting Chair\u2019s request for public input.37 We received letters from academics,\naccounting and audit firms, individuals, industry groups, investor groups, registrants, non-\ngovernmental organizations, professional climate advisors, law firms, professional investment\n35 Our recent amendments to Item 105 of Regulation S-K discourage the presentation of generic risks that could\napply generally to any registrant or offering. The fact that climate risks are broad-based does not, in our view,\ncause them to be generic. For example, thousands of companies in Houston were impacted by Hurricane\nHarvey. However, (1) their flood risk varied and some companies may have been far more impacted than\nothers (and would be more vulnerable to future catastrophic storms); (2) their operations were different and\nsome may have been more disrupted as a result than others\u2014e.g., a services business on the 10th floor of a\nbuilding may have experienced just a few days of disruption while an oil refinery may have been shut down for\nweeks; and (3) their risk management processes may have been different\u2014two similarly situated companies\nmay have different continuity of operations plans or may have taken steps to mitigate those types of risks. In\nsum, while the source of the risk may be common to many companies, the impact is not.\n36 See Acting Chair Allison Herren Lee Public Statement, Public Input Welcomed on Climate Change Disclosures.\n37 The comment letters are available at https://www.sec.gov/comments/climate-disclosure/cll12.htm.

A\nnumber of commenters39 stated that mandated disclosures are necessary because climate change\nposes significant financial risks to registrants and their investors.40 According to one of the\ncommenters, 68 out of 77 industries are likely to be significantly affected by climate risk.41\nMany commenters criticized the current disclosure practice, in which some issuers voluntarily\nprovide climate disclosures based on a variety of different third-party frameworks, because it has\n38 See, e.g., letters from BlackRock (June 11, 2021) ($9T); Ceres (June 10, 2021) (representing Investor Network\non Climate Risk and Sustainability) ($37T); Council of Institutional Investors (June 11, 2021) ($4T);\nInvestment Adviser Association (June 11, 2021) ($25T); Investment Company Institute (June 4, 2021)\n($30.8T); PIMCO (June 9, 2021) ($2T); SIFMA (June 10, 2021) ($45T); State Street Global Advisors (June 14,\n2021) (3.9T); and Vanguard Group, Inc.

These commenters stated their belief that the assumptions\nunderlying the assessment of the impact of climate change were too uncertain to permit\ncompanies to ascertain the real risks to their operations and financial condition caused by climate\nchange.43 These commenters stated that they opposed implementation of climate-related\ndisclosure rules, and argued that such rules would exceed the Commission\u2019s statutory authority.\nSome of these commenters also argued that such rules are not necessary because registrants are\nalready required to disclose material climate risks, or that such rules would be more costly than\nthe current \u201cprivate ordering\u201d of climate disclosures.44 Some commenters also argued that\nmandated climate disclosure rules could violate First Amendment rights.45\n42 See, e.g., letters from Amalgamated Bank; Bank of Finland (June 1, 2021); Blueprint Financial (June 11, 2021);\nCanadian Coalition of Good Governance (June 9, 2021); Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (June 12,\n2021); Clean Yield Asset Management (June 11, 2021); Coalition for Inclusive Capitalism (June 14, 2021);\nFelician Sisters of North America; First Affirmative Financial Network (June 2, 2021); William and Flora\nHewitt Foundation (June 9, 2021); Impact Investors, Inc.

As part of its filing review process, the\nCommission staff also assessed the extent to which registrants currently disclose climate-related\nrisks in their Commission filings. Since 2010, disclosures related to climate change have\ngenerally increased, but there is considerable variation in the content, detail, and location (i.e., in\nreports filed with the Commission, in sustainability reports posted on registrant websites, or\nelsewhere) of climate-related disclosures. The staff has observed significant inconsistency in the\ndepth and specificity of disclosures by registrants across industries and within the same industry.\nThe staff has found significantly more extensive information in registrants\u2019 sustainability reports\nand other locations such as their websites as compared with their reports filed with the\nCommission. In addition, the disclosures in registrants\u2019 Forms 10-K frequently contain general,\nboilerplate discussions that provide limited information as to the registrants\u2019 assessment of their\nclimate-related risks or their impact on the companies\u2019 business.46\nWe are also mindful of the benefits to investors of requiring climate-related information\nin SEC filings. Providing more extensive climate-related disclosure in sustainability reports,\nwhile excluding such relevant information from Forms 10-K, may make it difficult for investors\nto analyze and compare how climate-related risks and impacts affect registrants\u2019 businesses and\nconsolidated financial statements. The inclusion of climate-related disclosures in SEC filings\nshould increase the consistency, comparability, and reliability of climate-related information for\ninvestors. The placement of climate-related information in different locations can make it\ndifficult for investors to find comparable climate-related disclosures, whereas inclusion in a\n46 The staff of the Division of Corporation Finance has developed a sample comment letter for registrants to elicit\nimproved disclosure on some of the deficient areas noted in their review of filings. See Climate Change\nDisclosure-Sample Letter, available at https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/sample-letter-climate-change-disclosures.\n21\n\nregistrant\u2019s Form 10-K or registration statement should make it easier for investors to find and\ncompare this information.47 Further, information that is filed with the Commission in Exchange\nAct periodic reports is subject to disclosure controls and procedures (\u201cDCP\u201d), which help to\nensure that a registrant maintains appropriate processes for collecting and communicating the\nnecessary information by which to formulate the climate-related disclosures.48 Moreover,\ninformation filed as part of a registrant\u2019s Form 10-K carries certain additional potential liability,\nwhich itself can cause registrants to prepare and review information filed in the Form 10-K more\ncarefully than information presented outside SEC filings.49\nHaving considered the public feedback and the staff\u2019s experience with climate-related\ndisclosures, we believe that the current disclosure system is not eliciting consistent, comparable,\nand reliable information that enables investors both to assess accurately the potential impacts of\nclimate-related risks on the nature of a registrant\u2019s business and to gauge how a registrant\u2019s\nboard and management are assessing and addressing those impacts.50 The Commission has\nbroad authority to promulgate disclosure rules that are in the public interest or for the protection\n47 See, e.g., letter from Pricewaterhouse Coopers.\n48 See 17 CFR 240.13a-15 and 17 CFR 240.15d-15.\n49 We note that the liability provisions of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act can apply to\nstatements made in filings with the SEC or elsewhere, such as in sustainability reports or on company websites.\nSee, e.g., SEC v. Stinson, No. 10-3130, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 65723, 2011 WL 2462038, at 12 (E.D. Pa. June\n20, 2011) (finding defendants liable under Section 10(b) when they communicated material misstatements and\nomissions in direct solicitations via e-mail, a webinar, and various web sites). As such, registrants should\nscrutinize and ensure the accuracy of such statements whether or not filed with the Commission. In addition,\ninformation filed in a Form 10-K is subject to Section 18 of the Exchange Act. Further, information filed in an\nannual report on Form 10-K (and other current and periodic reports) can be incorporated by reference in certain\nSecurities Act registration statements, such as those filed on Form S-3, and thereby become subject to the\nliability provisions of the Securities Act. See Securities Act Section 11 (15 U.S.C. 77k) and Section 12 (15\nU.S.C. 77l). See infra Section II.C.3-4, II.E, II.G.1, and II.I regarding the application to forward-looking\nclimate disclosures of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements that was added to the Securities Act and\nExchange Act pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\n50 See supra note 42 and accompanying text.\n22\n\nof investors and that promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation.51 In light of the\npresent and growing significance of climate-related risks to registrants and the inadequacies of\ncurrent climate disclosures, we are proposing to revise our rules to include climate-related\ndisclosure items and metrics to elicit investment decision-useful information that is necessary or\nappropriate to protect investors.\nWe also believe that enhanced climate disclosure requirements could increase confidence\nin the capital markets and help promote efficient valuation of securities and capital formation by\nrequiring more consistent, comparable, and reliable disclosure about climate-related risks,\nincluding how those risks are likely to impact a registrant\u2019s business operations and financial\nperformance.52 The proposed requirements may also result in benefits to registrants, given\nexisting costs to registrants that have resulted from the inconsistent market response to investor\ndemand for climate-related information.53 In this regard our proposal would provide registrants\nwith a more standardized framework to communicate their assessments of climate-related risks\n51 See letters from Jill E. Fisch and 18 other law professor signatories (June 11, 2021) (referencing Sections 7, 10,\nand 19(a) of the Securities Act; and Sections 3(b), 12, 13, 14, 15(d), and 23(a) of the Exchange Act); and\nNatural Resources Defense Council (June 11, 2021).\n52 See letters from Eni SpA (June 12, 2021); Jill.

The Growing Investor Demand for Climate-Related Risk Disclosure and\nRelated Information\n1. Major Investor Climate-Related Initiatives\nAs the Commission recognized in 2010 and earlier, there has been significant investor\ndemand for information about how climate conditions may impact their investments. That\ndemand has been increasing in recent years. Several major institutional investors, which\ncollectively have trillions of dollars in investments under management, have demanded climate-\nrelated information from the companies in which they invest because of their assessment of\nclimate change as a risk to their portfolios, and to investments generally, and also to satisfy\ninvestor interest in investments that are considered \u201csustainable.\u201d As a result, these investors\nhave sought to include and consider climate risk as part of their investment selection process.55\nThese institutional investors have formed investor initiatives to collectively urge companies to\nprovide better information about the impact that climate change has had or is likely to have on\n54 Providing a more standardized framework for climate-related disclosures would be consistent with the\nRecommendation from the Investor-as-Owner Subcommittee of the SEC Investor Advisory Committee Relating\nto ESG Disclosure (May 14, 2020) (\u201cIAC Recommendation\u201d), available at\nhttps://www.sec.gov/spotlight/investor-advisory-committee-2012/recommendation-of-the-investor-as-owner-\nsubcommittee-on-esg-disclosure.pdf. The term \u201cESG\u201d refers to environmental, social, and governance matters,\nof which climate-related disclosures is a part. The IAC Recommendation focused on the inadequacies of ESG\ndisclosures broadly, and not just on those involving climate. The IAC Recommendation stated that, to the\nextent that SEC reporting obligations would require a single standard of material, decision-useful ESG\ninformation, as relevant to each issuer, and based upon data that issuers already use to make their business\ndecisions, such an approach would level the playing field between well-financed large issuers and capital\nconstrained small issuers.\n55 See supra note 23.\n24\n\ntheir businesses, and to urge governments and companies to take steps to reduce investors\u2019\nexposure to climate risks. Among these initiatives:56\n\u2022 In 2019, more than 630 investors collectively managing more than $37 trillion signed the\nGlobal Investor Statement to Governments on Climate Change urging governments to\nrequire climate-related financial reporting;57\n\u2022 This investor initiative continued as the Investor Agenda\u2019s 2021 Global Investor\nStatement to Governments on the Climate Crisis, which was signed by 733 global\ninstitutional investors, including some of the largest investors, with more than US $52\ntrillion in assets under management in the aggregate. This Statement called for\ngovernments to implement a number of measures, including mandating climate risk\ndisclosure.58\n\u2022 The UN Principles for Responsible Investment (\u201cPRI\u201d)59 has acquired over 4,000\nsignatories who, as of July 13, 2021, have, in the aggregate, assets under management\nexceeding $120 trillion as of July 13, 2021;60\n56 There is some overlap in the signatories to the listed initiatives.\n57 See United Nations Climate Change, 631 Institutional Investors Managing More than USD 37 Trillion in Assets\nUrge Governments to Step up Climate Ambition (Dec. 9, 2019), available at https://unfccc.int/news/631-\ninstitutional-investors-managing-more-than-usd-37-trillion-in-assets-urge-governments-to-step-up.\n58 See The Investor Agenda, 2021 Global Investor Statement to Governments on the Climate Crisis (Oct. 27,\n2021), available at https://theinvestoragenda.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Global-Investor-Statement-\nto-Governments-on-the-Climate-Crisis.pdf.\n59 PRI was created by a UN-sponsored small group of large global investors in 2006. A stated core goal of the\nPRI is to help investors protect their portfolios from climate-related risks and to take advantage of climate-\nrelated opportunities associated with a shift to a low-carbon global economy.

Each of these initiatives has advocated for\nmandatory climate risk disclosure requirements aligned with the recommendations of the Task\nForce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (\u201cTCFD\u201d)64 so that disclosures are consistent,\ncomparable, and reliable. The investor signatories of Climate Action 100+ emphasized that\nobtaining better disclosure of climate-related risks and companies\u2019 strategies to address their\n61 See Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, Net Zero Asset Managers initiative announces 41 new signatories, with\nsector seeing \u2018net zero tipping point\u2019 (July 6, 2021), available at https://www.netzeroassetmanagers.org/net-\nzero-asset-managers-initiative-announces-41-new-signatories-with-sector-seeing-net-zero-tipping-point.\n62 See Climate Action 100+, About Climate Action 100+, available at https://www.climateaction100.org/about/\n(indicating that the initiative is engaging companies on strengthening climate-related financial disclosures).\n63 See GFANZ, About Us, available at https://www.gfanzero.com/about/. Another organization, the CDP,\nprovides a means for investors to request that companies provide climate-related disclosures through the CDP.\nIn 2021, over 590 investors with $110 trillion in assets under management requested that thousands of\ncompanies disclose climate related information to them through the CDP. See CDP, Request Environmental\nInformation, available at https://www.cdp.net/en/investor/request-environmental-\ninformation#d52d69887a88f63e15931b5db2cbe80d.\n64 We discuss the TCFD in greater detail in Section I.D.1 below.\n26\n\nexposure to those risks is consistent with the exercise of their fiduciary duties to their respective\nclients.65\nAt the same time, many companies have made commitments with respect to climate\nchange, such as commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or become \u201cnet zero\u201d by a\nparticular date.66 Companies may make these commitments to attract investors, to appeal to\ncustomers that prioritize sustainability, or to reduce their exposure to risks posed by an expected\ntransition to a lower carbon economy.67 In response to these commitments, investors have\ndemanded more detailed information about climate-related targets and companies\u2019 plans to\nachieve them in order to assess the credibility of those commitments and compare companies\nbased on those commitments.68\nThese initiatives demonstrate that investors are using information about climate risks now\nas part of their investment selection process and are seeking more informative disclosures about\nthose risks. As an increasing number of investors incorporate this information, in particular\n65 See Climate Action 100+, About Climate Action 100+. Further, commenters noted their fiduciary obligations to\nconsider climate-related risks. See, e.g., letters from PRI (Consultation Response); and California Public\nEmployee Retirement System (CalPERS) (June 12, 2021).\n66 According to one publication, two-thirds of S&P 500 companies had set a carbon reduction target by the end of\n2020.

Third-Party Data, Voluntary Disclosure Frameworks, and International\nDisclosure Initiatives\nDespite increasing investor demand for information about climate-related risks and\nstrategies, many investors maintain that they cannot obtain the consistent, comparable, and\nmaterial information that they need to properly inform their investment or voting decisions.69 In\n2020, the Commission\u2019s Investor Advisory Committee (\u201cIAC\u201d) noted the fragmentation of\ninformation that has resulted from a rise in third-party data providers that have emerged to try to\nmeet the informational demands of investors.70 The IAC recommended that the Commission\ntake action to ensure investors have the material, comparable, consistent information about\nclimate and other ESG matters that they need to make investment and voting decisions.\nIn addition, a diverse group of third parties has developed climate-related reporting\nframeworks seeking to meet investors\u2019 informational demands. These include the Global\n69 See supra note 42.\n70 See IAC Recommendation. The IAC Recommendation noted that more than 125 third-party ESG data\nproviders, including ESG ratings firms, have emerged to try to meet the informational demands of investors.\nAccording to the IAC Recommendation, these data providers are limited in their ability collectively to provide\ninvestors with comparable and consistent information as they use different information sources and different\u2014\nfrequently opaque\u2014methodologies to conduct their analyses, which compromises the usefulness and reliability\nof the information. This current heterogeneity in practices and disparate demands from investors and ratings\nfirms places a significant burden on companies asked to provide this information in a variety of formats. The\nIAC Recommendation further observed that many companies feel compelled to respond to the multiple surveys\nof ESG rating firms because ignoring them or refusing to respond can lead to a low rating, which can adversely\naffect stock price and access to capital. While the proposed rules would not necessarily eliminate third-party\nquestionnaires, they would help to provide standardized information to all investors and might reduce the need\nto obtain the information obtained through questionnaires.\n28\n\nReporting Initiative (\u201cGRI\u201d),71 CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project),72 Climate\nDisclosure Standards Board (\u201cCDSB\u201d),73 Value Reporting Foundation (formed through a merger\nof the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (\u201cSASB\u201d) and the International Integrated\nReporting Council (\u201cIIRC\u201d)),74 and the TCFD.75\nTo some extent, the development of these disparate frameworks has led to an increase in\nthe number of companies that are providing some climate-related disclosures.76 However,\nbecause they are voluntary, companies that choose to disclose under these frameworks may\nprovide partial disclosures or they may choose not to participate every year. In addition, the\nform and content of the disclosures may vary significantly from company to company, or from\nperiod to period for the same company. The situation resulting from these multiple voluntary\nframeworks has failed to produce the consistent, comparable, and reliable information that\ninvestors need.77 Instead, the proliferation of third-party reporting frameworks has contributed to\nreporting fragmentation, which can hinder investors\u2019 ability to understand and compare\nregistrants\u2019 climate-related disclosures.

See letter from CDP. The TCFD has similarly reported growth in the number of companies\nand countries supporting its climate-related disclosure recommendations. See TCFD, 2021 Status Report (Oct.\n2021), available at https://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/60/2021/07/2021-TCFD-Status_Report.pdf (stating\nthat, as of Oct. 6, 2021, the TCFD had over 2,600 supporters globally, including 1,069 financial institutions\nresponsible for assets of US $194 trillion).\n77 See supra note 42.\n29\n\nfor Sustainable Development found that investors had difficulty using existing sustainability\ndisclosures because they lack consistency and comparability.78 In addition, a 2020 study by the\nYale Initiative on Sustainable Finance found that the proliferation of reporting frameworks may\nhave made reporting more difficult for issuers.79 Moreover, given the voluntary nature of these\nthird-party frameworks, there may not be sufficient incentives or external disciplines to ensure\nthat companies are providing complete and robust disclosure under those frameworks.80\nThe staff has reviewed more than a dozen studies of climate-related disclosures\nconducted by third parties, such as the CDP,81 KPMG,82 TCFD83, and Ernst & Young,84 which\nassessed the adherence of the climate-related disclosures to various third-party frameworks, such\nas the TCFD.

Other analyses of current climate reporting have found a lack of\ntransparency and standardization with regard to the methodologies companies apply in disclosing\nclimate-related information.86\nThe increased fragmentation of climate reporting resulting from the proliferation of third-\nparty reporting frameworks has motivated a number of recent international efforts to obtain more\nconsistent, comparable, and reliable climate-related information for investors. For example:\n\u2022 A consultation paper published by the IFRS Foundation87 Trustees in 2020 noted the\nbroad range of voluntary sustainability reporting frameworks that have increased\n85 For example, the TCFD report found that the average level of disclosure across the TCFD\u2019s 11 disclosure\ncategories was 40% for the energy sector, 30% for the materials and building sector, 18% for the consumer\ngoods sector and 13% for the technology sector. The level of disclosure varied among categories with only 4%\nor reporting companies disclosing the resilience of their strategies in North America and 50% reporting their\nrisks and opportunities (the category with the highest level of disclosure). The Ernst & Young report found\nmany companies in industries considered to have high exposure to climate-related risks lack high quality\nclimate disclosures. The Ernst & Young report graded the average quality of the disclosures at 27 out of 100.\n86 See, e.g., The SEC\u2019s Time to Act, Center for American Progress (Feb. 19, 2021) (\u201c[T]here is a lack of\nstandardization of the data, assumptions, and methodologies companies use to meet the standards, with much of\nthis information being opaque. Clearly, the current path of climate disclosure will not provide the transparency\nthat an increasing number of investors are seeking and, indeed, a properly functioning market requires\u2014\nconsistency of disclosures across time, comparability of disclosures across companies, and reliability of the\ninformation that is disclosed.\u201d) See, also, Andy Green and Andrew Schwartz, Corporate Long-Termism,\nTransparency, and the Public Interest (Oct. 2, 2018) (\u201c[C]orporate disclosure available today is insufficient, not\ncomparable, and unreliable\u201d); and Managing Climate Risk in the U.S. Financial System, Report of the Climate-\nRelated Market Risk Subcommittee, Market Risk Advisory Committee of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission (2020) (\u201cLarge companies are increasingly disclosing some climate-related information, but\nsignificant variations remain in the information disclosed by each company, making it difficult for investors and\nothers to understand exposure and manage climate risks.\u201d).\n87 The IFRS Foundation refers to the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation, which was\nestablished to develop a single set of \u201chigh-quality,\u201d enforceable, and globally accepted accounting standards.\nSee IFRS - Who we are, available at https://www.ifrs.org/about-us/who-we-are/.

    "text": "D. Development of a Climate-Related Reporting Framework\nIn recent years, two significant developments have occurred that support and inform the\nCommission\u2019s proposed climate-related reporting rules. The first involves the TCFD, which has\ndeveloped a climate-related reporting framework that has become widely accepted by both\nregistrants and investors.96 The second involves the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (\u201cGHG\nProtocol\u201d), which has become a leading accounting and reporting standard for greenhouse gas\nemissions.97 Both the TCFD and the GHG Protocol have developed concepts and a vocabulary\nthat are commonly used by companies when providing climate-related disclosures in their\nsustainability or related reports. As discussed in greater detail below, the Commission\u2019s\nproposed rules incorporate some of these concepts and vocabulary, which by now are familiar to\nmany registrants and investors.\n1. The Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure\nOur proposed climate-related disclosure framework is modeled in part on the TCFD\u2019s\nrecommendations. A goal of the proposed rules is to elicit climate-related disclosures that are\nconsistent, comparable, and reliable while also attempting to limit the compliance burden\nassociated with these disclosures. The TCFD framework has been widely accepted by issuers,\n96 A number of registrants recommended basing the Commission\u2019s climate-related disclosure rules on the TCFD\nframework. See, e.g., letters from Adobe; Alphabet Inc. et al.; BNP Paribas (June 11, 2021); bp; Chevron (June\n11, 2021; ConocoPhilips; and Walmart. Similarly, numerous investors and investor groups recommended the\nTCFD framework. See letters from Alberta Investment Management Corporation; BlackRock; CalPERS;\nCALSTRS (June 4, 2021); Impact Investors, Inc.; and San Francisco Employees Retirement System. See also\ninfra Section II.A.1 for further discussion of the many commenters that recommended basing the Commission\u2019s\nclimate-related disclosure rules on the TCFD framework.\n97 See, e.g., letter from Natural Resources Defense Council (stating that most companies providing climate-related\ninformation do so using the three-part (scope) framework developed by the GHG Protocol and noting other\norganizations, such as the CDP, that use the GHG Protocol\u2019s framework and methodology); see also GHG\nProtocol, Companies and Organizations, available at https://ghgprotocol.org/companies-and-organizations\n(stating that 92% of companies responding to the CDP in 2016 used the GHG Protocol\u2019s standards and\nguidance).\n34\n\ninvestors, and other market participants, and, accordingly, we believe that proposing rules based\non the TCFD framework may facilitate achieving this balance between eliciting better disclosure\nand limiting compliance costs.98\nIn April 2015, the Group of 20 Finance Ministers directed the Financial Stability Board\n(\u201cFSB\u201d) to evaluate ways in which the financial sector could address climate-related concerns.99\nThe FSB concluded that better information was needed to facilitate informed investment\ndecisions and to help investors and other market participants to better understand and take into\naccount climate-related risks. The FSB established the TCFD, an industry-led task force charged\nwith promoting better-informed investment, credit, and insurance underwriting decisions.100\nSince then, the framework for climate-related disclosures developed by the TCFD has been\nrefined and garnered global support as a reliable framework for climate-related financial\nreporting.101\nIn 2017, the TCFD published disclosure recommendations that provide a framework by\nwhich to evaluate material climate-related risks and opportunities through an assessment of their\nprojected short-, medium-, and long-term financial impacts on a registrant. The TCFD\nframework establishes eleven disclosure topics related to four core themes that provide a\n98 See infra Section II.A.1 and notes 145 through 149.\n99 See TCFD, 2020 Status Report (Oct. 2020). The Group of 20 (\u201cG20\u201d) is a group of finance ministers and\ncentral bank governors from 19 countries, including the United States, plus the European Union, which was\nformed in 1999 to promote global economic growth, international trade, and regulation of financial markets.\nAccording to the G20, its members represent more than 80% of world GDP, 75% of international trade, and\n60% of the world population. See G20, About the G20, available at https://g20.org/about-the-g20/.\n100 See TCFD, Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (June 2017),\navailable at https://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/60/2020/10/FINAL-2017-TCFD-Report-11052018.pdf.\n101 See, e.g., Climate Action 100+, The Three Asks, available at https://www.climateaction100.org/approach/the-\nthree-asks/ (requiring participating investors to ask the companies with which they engage to provide\nenhanced corporate disclosure in line with the TCFD\u2019s recommendations; and CDP, How CDP is aligned to the\nTCFD, available at https://www.cdp.net/en/guidance/how-cdp-is-aligned-to-the-tcfd (explaining how the CDP\nhas aligned its questionnaires to elicit disclosures aligned with the TCFD\u2019s recommendations).\n35\n\nstructure for the assessment, management, and disclosure of climate-related financial risks:\ngovernance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.102\nSupport for the TCFD\u2019s recommendations by companies and other reporting frameworks\nhas grown steadily since the TCFD\u2019s formation.103 As of October 2021 more than 2,600\norganizations globally, with a total market capitalization of $25 trillion have expressed support\nfor the TCFD.104 Further, 1,069 financial institutions, managing assets of $194 trillion, also\nsupport the TCFD.105 In recognition of the widespread adoption by companies of TCFD\nreporting, a number of countries, including the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Switzerland,\nand the European Union that have proposed mandatory climate-risk disclosure requirements\nhave indicated an intention to base disclosure requirements on the TCFD framework.106 Further,\nthe TCFD\u2019s recommendations have been adopted by, and incorporated into, other voluntary\nclimate disclosure frameworks such as the CDP, GRI, CDSB, and SASB frameworks. The\nTCFD also forms the framework for the Prototype that the IFRS Foundation provided to the\n102 See TCFD, TCFD_Booklet_FNL_Digital_March-2020.pdf (bbhub.io) (Mar. 2021), available at\nhttps://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/60/2020/10/TCFD_Booklet_FNL_Digital_March-2020.pdf.\n103 According to the TCFD, \u201c[for] companies, support is a commitment to work toward their own implementation\nof the TCFD recommendations.\u201d https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/support-tcfd/\n104 See TCFD, 2021 Status Report. A recent survey by Moody\u2019s of over 3,800 companies worldwide indicated that\nthe global average disclosure rate of companies that reported across all 11 TCFD\u2019s recommendations increased\nto 22% in 2021 from 16% in 2020.

In addition, according to a recent report by the Governance & Accountability\nInstitute, Inc., 70% of companies in the Russell 1000 Index published sustainability reports in 2020, and of\nthose reporters, 30% mentioned or aligned their disclosures with the TCFD framework, and 40% responded to\nthe CDP questionnaires, which are aligned with the TCFD.

The Greenhouse Gas Protocol\nQuantitative greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions data can enable investors to assess a\nregistrant\u2019s exposure to climate-related risks, including regulatory, technological, and market\nrisks driven by a transition to a lower-GHG intensive economy.109 This data also could help\ninvestors to assess the progress of registrants with public commitments to reduce GHG\nemissions, which would be important in assessing potential future capital outlays that might be\nrequired to meet such commitments. For these reasons, many investors and other commenters\nrecommended that we require disclosure of a registrant\u2019s GHG emissions.110 Many commenters\nalso recommended that we base any GHG emissions disclosure requirement on the GHG\n107 See Climate-related Disclosures Prototype, Developed by the Technical Readiness Working Group, chaired by\nthe IFRS Foundation, to provide recommendations to the International Sustainability Standards Board for\nconsideration (Nov. 2021).\n108 HM Treasury, G7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Communique \u2013 Policy Paper (June 2021),\navailable at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/g7-finance-ministers-meeting-june-2021-\ncommunique/g7-finance-ministers-and-central-bank-governors-communique (stating their support of mandatory\nclimate-related financial disclosures based on the TCFD framework because of investors\u2019 need for high quality,\nreliable, comparable climate-risk data).\n109 See, e.g., letters from Calvert Research and Management (June 1, 2021); Ceres et al (June 10, 2021); NY State\nComptroller (June 8, 2021); and SASB (May 19, 2021).\n110 See infra Section II.G.1 and note 412.\n37\n\nProtocol.111 These commenters indicated that the GHG Protocol has become the most widely-\nused global greenhouse gas accounting standard.112 For example, the Environmental Protection\nAgency (\u201cEPA\u201d) Center for Corporate Climate Leadership references the GHG Protocol\u2019s\nstandards and guidance as resources for companies that seek to calculate their GHG emissions.113\nThe GHG Protocol was created through a partnership between the World Resources\nInstitute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, which agreed in 1997 to\ncollaborate with businesses and NGOs to create a standardized GHG accounting methodology.114\nThe GHG Protocol has been updated periodically since its original publication and has been\nbroadly incorporated into sustainability reporting frameworks, including the TCFD, Value\nReporting Foundation, GRI, CDP, CDSB, and the IFRS Foundation\u2019s Prototype.\nThe GHG Protocol\u2019s Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard provides uniform\nmethods to measure and report the seven greenhouse gasses covered by the Kyoto Protocol \u2013\ncarbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, sulfur\n111 See, e.g., letters from Apple, Inc.

These might include emissions from company-owned or controlled machinery or\nvehicles, or methane emissions from petroleum operations. Scope 2 emissions are those\nemissions primarily resulting from the generation of electricity purchased and consumed by the\ncompany.117 Because these emissions derive from the activities of another party (the power\nprovider), they are considered indirect emissions. Scope 3 emissions are all other indirect\nemissions not accounted for in Scope 2 emissions. These emissions are a consequence of the\ncompany\u2019s activities but are generated from sources that are neither owned nor controlled by the\ncompany.118 These might include emissions associated with the production and transportation of\n115 See id.

Proposed TCFD-Based Disclosure Framework\nWe have modeled the proposed disclosure rules in part on the TCFD disclosure\nframework. Building on the TCFD framework should enable companies to leverage the\nframework with which many investors and issuers are already familiar, which should help to\nmitigate both the compliance burden for issuers and any burdens faced by investors in analyzing\nand comparing the new proposed disclosures.\nMany commenters that supported climate disclosure rules recommended that we consider\nthe TCFD framework in developing those rules. Numerous commenters stated that the\nCommission should base its climate-related disclosure rules on the TCFD framework either as a\n144 See infra Section II.M.\n46\n\nstandalone framework,145 or in conjunction with industry-specific metrics drawn from the\nSASB146 or other third-party frameworks.147 A broad range of commenters, including both\n145 See, e.g., letters from Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Autodesk, Inc., eBay Inc., Facebook, Inc., Intel\nCorporation, and Salesforce.com, Inc.

First,\ncommenters indicated that, because of the widespread adoption of the framework, issuers and\ninvestors have experience making and using TCFD disclosures. As a result, according to\ncommenters, aligning SEC rules with the TCFD could reduce the burden on issuers and increase\nthe consistency and comparability of climate disclosures.150 Second, commenters stated that the\ninformation that the TCFD disclosures elicit is useful for investors to understand companies\u2019\nexposure to and management of climate-related risks.151 Third, various jurisdictions around the\nworld have announced their intention to align their domestic disclosure rules with the TCFD.152\nCommenters stated that by aligning with the TCFD framework, the Commission could\npotentially facilitate higher levels of consistency and comparability of disclosures globally.153\nThe consistency and breadth of these comments comport with our understanding that the\nTCFD framework has been widely accepted by issuers, investors, and other market participants\nand reinforce our view that the framework would provide an appropriate foundation for the\n148 See, e.g., letters from Adobe; Alphabet Inc. et al.; BNP Paribas; bp; Chevron; ConocoPhilips; and Walmart.\n149 See, e.g., letters from Alberta Investment Management Corporation; BlackRock; CalPERS; CALSTRS; Impact\nInvestors, Inc.; and San Francisco Employees Retirement System.\n150 See, e.g., letters from BNP Paribas; Deutsche Bank (June 11, 2021); and Institute of International Bankers.\n151 See, e.g., letters from AllianceBernstein; CALSTRS; Investment Company Institute; and NY State Comptroller.\n152 See supra note 95 and accompanying text.\n153 See, e.g., letters from BNP Paribas; bp; and Chevron.\n48\n\nproposed amendments.154 Basing the Commission\u2019s climate-related disclosure rules on a\nglobally recognized framework should help elicit climate-related disclosures that are consistent,\ncomparable, and reliable while also limiting the compliance burden for registrants that are\nalready providing climate-related disclosures based on this framework.\nSimilar to the TCFD framework, the proposed climate-related provisions under\nRegulation S-K would require disclosure of a registrant\u2019s: governance of climate-related risks;155\nany material climate-related impacts on its strategy, business model, and outlook;156 climate-\nrelated risk management;157 GHG emissions metrics;158 and climate-related targets and goals, if\nany.159\nThe proposed climate-related provisions under Regulation S-X would require a registrant\nto disclose in a note to its financial statements certain disaggregated climate-related financial\nstatement metrics that are mainly derived from existing financial statement line items.160 The\nproposed rules would require disclosure falling under the following three categories of\n154 Proponents of the TCFD framework include academics (see, e.g., letters from Jill Fisch et al., J. Robert Gibson\n(May 26, 2021), and Gina-Gail S Fletcher (June 14, 2021)); accounting and audit firms (see, e.g., letters from\nAICPA (June 11, 2021), Center for Audit Quality (\u201cCAQ\u201d) (June 11, 2021), and KPMG LLP (June 12, 2021));\nforeign firms (see, e.g., letters from Bank of Finland, BNP Paribas, bp, and Deutsche Bank); industry groups\n(see, e.g., letters from American Chemistry Council, Association of American Railroads (June 11, 2021), and\nInformation Technology Industry Council (June 11, 2021)); investor groups (see, e.g., letters from CalPERS;\nCALSTRS; and San Francisco Employees Retirement System); individuals (see, e.g., letters from Emmanuelle\nHaack, Christopher Lish, and Maria Stoica); issuers (see, e.g., letters from Adobe, Alphabet Inc. et al., Apple,\nand Chevron); NGOs (see, e.g., letters from Ceres et al., Climate Governance Initiative, Natural Resources\nDefense Council, and UNEP); professional climate advisors (see, e.g., letters from Catavento Consultancy,\nDouglas Hileman Consulting, ERM CVS, and Ethic Inc.); and professional investment advisors/investment\nmanagement companies (see, e.g., letters from AllianceBernstein, Impact Investors, Miller/Howard\nInvestments, and Neuberger Berman).\n155 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1501.\n156 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1502.\n157 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1503.\n158 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504.\n159 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1506.\n160 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-01 and 14-02.\n49"

In this way, such a discussion will serve a similar function to the\nMD&A but will focus on climate-related risk specifically.

Should we add a new subpart to Regulation S-K and a new article to Regulation S-X that\nwould require a registrant to disclose certain climate-related information, as proposed? Would\nincluding the climate-related disclosure in Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X facilitate the\npresentation of climate information as part of a registrant\u2019s regular business reporting? Should\nwe instead place the climate-related disclosure requirements in a new regulation or report? Are\nthere certain proposed provisions, such as GHG emissions disclosure requirements, that would\nbe more appropriate under Regulation S-X than Regulation S-K?\n2. If adopted, how will investors utilize the disclosures contemplated in this release to assess\nclimate-related risks? How will investors use the information to assess the physical effects and\nrelated financial impacts from climate-related events? How will investors use the information to\nassess risks associated with a transition to a lower carbon economy?\n3. Should we model the Commission\u2019s climate-related disclosure framework in part on the\nframework recommended by the TCFD, as proposed? Would alignment with the TCFD help\nelicit climate-related disclosures that are consistent, comparable, and reliable for investors?\nWould alignment with the TCFD framework help mitigate the reporting burden for issuers and\nfacilitate understanding of climate-related information by investors because the framework is\nwidely used by companies in the United States and around the world? Are there aspects of the\nTCFD framework that we should not adopt? Should we instead adopt rules that are based on a\n53\n\ndifferent third-party framework? If so, which framework? Should we base the rules on\nsomething other than an existing third-party framework?\n4. Do our current reporting requirements yield adequate and sufficient information regarding\nclimate-related risks to allow investors to make informed decisions? In lieu of, or in addition to\nthe proposed amendments, should we provide updated guidance on how our existing rules may\nelicit better disclosure about climate-related risks?\n5. Should we require a registrant to present the climate-related disclosure in an appropriately\ncaptioned, separate part of the registration statement or annual report, as proposed? Should this\ndisclosure instead be presented as part of the registrant\u2019s MD&A?\n6. Should we permit a registrant to incorporate by reference some of the climate-related\ndisclosure from other parts of the registration statement or annual report, as proposed? Should\nwe permit a registrant to incorporate by reference climate-related disclosure that appears in a\nsustainability report if the registrant includes the incorporated by referenced disclosure as an\nexhibit to the registration statement or annual report? Are there some climate-related disclosure\nitems, such as GHG emissions data, that we should not permit a registrant to incorporate by\nreference? Would requiring a registrant to include all of the proposed climate-related disclosures\nin a separate, appropriately captioned section, while precluding a registrant from incorporating\nby reference some or all of the climate-related disclosures, promote comparability and ease of\nuse of the climate-related information for investors?\n7. Should we permit a registrant to provide certain of the proposed climate-related\ndisclosures in Commission filings other than the annual report or registration statement? For\nexample, should we permit a registrant to provide information about board and management\noversight of climate-related risks in its proxy statement?\n54"

Disclosure of Climate-Related Risks\nAs many commenters have noted when seeking more detailed climate-related\ndisclosures,174 climate events and contingencies can pose financial risks to issuers across\nindustrial sectors.175 Physical risks may include harm to businesses and their assets arising from\nacute climate-related disasters such as wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and heatwaves.\nCompanies and their investors may also face chronic risks and more gradual impacts from long-\nterm temperature increases, drought, and sea level rise.\nIn addition to the physical risks associated with the climate, issuers and investors may\nalso face risks associated with a potential transition to a less carbon intensive economy. These\nrisks may arise from potential adoption of climate-related regulatory policies including those that\nmay be necessary to achieve the national climate goals that may be or have been adopted in the\nUnited States and other countries;176 climate-related litigation; changing consumer, investor, and\nemployee behavior and choices; changing demands of business partners; long-term shifts in\nmarket prices; technological challenges and opportunities, and other transitional impacts.\n174 See supra note 40.\n175 The 2020 CFTC Advisory Subcommittee Report found that climate change currently impacts or is expected to\naffect every part of the U.S. economy, including agriculture, real estate, infrastructure, and the financial sectors.\nSee infra note 361.\n176 A National Climate Taskforce created by the president established commitments to reduce economy-wide net\ngreenhouse gas emissions by 50-52% by 2030 as compared to 2005 levels, and to reach net zero emissions by\n2050. See The White House, FACT SHEET: President Biden Sets 2030 Greenhouse Gas Pollution Reduction\nTarget Aimed at Creating Good-Paying Union Jobs and Securing U.S. Leadership on Clean\nEnergy Technologies (Apr. 22, 2021). An Executive Order also directs the Federal government to achieve net-\nzero emissions from overall Federal operations by 2050, and a 65% emissions reduction by 2030.

    "text": "Disclosure about a registrant\u2019s exposure to transition risks, as well as how the registrant is\nassessing and managing those risks, would help investors assess and plan for how the registrant\nwould be financially impacted by a transition to a lower-carbon economy.\n1. Definitions of Climate-Related Risks and Climate-Related Opportunities\nA central focus of the Commission\u2019s proposed rules is the identification and disclosure of\na registrant\u2019s material climate-related risks. The proposed rules would require a registrant to\ndisclose any climate-related risks reasonably likely to have a material impact on the registrant\u2019s\nbusiness or consolidated financial statements.177 A registrant may also disclose, as applicable,\nthe actual and potential impacts of any climate-related opportunities it is pursuing.178 The\nproposed definitions are substantially similar to the TCFD\u2019s definitions of climate-related risks\nand climate-related opportunities.179 We have based our definitions on the TCFD\u2019s definitions\nbecause they provide a common terminology that allows registrants to disclose climate-related\nrisks and opportunities in a consistent and comparable way. Grounding our definitions in a\nframework that is already widely accepted also could help limit the burden on issuers to identify\nand describe climate-related risks and improve the comparability and usefulness of the\ndisclosures for investors.\nAs proposed, \u201cclimate-related risks\u201d means the actual or potential negative impacts of\nclimate-related conditions and events on a registrant\u2019s consolidated financial statements,\n177 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(a).\n178 See id.\n179 See TCFD, Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, Appendix 5.\n56\n\nbusiness operations, or value chains, as a whole.180 \u201cValue chain\u201d would mean the upstream and\ndownstream activities related to a registrant\u2019s operations.181 Under the proposed definition,\nupstream activities include activities by a party other than the registrant that relate to the initial\nstages of a registrant\u2019s production of a good or service (e.g., materials sourcing, materials\nprocessing, and supplier activities). Downstream activities would be defined to include activities\nby a party other than the registrant that relate to processing materials into a finished product and\ndelivering it or providing a service to the end user (e.g., transportation and distribution,\nprocessing of sold products, use of sold products, end of life treatment of sold products, and\ninvestments).182 We have proposed including a registrant\u2019s value chain within the definition of\nclimate-related risks to capture the full extent of a registrant\u2019s potential exposure to climate-\nrelated risks, which can extend beyond its own operations to those of its suppliers, distributors,\nand others engaged in upstream or downstream activities.183\nClimate-related conditions and events can present risks related to the physical impacts of\nthe climate (\u201cphysical risks\u201d) and risks related to a potential transition to a lower carbon\neconomy (\u201ctransition risks\u201d). As proposed, \u201cphysical risks\u201d is defined to include both acute and\nchronic risks to a registrant\u2019s business operations or the operations of those with whom it does\nbusiness.184 \u201cAcute risks\u201d is defined as event-driven risks related to shorter-term extreme\n180 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(c). The reference to \u2018negative\u2019 impact is intended to refer to the actual or\npotential impact on the registrant\u2019s consolidated financial statements, business operations, or value chains as a\nwhole, rather than the mathematical impacts on a specific financial statement line item. See infra Section II.F.2\n(discussing the proposed financial impact metrics, which focus on the line items in a registrant\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial statements).\n181 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(t).\n182 See id.\n183 See, e.g., infra Section II.G.1.\n184 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(c)(1).\n57\n\nweather events, such as hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes.185 \u201cChronic risks\u201d is defined as those\nrisks that the business may face as a result of longer term weather patterns and related effects,\nsuch as sustained higher temperatures, sea level rise, drought, and increased wildfires, as well as\nrelated effects such as decreased arability of farmland, decreased habitability of land, and\ndecreased availability of fresh water.186 Many of these physical risks have already impacted and\nmay continue to impact registrants across a wide range of economic sectors.187\nThe proposed rules would define transition risks to mean the actual or potential negative\nimpacts on a registrant\u2019s consolidated financial statements, business operations, or value chains\nattributable to regulatory, technological, and market changes to address the mitigation of, or\nadaptation to, climate-related risks.188 Transition risks would include, but are not limited to,\nincreased costs attributable to climate-related changes in law or policy, reduced market demand\nfor carbon-intensive products leading to decreased sales, prices, or profits for such products, the\ndevaluation or abandonment of assets, risk of legal liability and litigation defense costs,\ncompetitive pressures associated with the adoption of new technologies, reputational impacts\n(including those stemming from a registrant\u2019s customers or business counterparties) that might\ntrigger changes to market behavior, changes in consumer preferences or behavior, or changes in\na registrant\u2019s behavior. A registrant that has significant operations in a jurisdiction that has made\n185 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(c)(2).\n186 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(c)(3). The physical risks described are examples, but registrants may be\nexposed to many other types of physical risks from climate change depending on their specific facts and\ncircumstances. As such, any reference to certain types of risks should be considered as non-exhaustive\nexamples.\n187 The IPCC\u2019s Sixth Assessment Report noted drought, heatwaves, hurricanes, and heavy precipitation. See IPCC,\nClimate Change 2021, The Physical Science Basis Summary for Policymakers.\n188 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(c)(4).\n58\n\na GHG emissions reduction commitment would likely be exposed to transition risks related to\nthe implementation of the commitment.189\nThe proposed rules would require a registrant to specify whether an identified climate-\nrelated risk is a physical or transition risk so that investors can better understand the nature of the\nrisk190 and the registrant\u2019s actions or plan to mitigate or adapt to the risk.191 If a physical risk,\nthe proposed rules would require a registrant to describe the nature of the risk, including whether\nit may be categorized as an acute or chronic risk.192\nThe proposed rules would require a registrant to include in its description of an identified\nphysical risk the location of the properties, processes, or operations subject to the physical\nrisk.193 The proposed location disclosure would only be required for a physical risk that a\nregistrant has determined has had or is likely to have a material impact on its business or\nconsolidated financial statements. In such instances, a registrant would be required to provide\nthe ZIP code for the location or, if the location is in a jurisdiction that does not use ZIP codes, a\nsimilar subnational postal zone or geographic location.194 Because physical risks can be\nconcentrated in particular geographic areas, the proposed disclosure would allow investors to\nbetter assess the risk exposure of one or more registrants with properties or operations in a\nparticular area. One commenter cited location information as a key component of how it, as an\n189 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(a)(1)(ii).\n190 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(a)(1).\n191 See, e.g., proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(b)(1) and 229.1503(c)(1) and (2).\n192 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(a)(1)(i). In some instances, chronic risks might give rise to acute risks. For\nexample, drought (a chronic risk) that increases acute risks, such as wildfires, or increased temperatures (a\nchronic risk) that increases acute risks, such as severe storms. In such instances, a registrant should provide a\nclear and consistent description of the nature of the risk and how it may affect a related risk.\n193 See id.\n194 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(k).\n59\n\ninvestor, assesses the climate risk facing a company, particularly for companies with fixed assets\nthat may be disproportionately exposed to climate-related physical risks.195 Several other\ncommenters recommended that we require the disclosure of certain climate data to be\ndisaggregated by location using a point source\u2019s zip code for risk assessment.196 Disclosing the\nzip codes of its identified material climate-related risks, rather than a broader location\ndesignation, could help investors more accurately assess a registrant\u2019s specific risk exposure.\nSome registrants might be exposed to water-related acute physical risks, such as flooding,\nwhich could impair a registrant\u2019s operations or devalue its property. If flooding presents a\nmaterial physical risk, the proposed rules would require a registrant to disclose the percentage of\nbuildings, plants, or properties (square meters or acres) that are located in flood hazard areas in\naddition to their location.197 This information could help investors evaluate the magnitude of a\nregistrant\u2019s exposure to flooding, which, for example, could cause a registrant in the real estate\nsector to lose revenues from the rental or sale of coastal property or incur higher costs or a\ndiminished ability to obtain property insurance, or a manufacturing registrant to incur increased\nexpenses due to the need to replace water-damaged equipment or move an entire plant.\nAdditional disclosure would be required if a material risk concerns the location of assets\nin regions of high or extremely high water stress.198 For example, some registrants might be\nimpacted by water-related chronic physical risks, such as increased temperatures and changes in\nweather patterns that result in water scarcity. Registrants that are heavily reliant on water for\n195 See letter from Wellington Management Co.\n196 See letters from Action Center on Race and Economy (June 14, 2021); Americans for Financial Reform\nEducation Fund; Confluence Philanthropy; Domini Impact Investments; William and Flora Hewlett Foundation;\nPublic Citizen; and Revolving Door Project.\n197 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(a)(1)(i)(A).\n198 See proposed 1502(a)(1)(i)(B).\n60\n\ntheir operations, such as registrants in the energy sector, materials and buildings sector, or\nagriculture sector,199 could face regulatory restrictions on water use, increased expenses related\nto the acquisition and purchase of alternative sources of water, or curtailment of its operations\ndue to a reduced water supply that diminishes its earning capacity. If the location of assets in\nregions of high or extremely high water stress presents a material risk, the proposed rules would\nrequire a registrant to disclose the amount of assets (e.g., book value and as a percentage of total\nassets) located in such regions in addition to their location. The registrant would also be required\nto disclose the percentage of its total water usage from water withdrawn in those regions.200\nThese disclosures could help investors understand the magnitude of a registrant\u2019s material water-\nstress risks with a degree of specificity that might not be elicited under our current risk factor\ndisclosure standards.\nAny increased temperatures could also materially impact a registrant in other ways. For\nexample, a registrant in the construction industry might be required to disclose the physical risk\nof increased heat waves that affect the ability of its personnel to safely work outdoors, which\ncould result in a cessation or delay of operations, and a reduction in its current or future\nearnings.201 A registrant operating in wildfire-prone areas could be exposed to potential\ndisruption of operations, destruction of property, and relocation of personnel in the event of heat-\n199 Registrants in these industry sectors could be particularly susceptible to water-stress risks because operations in\nthese sectors require large amounts of water. See TCFD, Implementing the Recommendations of the Task Force\non Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, Section E (Oct. 2021), available at\nhttps://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/60/2021/07/2021-TCFD-Implementing_Guidance.pdf (discussing the\nlisted events and other risks).\n200 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(a)(1)(i)(B).\n201 See, e.g. How Seasonal Temperature Changes Affect the Construction Industry (constructconnect.com) (Aug.\n15, 2018), available at https://www.constructconnect.com/blog/seasonal-temperature-changes-affect-\nconstruction-industry.\n61\n\ninduced wildfires.202 A registrant in the real estate sector might similarly be required to disclose\nthe likelihood that sea levels could rise faster than expected and reduce the value of its coastal\nproperties.203\nThe proposed rules would require a registrant to describe the nature of transition risks,\nincluding whether they relate to regulatory, technological, market (including changing consumer,\nbusiness counterparty, and investor preferences), liability, reputational, or other transition-related\nfactors, and how those factors impact the registrant.204 For example, an automobile manufacturer\nmight describe how market factors, such as changing consumer and investor preferences for low-\nemission vehicles, have impacted or will likely impact its production choices, operational\ncapabilities, and future expenditures. An energy producer might describe how regulatory and\nreputational factors have impacted or are likely to impact its operational activities, reserve\nvaluations, and investments in renewable energy. An industrial manufacturer might describe\nhow investments in innovative technologies, such as carbon capture and storage, have impacted\nor are likely to impact its consolidated financial statements, such as by increasing its capital\nexpenditures.\nClimate related conditions and any transition to a lower carbon economy may also\npresent opportunities for companies and investors. The proposed rules would define \u201cclimate-\nrelated opportunities\u201d to mean the actual or potential positive impacts of climate-related\nconditions and events on a registrant\u2019s consolidated financial statements, business operations, or\n202 See, e.g., The Impact of Wildfires on Business is Enormous | Are You Ready?

We are proposing to treat this disclosure\nas optional to allay any anti-competitive concerns that might arise from a requirement to disclose\na particular business opportunity.206 By defining \u201cclimate-related opportunities,\u201d the proposed\nrules would promote consistency when such opportunities are disclosed, even if such disclosure\nis not required.\n2. Proposed Time Horizons and the Materiality Determination\nThe proposed rules would require a registrant to disclose whether any climate-related risk\nis reasonably likely to have a material impact on a registrant, including its business or\nconsolidated financial statements, which may manifest over the short, medium, and long term.207\nSeveral commenters made a similar recommendation, stating that disclosure of climate-related\n205 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(b). The reference to \u2018positive\u2019 impact is intended to refer to the actual or\npotential impact on the registrant\u2019s consolidated financial statements, business operations, or value chains as a\nwhole, rather than the mathematical impacts on a specific financial statement line item. See infra Section II.F.2\n(discussing the proposed financial impact metrics, which focus on the line items in a registrant\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial statements).\n206 Some commenters expressed concern about potential anti-competitive effects of the Commission\u2019s possible\nclimate disclosure rules. See, e.g., letters from Association of General Contractors of America (June 11, 2021);\nand Healthy Markets Association (June 14, 2021).\n207 See proposed Item 1502(a) of Regulation S-K.\n63\n\nrisks and impacts across short, medium, and long-term time horizons is necessary to fully\nunderstand a registrant\u2019s susceptibility to material climate-related risks.208\nAs proposed, a registrant would be required to describe how it defines short-, medium-,\nand long-term time horizons, including how it takes into account or reassesses the expected\nuseful life of the registrant\u2019s assets and the time horizons for the registrant\u2019s planning processes\nand goals. We have not proposed a specific range of years to define short-, medium-, and long-\nterm time horizons in order to allow flexibility for a registrant to select the time horizons that are\nmost appropriate to its particular circumstances.\nAs defined by the Commission and consistent with Supreme Court precedent, a matter is\nmaterial if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important\nwhen determining whether to buy or sell securities or how to vote.209 As the Commission has\npreviously indicated, the materiality determination is largely fact specific and one that requires\nboth quantitative and qualitative considerations.210 Moreover, as the Supreme Court has\narticulated, the materiality determination with regard to potential future events requires an\n208 See, e.g., letters from Boston Common Asset Management; Christian Brothers Investment Services (June 11,\n2021); Clean Yield Asset Management; and Miller/Howard Investments; see also American Institute of CPAs\n(AICPA) (June 11, 2021).\n209 See 17 CFR 240.12b-2 (definition of \u201cmaterial\u201d). See also Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 231, 232, and\n240 (1988) (holding that information is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor\nwould consider the information important in deciding how to vote or make an investment decision; and\nquoting TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U. S. 438, 449 (1977) to further explain that an omitted fact\nis material if there is \u201ca substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by\nthe reasonable investor as having significantly altered the \u2018total mix\u2019 of information made available.\u201d).\n210 See Release No. 33-10064, Business and Financial Disclosure Required by Regulation S-K (Apr. 13, 2016), [81\nFR 23915 (Apr. 22, 2016)] (discussing materiality in the context of, among other matters, restating financial\nstatements). See also Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99 (Aug. 12, 1999), available at\nhttps://www.sec.gov/interps/account/sab99.htm (emphasizing that a registrant or an auditor may not substitute a\npercentage threshold for a materiality determination that is required by applicable accounting principles). Staff\naccounting bulletins are not rules or interpretations of the Commission, nor are they published as bearing the\nCommission's official approval. They represent interpretations and practices followed by the Division of\nCorporation Finance and the Office of the Chief Accountant in administering the disclosure requirements of the\nFederal securities laws.\n64\n\nassessment of both the probability of the event occurring and its potential magnitude, or\nsignificance to the registrant.211\nThe materiality determination that a registrant would be required to make regarding\nclimate-related risks under the proposed rules is similar to what is required when preparing the\nMD&A section in a registration statement or annual report. The Commission\u2019s rules require a\nregistrant to disclose material events and uncertainties known to management that are reasonably\nlikely to cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating\nresults or of future financial condition.212 As the Commission has stated, MD&A should include\ndescriptions and amounts of matters that have had a material impact on reported operations as\nwell as matters that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on future operations.213\nThe proposed rule serves to emphasize that, when assessing the materiality of a particular\nrisk, management should consider its magnitude and probability over the short, medium, and\nlong term. In the context of climate, the magnitude and probability of such risks vary and can be\nsignificant over such time periods. For example, wildfires in California, which recently have\nbecome more frequent and more intense, may be a material risk for wineries, farmers, and other\nproperty owners.214 Some insurance companies have withdrawn from certain wildfire prone\n211 See Basic, Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 238 (1988). When considering the materiality of different climate-\nrelated risks, a registrant might, for example, determine that certain transition risks and chronic physical risks\nare material when balancing their likelihood and impact. It also might determine that certain acute physical\nrisks are material even if they are less likely to occur if the magnitude of their impact would be high.\n212 See 17 CFR 229.303(a).\n213 See Release No. 33-10890, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis, Selected Financial Data, and\nSupplementary Financial Information (Nov. 19, 2020), [86 FR 2080, 2089 (Jan. 11, 2021)].\n214 See, e.g., Daoping Wang, Dabo Guan, Shupeng Zhu, et al., Economic footprint of California wildfires in 2018,\nNature Sustainability (Dec. 2020) (stating that the frequency and size of wildfires in the western United States\n65\n\nareas after concluding the risk is no longer insurable.215 For many investors, the availability of\ninsurance and the potential exposure to damage, loss, and legal liability from wildfires may be a\ndetermining factor in their investment decision-making. Moreover, registrants must bear in mind\nthat the materiality determination is made with regard to the information that a reasonable\ninvestor considers important to an investment or voting decision.\nTo help ensure that management considers the dynamic nature of climate-related risks,\nwe are proposing to require a registrant to discuss its assessment of the materiality of climate-\nrelated risks over the short, medium, and long term. We recognize that determining the likely\nfuture impacts on a registrant\u2019s business may be difficult for some registrants. Commenters have\nnoted that the science of climate modelling has progressed in recent years and enabled the\ndevelopment of various software tools and that climate consulting firms are available to assist\nregistrants in making this determination.216 We also note that, under our existing rules,\nregistrants long have had to disclose forward-looking information, including pursuant to MD&A\nrequirements. To the extent that the proposed climate-related disclosures constitute forward-\nlooking statements, as discussed below,217 the forward-looking statement safe harbors pursuant\nhas been increasing for several decades, driven by decreases in precipitation and related changes in the moisture\nin vegetation, which, together with land use and fire management practices, has dramatically increased wildfire\nrisks, culminating in a series of enormously damaging fires in California in 2017, 2018 and 2020); Andrew\nFreedman, California wildfires prompt new warnings amid record heat, erratic winds, the Washington Post\n(Oct. 1, 2020) (reporting that the \u201cGlass Fire\u201d forced about 80,000 to evacuate from Napa and Sonoma Counties\nand took a heavy toll on the wine industry).\n215 See Shelby Vittek, California Farmers Struggle to Secure Wildfire Insurance Coverage, Modern Farmer (Aug.\n2, 2021), available at https://modernfarmer.com/2021/08/california-farmers-struggle-to-secure-wildfire-\ninsurance-coverage/\n216 See, e.g., letters from AIR Worldwide (June 11, 2021); Coastal Risk Consulting (May 3, 2021); CoreLogic\n(June 12, 2021); Datamaran (June 14, 2021); Dynamhex, Inc.

For example, we are proposing that climate-\nrelated disclosures would be required in registration statements, including those for initial public\nofferings, and forward-looking statements made in connection with an initial public offering are\nexcluded from the protections afforded by the PSLRA. In addition, the PSLRA does not limit\nthe Commission\u2019s ability to bring enforcement actions.\nRequest for Comment\n8. Should we require a registrant to disclose any climate-related risks that are reasonably\nlikely to have a material impact on the registrant, including on its business or consolidated\nfinancial statements, which may manifest over the short, medium, and long term, as proposed?\nIf so, should we specify a particular time period, or minimum or maximum range of years, for\n\u201cshort,\u201d \u201cmedium,\u201d and \u201clong term?\u201d For example, should we define short term as 1 year, 1-3\nyears, or 1-5 years? Should we define medium term as 5-10 years, 5-15 years, or 5-20 years?\nShould we define long-term as 10-20 years, 20-30 years, or 30-50 years? Are there other\npossible years or ranges of years that we should consider as the definitions of short, medium, and\nlong term? What, if any, are the benefits to leaving those terms undefined? What, if any, are the\n218 Pub. Law 104-67, 109 Stat. 737.\n219 See Securities Act Section 27A and Exchange Act Section 21E. The statutory safe harbors by their terms do not\napply to forward-looking statements included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). The statutory safe harbors also would not apply to forward-looking\nstatements made: (i) in connection with an initial public offering; a tender offer; an offering by, or relating to\nthe operations of, a partnership, limited liability company, or a direct participation investment program, an\noffering of securities by a blank check company; a roll-up transaction; or a going private transaction; or (ii) by\nan issuer of penny stock. See Section 27A(b) of the Securities Act and Section 21E(b) of the Exchange Act.\nAlso, the statutory safe harbors do not, absent a rule, regulation, or Commission order, apply to forward-looking\nstatements by certain \u201cbad actor\u201d issuers under Section 27A(b)(1)(A) of the Securities Act and Section\n21E(b)(1)(A) of the Exchange Act.\n67\n\nconcerns to leaving those terms undefined? Would the proposed provision requiring a registrant\nto specify what it means by the short, medium, and long term mitigate any such concerns?\n9. Should we define \u201cclimate-related risks\u201d to mean the actual or potential negative impacts\nof climate-related conditions and events on a registrant\u2019s consolidated financial statements,\nbusiness operations, or value chains, as proposed? Should we define climate-related risks to\ninclude both physical and transition risks, as proposed? Should we define physical risks to\ninclude both acute and chronic risks and define each of those risks, as proposed? Should we\ndefine transition risks, as proposed? Are there any aspects of the definitions of climate-related\nrisks, physical risks, acute risks, chronic risks, and transition risks that we should revise? Are\nthere other distinctions among types of climate-related risks that we should use in our\ndefinitions? Are there any risks that we should add to the definition of transition risk? How\nshould we address risks that may involve both physical and transition risks?\n10. We define transition risks to include legal liability, litigation, or reputational risks.\nShould we provide more examples about these types of risks? Should we require more specific\ndisclosures about how a registrant assesses and manages material legal liability, litigation, or\nreputational risks that may arise from a registrant\u2019s business operations, climate mitigation\nefforts, or transition activities?\n11. Some chronic risks might give rise to acute risks, e.g., drought (a chronic risk) that\nincreases acute risks, such as wildfires, or increased temperatures (a chronic risk) that increases\nacute risks, such as severe storms. Should we require a registrant to discuss how the acute and\nchronic risks they face may affect one another?\n12. For the location of its business operations, properties or processes subject to an identified\nmaterial physical risk, should we require a registrant to provide the ZIP code of the location or, if\n68\n\nlocated in a jurisdiction that does not use ZIP codes, a similar subnational postal zone or\ngeographic location, as proposed? Is there another location identifier that we should use for all\nregistrants, such as the county, province, municipality or other subnational jurisdiction? Would\nrequiring granular location information, such as ZIP codes, present concerns about competitive\nharm or the physical security of assets? If so, how can we mitigate those concerns? Are there\nexceptions or exemptions to a granular location disclosure requirement that we should consider?\n13. If a registrant determines that the flooding of its buildings, plants, or properties is a\nmaterial risk, should we require it to disclose the percentage of those assets that are in flood\nhazard areas in addition to their location, as proposed? Would such disclosure help investors\nevaluate the registrant\u2019s exposure to physical risks related to floods? Should we require this\ndisclosure from all registrants, including those that do not currently consider exposure to\nflooding to be a material physical risk? Should we require this disclosure from all registrants\noperating in certain industrial sectors and, if so, which sectors? Should we define \u201cflood hazard\narea\u201d or provide examples of such areas? If we should define the term, should we define it\nsimilar to a related definition by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (\u201cFEMA\u201d) as an\narea having flood, mudflow or flood-related erosion hazards, as depicted on a flood hazard\nboundary map or a flood insurance rate map? Should we require a registrant to disclose how it\nhas defined \u201cflood hazard area\u201d or whether it has used particular maps or software tools when\ndetermining whether its buildings, plants, or properties are located in flood hazard areas? Should\nwe recommend that certain maps be used to promote comparability? Should we require\ndisclosure of whether a registrant\u2019s assets are located in zones that are subject to other physical\nrisks, such as in locations subject to wildfire risk?\n69\n\n14. If a material risk concerns the location of assets in regions of high or extremely high\nwater stress, should we require a registrant to quantify the assets (e.g., book value and as a\npercentage of total assets) in those regions in addition to their location, as proposed? Should we\nalso require such a registrant to disclose the percentage of its total water usage from water\nwithdrawn in high or extremely high water stressed regions, as proposed? If so, should we\ninclude a definition of a \u201chigh water stressed region\u201d similar to the definition provided by the\nWorld Resource Institute as a region where 40-80 percent of the water available to agricultural,\ndomestic, and industrial users is withdrawn annually? Should we similarly define an \u201cextremely\nhigh water stressed area\u201d as a region where more than 80 percent of the water available to\nagricultural, domestic, and industrial users is withdrawn annually? Are there other definitions of\nhigh or extremely high water stressed areas we should use for purposes of this disclosure?\nWould these items of information help investors assess a registrant\u2019s exposure to climate-related\nrisks impacting water availability? Should we require the disclosure of these items of\ninformation from all registrants, including those that do not currently consider having assets in\nhigh water-stressed areas a material physical risk? Should we require these disclosures from all\nregistrants operating in certain industrial sectors and, if so, which sectors?\n15. Are there other specific metrics that would provide investors with a better understanding\nof the physical and transition risks facing registrants? How would investors benefit from the\ndisclosure of any additional metrics that would not necessarily be disclosed or disclosed in a\nconsistent manner by the proposed climate risk disclosures? What, if any, additional burdens\nwould registrants face if they were required to disclose additional climate risk metrics?\n70\n\n16. Are there other areas that should be included as examples in the definitions of acute or\nchronic risks? If so, for each example, please explain how the particular climate-related risk\ncould materially impact a registrant\u2019s operations or financial condition.\n17. Should we include the negative impacts on a registrant\u2019s value chain in the definition of\nclimate-related risks, as proposed? Should we define \u201cvalue chain\u201d to mean the upstream and\ndownstream activities related to a registrant\u2019s operations, as proposed? Are there any upstream\nor downstream activities included in the proposed definition of value chain that we should\nexclude or revise? Are there any upstream or downstream activities that we should add to the\ndefinition of value chain? Are there any upstream or downstream activities currently proposed\nthat should not be included?\n18. Should we define climate-related opportunities as proposed? Should we permit a\nregistrant, at its option, to disclose information about any climate-related opportunities that it is\npursuing, such as the actual or potential impacts of those opportunities on the registrant,\nincluding its business or consolidated financial statements, as proposed? Should we specifically\nrequire a registrant to provide disclosure about any climate-related opportunities that have\nmaterially impacted or are reasonably likely to impact materially the registrant, including its\nbusiness or consolidated financial statements? Is there a risk that the disclosure of climate-\nrelated opportunities could be misleading and lead to \u201cgreenwashing\u201d? If so, how should this\nrisk be addressed?\n71"

    "text": "C. Disclosure Regarding Climate-Related Impacts on Strategy, Business Model,\nand Outlook\n1. Disclosure of Material Impacts\nOnce a registrant has described the climate-related risks reasonably likely to have a\nmaterial impact on the registrant\u2019s business or consolidated financial statements as manifested\nover the short, medium, and long term as required by proposed Item 1502(a), proposed Item\n1502(b) would require the registrant to describe the actual and potential impacts of those risks on\nits strategy, business model, and outlook.220 Several commenters stated that many registrants\nhave included largely boilerplate discussions about climate-related risks and failed to provide a\nmeaningful analysis of the impacts of those risks on their businesses.221 The TCFD\u2019s most\nrecent assessment of public companies\u2019 voluntary climate reports also noted that a minority of\ncompanies disclosed the impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on their businesses in\nalignment with the TCFD framework.222 Because information about how climate-related risks\nhave impacted or are likely to impact a registrant\u2019s strategy, business model, and outlook can be\nimportant for purposes of making an investment or voting decision about the registrant, we are\nproposing the provisions below to elicit robust and company-specific disclosure on this topic.\nAs proposed, a registrant would be required to disclose impacts on its:\n\u2022 Business operations, including the types and locations of its operations;\n220 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(b).\n221 See, e.g., letters from CALSTRS; Cardano Risk Management Ltd.; Climate Risk Disclosure Lab (June 14,\n2021); and Colorado PERA (June 11, 2021).\n222 See TCFD, 2021 Status Report, Section B (Oct. 2021) (stating that, based on a review of reports of 1,651 public\ncompanies from 2018-2020, while 38-52% of companies surveyed described climate-related risks and\nopportunities during 2018-2020, only 26-39% disclosed the impacts of those risks and opportunities during this\nperiod).\n72\n\n\u2022 Products or services;\n\u2022 Suppliers and other parties in its value chain;\n\u2022 Activities to mitigate or adapt to climate-related risks, including adoption of new\ntechnologies or processes;\n\u2022 Expenditure for research and development; and\n\u2022 Any other significant changes or impacts.223\nA registrant would also be required to disclose the time horizon for each described impact\n(i.e., as manifested in the short, medium, or long term, as defined by the registrant when\ndetermining its material climate-related risks).224\nThe proposed rules would require a registrant to discuss how it has considered the\nidentified impacts as part of its business strategy, financial planning, and capital allocation.225 A\nregistrant would be required to provide both current and forward-looking disclosures226 that\nfacilitate an understanding of whether the implications of the identified climate-related risks have\nbeen integrated into the registrant\u2019s business model or strategy, including how resources are\nbeing used to mitigate climate-related risks.227 The discussion must also include how any of the\nmetrics referenced in proposed Rule 14-02 of Regulation S-X and Item 1504 of Regulation S-K\nor any of the targets referenced in proposed Item 1506 relate to the registrant\u2019s business model or\nbusiness strategy.228\n223 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(b)(1).\n224 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(b)(2).\n225 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(c).\n226 See infra Sections II.C.3 and 4, II.E, II.G.1, and II.I regarding the application to forward-looking climate\ndisclosures of the PSLRA safe harbor for forward-looking statements.\n227 See id.\n228 See infra Sections II.F and II.G for a discussion of the proposed metrics and targets.\n73\n\nFor example, a registrant that operates in a jurisdiction that has imposed or is likely to\nimpose limits on GHG emissions in support of the Paris Agreement might set a long-term target\nof net zero GHG emissions from its operations in 2050, a medium-term target of reducing its\nemissions by 30 percent by 2030, and a short-term target of maintaining its emissions at its 2020\nrate through 2023. This registrant could face material transition risks due to the estimated costs\nof the operational changes expected to be implemented to achieve these targets. The registrant\nwould be required to disclose these transition risks and their impacts on its strategy, business\nmodel, and outlook.\nSome of the described impacts would likely be common across industries and may\ninvolve reducing a registrant\u2019s Scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions229 and incurring increased\nexpenses in the short term related to, for example, acquiring new technology to curb its\noperational emissions and increasing the amount of electricity purchased from renewable\nsources. Other described impacts of material transition risks, however, would likely vary by\nindustry. For example, an oil company might determine that a likely change in demand for fossil\nfuel-based products would require it to modify its business model or alter its product mix to\nemphasize advanced diesel gas and biofuels in order to maintain or increase its earning capacity,\nthereby requiring disclosure under the proposed rules. An electric utilities company might\ndisclose an increase in the amount of electricity generated from less carbon-intensive sources,\nsuch as wind turbines, nuclear, hydroelectric, or solar power to meet current or likely regulatory\nconstraints.\n229 See supra Section I.D.2 and infra Section II.G for a discussion of Scopes 1 and 2 emissions.\n74\n\nA registrant would also be required to disclose the material impacts of physical risks on\nits strategy, business model, and outlook. For example, an agricultural producer or distributor\nmight disclose the likely impacts of drought on its own product mix or that of its suppliers,\nincluding increased expenses for additional water or due to the procurement of alternative\nproduct sources. Similarly, a mining company that operates in areas susceptible to extreme rise\nin temperatures might disclose the likely impacts that this temperature rise has on its workforce\nand on its production schedule, including a reduction in output and future earning capacity. A\nreal estate company that owns coastal property might disclose the likely impacts of rising sea\nlevels on such property, including the potential diminution in value of, and a potential change in\nits strategy and outlook regarding, such properties.\nThe proposed rules would require a registrant to provide a narrative discussion of\nwhether and how any of its identified climate-related risks described in response to proposed\nItem 1502(a) have affected or are reasonably likely to affect the registrant\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial statements.230 The discussion should include any of the financial statement metrics\ndisclosed pursuant to proposed Regulation S-X Rule 14-02.231 As previously noted, many\ncommenters recommended that we require registrants to discuss and analyze their quantitative\nclimate data in a manner similar to that required for MD&A.232 Proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(d)\n(Item 1502(d) of Regulation S-K) is intended to provide climate-related disclosure that is similar\n230 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(d). To the extent that the proposed narrative discussion is provided in its\nMD&A, a registrant could incorporate by reference that part of the MD&A into the Climate-Related Disclosure\nsection of the registration statement or report. See supra Section II.A.2.\n231 See infra Section II.F.\n232 See supra note 171.\n75\n\nto MD&A, although, as previously noted, a registrant may provide such disclosure as part of its\nMD&A.\nFor example, an automobile manufacturer might discuss an increase in operating costs or\ncapital expenditures due to the need to revamp its assembly lines to build lower emission\nvehicles to comply with new regulatory guidelines or to meet changing consumer demand. An\noil company might discuss a change in the valuation of its proven reserves because of an\nanticipated reduced demand for fossil fuels. A freight company might discuss impairment\ncharges or early write-offs for older equipment it might need to replace due to anticipated\nchanges in regulation or policy favoring lower emissions equipment. While a registrant may\ncurrently have an obligation to make some of these disclosures pursuant to Regulation S-X, the\ndisclosed impacts in the financial statements may not be in disaggregated form and may lack\nexplanation. Proposed Item 1502(d) would require the disclosure in the form of a narrative\nanalysis akin to MD&A that would be more easily accessible for investors.\nMoreover, it is likely that any disclosed impacts in the financial statements would be\nassessed for the fiscal years presented in the financial statements with a focus on near short-term\nimpacts. Because proposed Item 1502 would require a registrant to identify material climate-\nrelated impacts that may manifest in the short, medium, and long term, a registrant\u2019s narrative\ndiscussion of the likely climate-related impacts on its consolidated financial statements should\ncover more than just short-term impacts. For example, if a registrant has a transition plan233 that\nincludes the development of lower carbon products and processes, that registrant might disclose\nthat it expects to incur higher initial capital costs to implement its strategy, but anticipates\n233 See infra Section II.E for proposed disclosure requirements regarding the use of a transition plan.\n76"

Disclosure of Carbon Offsets or Renewable Energy Credits If Used\nIf, as part of its net emissions reduction strategy, a registrant uses carbon offsets or\nrenewable energy credits or certificates (\u201cRECs\u201d), the proposed rules would require it to disclose\nthe role that carbon offsets or RECs play in the registrant\u2019s climate-related business strategy.234\nUnder the proposed rules, carbon offsets represent an emissions reduction or removal of\ngreenhouse gases in a manner calculated and traced for the purpose of offsetting an entity\u2019s GHG\nemissions.235 We are proposing to define a REC, consistent with the EPA\u2019s commonly used\ndefinition, to mean a credit or certificate representing each purchased megawatt-hour (1 MWh or\n1000 kilowatt-hours) of renewable electricity generated and delivered to a registrant\u2019s power\ngrid.236 While both carbon offsets and RECs represent commonly used GHG emissions\nmitigation options for companies, they are used for somewhat different purposes.237\n234 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(c).\n235 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(a).\n236 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(n).

They\nthen might plan to use carbon offsets or RECs to offset the remainder of their emissions that they\ncannot reduce through operational changes or to meet their GHG reduction goals while they\ntransition to lower carbon operations.\nUnderstanding the role that carbon offsets or RECs play in a registrant\u2019s climate-related\nbusiness strategy can help investors gain useful information about the registrant\u2019s strategy,\nincluding the potential risks and financial impacts. A registrant that relies on carbon offsets or\nRECs to meet its goals might incur lower expenses in the short term but could expect to continue\nto incur the expense of purchasing offsets or RECs over the long term.

In contrast, a company\nmay purchase a REC in renewable electricity markets solely to address its indirect GHG emissions associated\nwith purchased electricity (i.e., Scope 2 emissions) by verifying the use of zero- or low-emissions renewable\nsources of electricity. Each REC provides its owner exclusive rights to the attributes of one megawatt-hour of\nrenewable electricity whether that renewable electricity has been installed on the company\u2019s facilities or\nproduced elsewhere.

SBTi provides technical\nassistance and its expertise to companies who voluntarily set science-based targets in line with the latest climate\nscience. See SBTi, Who We Are/What We Do, available at https://sciencebasedtargets.org/about-us#who-we-\nare. The SBTi does not permit offsets to be counted toward a company\u2019s emission reduction targets to meet its\nscience-based targets but does permit offsets by companies that wish to finance additional emission reductions\nbeyond their science-based targets.

Alternatively, the value of an offset may decrease\nsubstantially and suddenly if, for example, the offset represents protected forest land that burns\nin a wildfire and no longer represents a reduction in GHG emissions. In that case, the registrant\nmay need to write off the offset and purchase a replacement. In other cases, increased demand\nfor, or scarcity of, offsets and RECs may benefit a registrant that produces or generates offsets or\nRECs to the extent their prices increase. Accordingly, under the proposed rules, a registrant that\npurchases offsets or RECs to meet its goals as it makes the transition to lower carbon products\nwould need to reflect this additional set of short and long-term costs and risks in its Item 1502\ndisclosure, including the risk that the availability or value of offsets or RECs might be curtailed\nby regulation or changes in the market.\n3. Disclosure of a Maintained Internal Carbon Price\nSome registrants may use an internal carbon price when assessing climate-related factors.\nUnder the proposed definition, an internal carbon price is an estimated cost of carbon emissions\nused internally within an organization.239 Internal carbon pricing may be used by a registrant,\namong other purposes, as a planning tool to help identify climate-related risks and opportunities,\nas an incentive to drive energy efficiencies to reduce costs, to quantify the potential costs the\ncompany would incur should a carbon price be put into effect, and to guide capital investment\ndecisions. If a registrant uses an internal carbon price, the proposed rules would require it to\ndisclose:\n239 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(j).\n79\n\n\u2022 The price in units of the registrant\u2019s reporting currency per metric ton of carbon dioxide\nequivalent (\u201cCO e\u201d);240\n2\n\u2022 The total price, including how the total price is estimated to change over time, if\napplicable;\n\u2022 The boundaries for measurement of overall CO e on which the total price is based (if\n2\ndifferent from the GHG emission organizational boundary required pursuant to 17 CFR\n229.1504(e)(2);241 and\n\u2022 The rationale for selecting the internal carbon price applied.242\nThese proposed items of disclosure would help investors understand the rationale and underlying\nassumptions for a registrant\u2019s internal carbon price and help them assess whether the registrant\u2019s\nuse of an internal carbon price as a planning tool is reasonable and effective.\nA registrant would also be required to describe how it uses its disclosed internal carbon\nprice to evaluate and manage climate-related risks.243 If a registrant uses more than one internal\ncarbon price, the proposed rules would require it to provide disclosures for each internal carbon\nprice, and to disclose its reasons for using different prices.244 For example, a registrant might\ndisclose that it uses different internal carbon prices when considering different climate-related\n240 See infra Section II.G for a discussion of our proposal to use CO e as a unit of measurement in the proposed\n2\nrequirements.\n241 See infra Section II.G.2 for a discussion of the proposed requirements for determining the GHG emission\norganizational boundary.\n242 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(e)(1).\n243 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(e)(2).\n244 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(e)(3).\n80\n\nscenarios to help it develop an appropriate business strategy over the short-, medium-, and long-\nterm.245\nCommenters that addressed the topic of carbon price generally supported requiring its\ndisclosure in some form, such as: (i) establishing a broad-based carbon price; (ii) requiring\ncompanies to maintain and disclose an internal carbon price; (iii) requiring disclosure of any\ninternal carbon price already used by a company; or (iv) requiring disclosure of carbon prices\nused in the context of scenario analysis.246 One commenter referred to disclosure of a company\u2019s\nuse of internal carbon pricing as one of several \u201cfoundational climate disclosures\u201d that should be\nrequired in any Commission rule.247 Another commenter also underscored the importance of this\ninformation, stating that \u201cthe thorough quantification of climate risk has been hampered by the\nlack of carbon pricing.\u201d248 We agree with commenters that supported the disclosure of carbon\npricing as a key data point for evaluating how a registrant is planning for and managing climate-\nrelated risks. However, the proposed rules would not require registrants to maintain an internal\ncarbon price or to mandate a particular carbon pricing methodology. We are aware that many\nregistrants may not currently track this information and recognize that a robust carbon market on\nwhich to base such a price may not exist in many contexts.249 Accordingly, the proposed\n245 See infra Section II.C.4 for the proposed disclosure required if a registrant uses scenario analysis.\n246 See, e.g., letters from Rob Bonta, California Attorney General, on behalf of several state attorney generals (June\n14, 2021); Catavento; Center for Climate and Energy Solutions; Ceres; Climate Risk Disclosure Lab; Hermes\nEquity Ownership Services Limited; Majedie Asset Management; Managed Funds Association; Norges Bank\nInvestment Management; Open Source Climate; PRI (Consultation Response); Regenerative Crisis Response\nCommittee; Total Energies (June 13, 2021); and Trillium Asset Management. But see Edison Electric Institute\n(stating that a \u201c\u2018robust carbon market\u2019 does not exist today\u201d and disclosures based on that market would be\n\u201cfraught with risk\u201d).\n247 Letter from Ceres.\n248 Letter from PRI.\n249 See Edison Electric Institute.\n81\n\ndisclosures would be required only if the registrant otherwise maintains an internal carbon price.\nFor similar reasons, we have not proposed requiring a specific methodology for setting an\ninternal carbon price.\nRegistrants may choose to use an internal carbon price when quantifying, analyzing, and\nassessing the financial impacts of climate-related risks and climate-related opportunities. For\nexample, an internal carbon price helps monetize emissions by converting emissions data from\nCO e into a value in the registrant\u2019s reporting currency. A registrant may determine that\n2\nmonetization is useful when assessing the costs and benefits of its possible climate-related\nstrategies, as it effectively puts a price on the emission impacts. Disclosure of an internal carbon\nprice, when used by a registrant, would provide investors with material information regarding\nhow the registrant developed a particular business strategy to mitigate or adapt to identified\nclimate-related risks and would help quantify for investors at least part of the transition risks\nfaced by a registrant. We believe that this proposed disclosure requirement would help investors\nassess whether a registrant\u2019s internal carbon pricing practice is reasonable and whether its overall\nevaluation and planning regarding climate-related factors is sound.250\nA registrant\u2019s disclosure of any internal carbon price necessarily would include\nassumptions about future events. The carbon price applied should not be viewed as a promise or\nguarantee with regard to the future costs to the registrant of GHG emissions. Moreover, to the\nextent that certain information regarding a registrant\u2019s internal carbon pricing would constitute\n250 We also note, based on current voluntary reporting, an increasing trend among public companies to use internal\ncarbon pricing.

Disclosure of Scenario Analysis, if Used\nWe are proposing to require a registrant to describe the resilience of its business strategy\nin light of potential future changes in climate-related risks. A registrant also would be required\nto describe any analytical tools, such as scenario analysis, that the registrant uses to assess the\nimpact of climate-related risks on its business and consolidated financial statements, or to\nsupport the resilience of its strategy and business model in light of foreseeable climate-related\nrisks.251 Scenario analysis is a process for identifying and assessing a potential range of\noutcomes of future events under conditions of uncertainty.252 The proposed definition of\nscenario analysis both states that (i) when applied to climate-related assessments, scenario\nanalysis is a tool used to consider how, under various possible future climate scenarios, climate-\nrelated risks may impact a registrant\u2019s operations, business strategy, and consolidated financial\nstatements over time; and that (ii) registrants might use scenario analysis to test the resilience of\ntheir strategies under future climate scenarios, including scenarios that assume different global\ntemperature increases, such as, for example, 3 \u00b0C, 2 \u00b0C, and 1.5 \u00baC above pre-industrial levels.253\n251 See proposed 17 CFR229.1502(f).\n252 See, e.g., the definition of \u201cscenario analysis\u201d in TCFD, Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related\nFinancial Disclosures.\n253 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(o).\n83\n\nMany commenters recommended that we require a registrant to conduct scenario analysis\nand disclose the results of such analysis.254 One commenter stated that scenario analysis was\nuseful because it allows companies to test their business strategy against a spectrum of\nhypothetical future climate scenarios and develop a better informed view of implications for their\nenterprise value and value chains. The same commenter further indicated that disclosure of the\nscenarios used by a company was necessary to inform investors about the reliability,\nreasonableness, and resiliency of the company\u2019s plans to address climate-related risks and\nopportunities.255\nAnother commenter stated that the Commission should require disclosure of a registrant\u2019s\nclimate scenario analysis by no later than 2025, and recommended that companies engage in\nscenario analysis involving a base case, worse case, better case, and \u201cBlack Swan\u201d scenarios\nrelated to possible climate transition pathways.256 Alternatively, the commenter suggested that a\ncompany take into account three scenarios: a smooth economic transition to +1.5 \u00b0C, which\nwould form the basis of the company\u2019s net-zero strategy; a disorderly and, therefore, more costly\nand disruptive transition to +1.5 \u00b0C; and a higher temperature scenario outcome of +3 \u00b0C of\nwarming, which would be associated with extreme physical effects and unprecedented economic\ncosts and disruption. This commenter further stated that robust disclosure of a company\u2019s\n254 See, e.g., letters from AllianceBernstein; Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund; R.

That commenter stated that the assumptions underlying the selected scenarios often\nare undisclosed and that the analysis tends to be limited and not usefully comparable.258 The\nTCFD\u2019s most recent assessment of public companies\u2019 voluntary climate reporting similarly\nfound that only a small percentage of the surveyed companies disclosed the resilience of their\nstrategies using scenario analysis as recommended by the TCFD.259\nSome commenters recommended providing certain accommodations in connection with a\nscenario analysis requirement, such as creating a safe harbor for scenario analysis disclosure260\nor permitting scenario analysis to be furnished in a separate report that would not be subject to\nthe same liability as Commission filings.261 Other commenters stated that they opposed a\nscenario analysis requirement because of the lack of a common methodology for scenario\nanalysis;262 a belief that the underlying methodology would be too difficult for investors to\n257 See id.\n258 See letter from Ceres. The CDP similarly reported that, although 54% of the 9600+ companies that responded\nto their questionnaires in 2020 reported engaging in scenario analysis, 14% of the companies only considered\none scenario with many others considering only slight variations of one scenario. See CDP, 3 common pitfalls\nof using scenario analysis \u2013 and how to avoid them (Mar. 10, 2021), available at\nhttps://www.cdp.net/en/articles/companies/3-common-pitfalls-companies-make-when-using-scenario-analysis-\nand-how-to-avoid-them.\n259 See TCFD, 2021 Status Report, Section B (indicating that, during 2018-2020, only 5-13% of the surveyed\ncompanies disclosed the resilience of their strategies using scenario analysis).\n260 See letter from J. Robert Gibson.\n261 See letter from NEI Investments.\n262 See letter from Information Technology Industry Council.\n85\n\nunderstand;263 the need for further development of scenario analysis as a discipline;264 or a belief\nthat the focus of climate-related disclosure should be on historical data, and not on forward-\nlooking information.265\nWe agree with those commenters who stated that information concerning scenario\nanalysis could help investors evaluate the resilience of the registrant\u2019s business strategy in the\nface of various climate scenarios that could impose potentially different climate-related risks.\nWe are not, however, proposing to mandate that registrants conduct scenario analysis. We\nrecognize that not every registrant conducts scenario analysis and that, in certain instances, it\nmay be costly or difficult for some registrants to conduct such scenario analysis. Instead, the\nproposed rules would require that if a registrant uses scenario analysis or any analytical tools to\nassess the impact of climate-related risks on its business and consolidated financial statements,\nand to support the resilience of its strategy and business model, the registrant must disclose\ncertain information about such analysis.266 We believe this approach strikes an appropriate\nbalance between the various positions expressed by commenters by requiring registrants to share\nany scenario analysis that they are otherwise conducting for their business operations while\navoiding imposing a potentially difficult or burdensome requirement on those registrants that\nhave not yet undertaken to conduct such analysis.\nIf a registrant uses scenario analysis, the proposed amendments would require disclosure\nof the scenarios considered (e.g., an increase of no greater than 3 \u00ba, 2 \u00ba, or 1.5 \u00baC above pre-\n263 See letter from Dimensional Fund Advisors.\n264 See letter from bp.\n265 See letter from Nareit (June 11, 2021).\n266 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(f). One commenter recommended requiring the disclosure of the results of\nscenario analysis if a registrant has engaged in such analysis. See letter from E3G.\n86\n\nindustrial levels), including parameters, assumptions, and analytical choices, and the projected\nprincipal financial impacts on the registrant\u2019s business strategy under each scenario. The\ndisclosure should include both quantitative and qualitative information. Disclosure of the\nparameters, assumptions, and analytical choices involved in the described scenarios would help\ninvestors better understand the various considered scenarios and help them evaluate whether the\nregistrant has a plan to manage the climate-related risks posed by each scenario.\nBecause a registrant\u2019s scenario analysis disclosure would necessarily include predictions\nand other forward-looking statements based on assumptions concerning future events, we believe\nthat the PSLRA forward-looking safe harbors would apply to much of the disclosure concerning\nscenario analysis provided the other statutory conditions for application of the safe harbor are\nmet.\nWe note that there are a number of publicly-available climate-related scenarios that could\nform the basis of a registrant\u2019s scenario analysis. The TCFD has categorized these scenarios as\ntransition scenarios and physical climate scenarios.267 If a registrant uses scenario analysis to\nassess the resilience of its business strategy to climate-related risks, investors may benefit from\nthe use of scientifically based, widely accepted scenarios, such as those developed by the IPCC,\nInternational Energy Agency (\u201cIEA\u201d),268 or Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for\nGreening the Financial System (\u201cNGFS\u201d).269 Investors may also benefit by the use of more than\n267 See TCFD, Technical Supplement, The Use of Scenario Analysis in Disclosure of Climate-Related Risks and\nOpportunities (June 2017), available at https://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/60/2020/09/2020-\nTCFD_Guidance-Scenario-Analysis-Guidance.pdf.\n268 The TCFD has summarized a number of publicly available scenario analysis models, with particular emphasis\non the transition scenarios developed by the IEA and the physical risk scenarios developed by the IPCC. See id.\nat Appendix 1: IEA and IPCC Climate Scenarios.\n269 See NGFS, Scenarios Portal, available at https://www.ngfs.net/ngfs-scenarios-portal/.\n87\n\none climate scenario, including one that assumes a disorderly transition (i.e., one that assumes\nthat climate policies are delayed or divergent across countries and industrial sectors, resulting in\nhigher transition risks to companies). These could enhance the reliability and usefulness of the\nscenario analysis for investors.\nRequest for Comment\n19. Should we require a registrant to describe the actual and potential impacts of its material\nclimate-related risks on its strategy, business model, and outlook, as proposed? Should we\nrequire a registrant to disclose impacts from climate-related risks on, or any resulting significant\nchanges made to, its business operations, including the types and locations of its operations, as\nproposed?\n20. Should we require a registrant to disclose climate-related impacts on, or any resulting\nsignificant changes made to, its products or services, supply chain or value chain, activities to\nmitigate or adapt to climate-related risks, including adoption of new technologies or processes,\nexpenditure for research and development, and any other significant changes or impacts, as\nproposed? Are there any other aspects of a registrant\u2019s business operations, strategy, or business\nmodel that we should specify as being subject to this disclosure requirement to the extent they\nmay be impacted by climate-related factors?\n21. Should we require a registrant to specify the time horizon applied when assessing its\nclimate-related impacts (i.e., in the short, medium, or long term), as proposed?\n22. Should we require a registrant to discuss whether and how it considers any of the\ndescribed impacts as part of its business strategy, financial planning, and capital allocation, as\nproposed? Should we require a registrant to provide both current and forward-looking\ndisclosures to facilitate an understanding of whether the implications of the identified climate-\n88\n\nrelated risks have been integrated into the registrant\u2019s business model or strategy, as proposed?\nWould any of the proposed disclosures present competitive concerns for registrants? If so, how\ncan we mitigate such concerns?\n23. Should we require the disclosures to include how the registrant is using resources to\nmitigate climate-related risks, as proposed? Should the required discussion also include how any\nof the metrics or targets referenced in the proposed climate-related disclosure subpart of\nRegulation S-K or Article 14 of Regulation S-X relate to the registrant\u2019s business model or\nbusiness strategy, as proposed? Should we require additional disclosures if a registrant leverages\nclimate-related financing instruments, such as green bonds or other forms of \u201csustainable\nfinance\u201d such as \u201csustainability-linked bonds,\u201d \u201ctransition bonds,\u201d or other financial instruments\nlinked to climate change as part of its strategy to address climate-related risks and opportunities?\nFor example, should we require disclosure of the climate-related projects that the registrant plans\nto use the green bond proceeds to fund? Should we require disclosure of key performance\nmetrics tied to such financing instruments?\n24. If a registrant has used carbon offsets or RECs, should we require the registrant to\ndisclose the role that the offsets or RECs play in its overall strategy to reduce its net carbon\nemissions, as proposed? Should the proposed definitions of carbon offsets and RECs be clarified\nor expanded in any way? Are there specific considerations about the use of carbon offsets or\nRECs that we should require to be disclosed in a registrant\u2019s discussion regarding how climate-\nrelated factors have impacted its strategy, business model, and outlook?\n25. Should we require a registrant to provide a narrative discussion of whether and how any\nof its identified climate-related risks have affected or are reasonably likely to affect its\nconsolidated financial statements, as proposed? Should the discussion include any of the\n89\n\nfinancial statement metrics in proposed 17 CFR 210.14-02 (14-02 of Regulation S-X) that\ndemonstrate that the identified climate-related risks have had a material impact on reported\noperations, as proposed? Should the discussion include a tabular representation of such metrics?\n26. Should we require registrants to disclose information about an internal carbon price if\nthey maintain one, as proposed? If so, should we require that the registrant disclose:\n\u2022 The price in units of the registrant\u2019s reporting currency per metric ton of CO e;\n2\n\u2022 The total price;\n\u2022 The boundaries for measurement of overall CO e on which the total price is based if\n2\ndifferent from the GHG emission organizational boundary required pursuant to 17 CFR\n210.14-03(d)(4); and\n\u2022 The rationale for selecting the internal or shadow carbon price applied, as proposed?\nShould we also require registrants to describe the methodology used to calculate its internal\ncarbon price?\n27. Should we also require a registrant to disclose how it uses the described internal carbon\nprice to evaluate and manage climate-related risks, as proposed? Should we further require a\nregistrant that uses more than one internal carbon price to provide the above disclosures for each\ninternal carbon price, and disclose its reasons for using different prices, as proposed? Are there\nother aspects regarding the use of an internal carbon price that we should require to be disclosed?\nWould disclosure regarding any internal carbon price maintained by a registrant elicit important\nor material information for investors? Would requiring the disclosure of the registrant\u2019s use of\nan internal carbon price raise competitive harm concerns that would act as a disincentive from\nthe use of an internal carbon price? If so, should the Commission provide an accommodation\n90\n\nthat would mitigate those concerns? For example, are there exceptions or exemptions to an\ninternal carbon price disclosure requirement that we should consider?\n28. To the extent that disclosure that incorporates or is based on an internal carbon price\nconstitutes forward-looking information, the PSLRA safe harbors would apply. Should we adopt\na separate safe harbor for internal carbon price disclosure? If so, what disclosures should such a\nsafe harbor cover and what should the conditions be for such a safe harbor?\n29. Should we require all registrants to disclose an internal carbon price and prescribe a\nmethodology for determining that price? If so, what corresponding disclosure requirements\nshould we include in connection with such mandated carbon price? What methodology, if any,\nshould we prescribe for calculating a mandatory internal or shadow carbon price? Would a\ndifferent metric better elicit disclosure that would monetize emissions?\n30. Should we require a registrant to disclose analytical tools, such as scenario analysis, that\nit uses to assess the impact of climate-related risks on its business and consolidated financial\nstatements, and to support the resilience of its strategy and business model, as proposed? What\nother analytical tools do registrants use for these purposes, and should we require disclosure of\nthese other tools? Are there other situations in which some registrants should be required to\nconduct and provide disclosure of scenario analysis? Alternatively, should we require all\nregistrants to provide scenario analysis disclosure? If a registrant does provide scenario analysis\ndisclosure, should we require it to follow certain publicly available scenario models, such as\nthose published by the IPCC, the IEA, or NGFS and, if so, which scenarios? Should we require\na registrant providing scenario analysis disclosure to include the scenarios considered (e.g., an\nincrease of global temperature of no greater than 3 \u00ba, 2 \u00ba, or 1.5 \u00baC above pre-industrial levels),\nthe parameters, assumptions, and analytical choices, and the projected principal financial impacts\n91\n\non the registrant\u2019s business strategy under each scenario, as proposed? Are there any other\naspects of scenario analysis that we should require registrants to disclose? For example, should\nwe require a registrant using scenario analysis to consider a scenario that assumes a disorderly\ntransition? Is there a need for us to provide additional guidance regarding scenario analysis?\nAre there any aspects of scenario analysis in our proposed required disclosure that we should\nexclude?

Board Oversight\nThe proposed rules would require a registrant to disclose a number of board governance\nitems, as applicable. The first item would require a registrant to identify any board members or\nboard committees responsible for the oversight of climate-related risks.276 The responsible board\ncommittee might be an existing committee, such as the audit committee or risk committee, or a\nseparate committee established to focus on climate-related risks. The next proposed item would\nrequire disclosure of whether any member of a registrant\u2019s board of directors has expertise in\nclimate-related risks, with disclosure required in sufficient detail to fully describe the nature of\nthe expertise.277\n273 See, e.g., letters from Bloomberg, LP; and Natural Resources Defense Council.\n274 See TCFD, 2021 Status Report (Oct. 2021) (finding that 9% of surveyed companies provided TCFD-\nrecommended board disclosure in 2018, which increased to 25% in 2020; and 9% provided TCFD-\nrecommended management disclosure in 2018, which increased to 18% in 2020).\n275 See, e.g., 17 CFR 229.401 and 229.407.\n276 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1501(a)(1)(i).\n277 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1501(a)(1)(ii).\n94\n\nAnother proposed item would require a description of the processes and frequency by\nwhich the board or board committee discusses climate-related risks.278 The registrant would\nhave to disclose how the board is informed about climate-related risks, and how frequently the\nboard considers such risks. These proposed disclosure items could provide investors with insight\ninto how a registrant\u2019s board considers climate-related risks and any relevant qualifications of\nboard members.279\nThe proposed rule also would require disclosure about whether and how the board or\nboard committee considers climate-related risks as part of its business strategy, risk management,\nand financial oversight.280 This disclosure could enable an investor to understand whether and\nhow the board or board committee considers climate-related risks when reviewing and guiding\nbusiness strategy and major plans of action, when setting and monitoring implementation of risk\nmanagement policies and performance objectives, when reviewing and approving annual\nbudgets, and when overseeing major expenditures, acquisitions, and divestitures. In this way, the\nproposed disclosure requirement could help investors assess the degree to which a board\u2019s\nconsideration of climate-related risks has been integrated into a registrant\u2019s strategic business\nand financial planning and its overall level of preparation to maintain its shareholder value.\nFinally, the proposed rule would require disclosure about whether and how the board sets\nclimate-related targets or goals and how it oversees progress against those targets or goals,\nincluding the establishment of any interim targets or goals.281 Such a target might be, for\n278 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1501(a)(1)(iii).\n279 See, e.g., letters from Bloomberg, LP; NY State Comptroller; and Vanguard Group, Inc.\n280 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1501(a)(1)(iv).\n281 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1501(a)(1)(v).\n95"

Management Oversight\nSimilar to the proposed required disclosures on board oversight, the proposed rules would\nrequire a registrant to disclose a number of items, as applicable, about management\u2019s role in\nassessing and managing any climate-related risks. For example, a registrant would be required to\ndisclose, as applicable, whether certain management positions or committees are responsible for\nassessing and managing climate-related risks and, if so, to identify such positions or committees\nand disclose the relevant expertise of the position holders or members in such detail as necessary\nto fully describe the nature of the expertise.282 This proposed requirement would give investors\nadditional information to assess the extent to which management addresses climate-related risks,\nwhich could help them to make better informed investment or voting decisions.\nSimilar to the proposed board oversight provision described above, another proposed\nitem would require disclosure about the processes by which the responsible managers or\nmanagement committees are informed about and monitor climate-related risks.283 Such a\ndiscussion might include, for example, whether there are specific positions or committees\n282 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1501(b)(1)(i).\n283 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1501(b)(1)(ii).\n96\n\nresponsible for monitoring and assessing specific climate-related risks, the extent to which\nmanagement relies on in-house staff with the relevant expertise to evaluate climate-related risks\nand implement related plans of action, and the extent to which management relies on third-party\nclimate consultants for these same purposes.\nThe final proposed management governance item would require disclosure about whether\nthe responsible positions or committees report to the board or board committee on climate-\nrelated risks and how frequently this occurs.284 These proposed disclosure items could help\ninvestors evaluate whether management has adequately implemented processes to identify,\nassess, and manage climate-related risks. If applicable, a registrant may elect also to describe\nmanagement\u2019s role in assessing and managing climate-related opportunities.\nSeveral commenters recommended that we require a registrant to disclose whether it has\nconnected a portion of its executive remuneration with the achievement of climate-related targets\nor goals.285 Other commenters expressed the view that such a requirement is unnecessary,\nbecause a registrant could implement other measures to motivate progress towards climate-\nrelated targets286 or connect executive remuneration with climate-related achievements as a\ndiscretionary matter for the registrant.287 We are not proposing a compensation-related\ndisclosure requirement at this time, because we believe that our existing rules requiring a\ncompensation discussion and analysis should already provide a framework for disclosure of any\n284 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1501(b)(1)(iii).\n285 See, e.g., letters from Baillie Gifford; Andrew Behar; CDP; Climate Governance Initiative; E3G (June 14,\n2021); Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility; Majedie Asset Management; NEI Investments; NY State\nComptroller; PRI (Consultation Response); RMI (June 11, 2021); Maria Stoica; and Value Balancing Alliance.\n286 See letter from Richard Love.\n287 See letter from Western Energy Alliance (June 12, 2021).\n97\n\nconnection between executive remuneration and achieving progress in addressing climate-related\nrisks.288\nRequest for Comment\n34.

Disclosure of Processes for Identifying, Assessing, and Managing Climate-\nRelated Risks\nThe proposed rules would require a registrant to describe any processes the registrant has\nfor identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks.289 Risk disclosure is a long-\nstanding disclosure concept under our regulations.290 Several commenters recommended that we\nadopt decision-useful disclosure requirements concerning a registrant\u2019s climate-related risk\nmanagement practices.291 More granular information regarding any climate-related risk\nmanagement could allow investors to better understand how a registrant identifies, evaluates, and\naddresses climate-related risks that may materially impact its business. Such information could\nalso permit investors to ascertain whether a registrant has made the assessment of climate-related\n289 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1503(a).\n290 Risk factor disclosure has been part of the Commission\u2019s Securities Act disclosure requirements since prior to\nand from adoption of its integrated disclosure system. See Release No. 33-6383, Adoption of Integrated\nDisclosure System (Mar. 3, 1982). The Commission added risk factor disclosure to its Exchange Act\nregistration and annual reporting requirements in 2005. See Release No. 33-8591, Securities Offering Reform\n(July 19, 2005) [70 FR 44722 (Aug. 3, 2005)].\n291 See, e.g., letters from Rob Bonta, California Attorney General et al.; Boston Common Asset Management;\nCarbon Tracker Initiative; Confluence Philanthropy; Hermes Equity Ownership Services Ltd.; The Institute for\nPolicy Integrity (\u201cPolicy Integrity\u201d) at New York University School of Law, Environmental Defense Fund\n(\u201cEDF\u201d), the Initiative on Climate Risk and Resilience Law (\u201cICRRL\u201d), and Professors Madison Condon, Jim\nRossi, and Michael Vandenbergh (June 14, 2021) (\u201cInstitute for Policy Integrity, Environmental Defense Fund,\nInitiative on Climate Risk & Resilience Law\u201d); and Total Energies.\n100\n\nrisks part of its regular risk management processes. Despite the importance of climate-related\nrisk management information, only a minority of registrants currently include such information\nin their voluntary climate reports.292\nWhen describing the processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks, the\nregistrant would be required to disclose, as applicable:\n\u2022 How it determines the relative significance of climate-related risks compared to other\nrisks;\n\u2022 How it considers existing or likely regulatory requirements or policies, such as GHG\nemissions limits, when identifying climate-related risks;\n\u2022 How it considers shifts in customer or counterparty preferences, technological changes,\nor changes in market prices in assessing potential transition risks; and\n\u2022 How it determines the materiality of climate-related risks, including how it assesses the\npotential size and scope of any identified climate-related risk.293\nWhen describing any processes for managing climate-related risks, a registrant would be\nrequired to disclose, as applicable:\n\u2022 How it decides whether to mitigate, accept, or adapt to a particular risk;\n\u2022 How it prioritizes addressing climate-related risks; and\n\u2022 How it determines how to mitigate a high priority risk.294\n292 See TCFD, 2021 Status Report, Section B (indicating that, during 2018-2020, 16-30% of surveyed public\ncompanies disclosed their climate risk identification and assessment processes, 14-29% disclosed their risk\nmanagement processes, and 10-27% disclosed whether their climate risk management processes were integrated\ninto their overall risk management).\n293 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1503(a)(1).\n294 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1503(a)(2).\n101"

As part of this risk\nmanagement description, if a registrant uses insurance or other financial products to manage its\nexposure to climate-related risks, it may need to describe its use of these products.295\nThe proposed rules would also require a registrant to disclose whether and how climate-\nrelated risks are integrated into the registrant\u2019s overall risk management system or processes.296\nIf a separate board or management committee is responsible for assessing and managing climate-\nrelated risks, a registrant would be required to disclose how that committee interacts with the\nregistrant\u2019s board or management committee governing risks.297 These proposed disclosures\nwould help investors assess whether the registrant has centralized the processes for managing\nclimate-related risks, which may indicate to investors how the board and management may\nrespond to such risks as they unfold.\n2. Transition Plan Disclosure\nAdoption of a transition plan to mitigate or adapt to climate-related risks may be an\nimportant part of a registrant\u2019s climate-related risk management strategy, particularly if it\noperates in a jurisdiction that has made commitments under the Paris Agreement to reduce its\nGHG emissions.

If a registrant has adopted a transition plan, the proposed rules would require it to\ndescribe its plan, including the relevant metrics and targets used to identify and manage physical\nand transition risks.301 This information could help investors understand how a registrant intends\nto address identified climate-related risks and any transition to a lower carbon economy while\nmanaging and assessing its business operations and financial condition. Because transition\nplanning inherently requires judgments and predictions about the future, forward-looking\nstatements made as part of a registrant\u2019s discussion of its transition plan would be eligible for the\nPSLRA forward-looking statement safe harbors provided all applicable conditions are met.302\nIf a registrant has adopted a transition plan as part of its climate-related risk management\nstrategy, the proposed rules would require the registrant to discuss, as applicable, how it plans to\n298 See, e.g., letters from As You Sow; BlackRock; Clean Yield Asset Management; Climate Advisers; Climate\nGovernance Initiative; Fiends of the Earth et al; Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development;\nMiller/Howard Investments; Trillium Asset Management; and World Benchmarking Alliance.\n299 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(s).\n300 See id.\n301 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1503(c)(1).\n302 See supra note 219.\n103\n\nmitigate or adapt to any physical risks identified in the filing, including but not limited to those\nconcerning exposure to sea level rise, extreme weather events, wildfires, drought, and severe\nheat.303 For example, a company with significant operations in areas vulnerable to sea level rise\nmight plan to relocate its vulnerable operations as part of any transition plan. A company\noperating in areas subject to severe storms might have a transition plan that includes reinforcing\nits physical facilities to better withstand such weather events, or a plan to relocate those facilities.\nAn agricultural producer that operates in areas subject to increasing water stress might discuss its\nplans to adjust its business strategy or operations, for example by developing or switching to\ndrought-resistant crops, developing technologies to optimize the use of available water, or\nacquiring land in other areas.304\nThe proposed rules would also require a registrant that has adopted a transition plan as\npart of its climate-related risk management strategy to discuss, as applicable, how it plans to\nmitigate or adapt to any identified transition risks, including the following:\n\u2022 Laws, regulations, or policies that:\no Restrict GHG emissions or products with high GHG footprints, including emissions\ncaps;305 or\no Require the protection of high conservation value land or natural assets;306\n303 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1503(c)(2)(i).\n304 A registrant would be required to disclose the expected impact of any potential reduction on its results of\noperations or financial condition pursuant to proposed 17 CFR 229.1502 to the extent it believes the likely\nimpact would be material. Such quantified disclosure may be eligible for the PSLRA safe harbors if the\nconditions of the safe harbors are met.\n305 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1503(c)(2)(ii)(A)(1).\n306 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1503(c)(2)(ii)(A)(2).\n104\n\n\u2022 Imposition of a carbon price;307 and\n\u2022 Changing demands or preferences of consumers, investors, employees, and business\ncounterparties.308\nWhile each of these transition risks may not be applicable to each registrant and its\nparticular transition plan, the above examples are intended to guide registrants in providing\nmeaningful disclosure about its risk management strategies that is not generic or boilerplate. In\nthis regard, it is important for investors to understand how a registrant plans to mitigate or adapt\nto any identified transition risks in its transition plan given the potential associated costs and\nburdens and their impact on the registrant\u2019s business.\nThe proposed rules would require a registrant that has adopted a transition plan as part of\nits climate-related management strategy to update its disclosure about its transition plan each\nfiscal year by describing the actions taken during the year to achieve the plan\u2019s targets or\ngoals.309 This is intended to provide investors with information that can help them better\nunderstand the registrant\u2019s effectiveness in implementing any transition plan and the potential\nrisks and costs associated with what it still needs to accomplish.\nA registrant that has adopted a transition plan as part of its climate-related risk\nmanagement strategy may also describe how it plans to achieve any identified climate-related\nopportunities, such as:\n\u2022 The production of products that facilitate the transition to a lower carbon economy, such\nas low emission modes of transportation and supporting infrastructure;\n307 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1503(c)(2)(ii)(B).\n308 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1503(c)(2)(ii)(C).\n309 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1503(c)(1).\n105\n\n\u2022 The generation or use of renewable power;\n\u2022 The production or use of low waste, recycled, or other consumer products that require\nless carbon intensive production methods;\n\u2022 The setting of conservation goals and targets that would help reduce GHG emissions; and\n\u2022 The provision of goods or services related to any transition to a lower carbon economy.310\nFor example, an energy company might discuss how, due to actual or potential regulatory\nconstraints, it intends to take advantage of climate-related opportunities by increasing the amount\nof electricity purchased that is produced using renewable energy sources, reducing its medium\nand long-range fossil fuel exploration and production, increasing the percentage of its products\nconsisting of biofuels and other lower emissions fuels, or investing in carbon capture and storage\ntechnologies. A transportation company might discuss how, to mitigate reputational risk, it plans\nto realize any climate-related opportunities presented by switching its existing fleet to one\ncomposed of low- or no-emission vehicles by a certain date.311\nRequest for Comment\n42. Should we require a registrant to describe its processes for identifying, assessing, and\nmanaging climate-related risks, as proposed?\n43. When describing the processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks, should\nwe require a registrant to disclose, as applicable, as proposed:\n\u2022 How the registrant determines the relative significance of climate-related risks compared\nto other risks?\n310 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1503(c)(3)(i) through (v).\n311 A registrant would be required to disclose the expected impact of any transition opportunity on its results of\noperations or financial condition, e.g., increased costs or expenditures, pursuant to proposed 17 CFR 229.1502\nto the extent it believes they would be reasonably likely to have a material impact.\n106\n\n\u2022 How it considers existing or likely regulatory requirements or policies, such as emissions\nlimits, when identifying climate-related risks?\n\u2022 How it considers shifts in customer or counterparty preferences, technological changes,\nor changes in market prices in assessing potential transition risks?\n\u2022 How the registrant determines the materiality of climate-related risks, including how it\nassesses the potential size and scope of an identified climate-related risk?\nAre there other items relevant to a registrant\u2019s identification and assessment of climate-related\nrisks that we should require it to disclose instead of or in addition to the proposed disclosure\nitems?\n44. When describing the processes for managing climate-related risks, should we require a\nregistrant to disclose, as applicable, as proposed:\n\u2022 How it decides whether to mitigate, accept, or adapt to a particular risk?\n\u2022 How it prioritizes climate-related risks?\n\u2022 How it determines to mitigate a high priority risk?\nAre there other items relevant to a registrant\u2019s management of climate-related risks that\nwe should require it to disclose instead of or in addition to the proposed disclosure items?\n45. Should we require a registrant to disclose whether and how the processes described in\nresponse to proposed 17 CFR 229.1503(a) are integrated into the registrant\u2019s overall risk\nmanagement system or processes, as proposed? Should we specify any particular aspect of this\narrangement that a registrant should disclose, such as any interaction between, and corresponding\nroles of, the board or any management committee responsible for assessing climate-related risks,\nif there is a separate and distinct committee of the board or management, and the registrant\u2019s\ncommittee in charge, generally, of risk assessment and management?\n107\n\n46.

Would this proposed disclosure requirement raise any competitive\nharm concerns and, if so, how can we mitigate such concerns? Would any of the proposed\ndisclosure requirements for a registrant\u2019s transition plan act as a disincentive to the adoption of\nsuch a plan by the registrant?\n47. If a registrant has adopted a transition plan, should we require it, when describing the\nplan, to disclose, as applicable, how the registrant plans to mitigate or adapt to any identified\nphysical risks, including but not limited to those concerning energy, land, or water use and\nmanagement, as proposed? Are there any other aspects or considerations related to the\nmitigation or adaption to physical risks that we should specifically require to be disclosed in the\ndescription of a registrant\u2019s transition plan?\n48. If a registrant has adopted a transition plan, should we require it to disclose, if applicable,\nhow it plans to mitigate or adapt to any identified transition risks, including the following, as\nproposed:\n\u2022 Laws, regulations, or policies that:\no Restrict GHG emissions or products with high GHG footprints, including emissions\ncaps; or\no Require the protection of high conservation value land or natural assets?\n\u2022 Imposition of a carbon price?\n\u2022 Changing demands or preferences of consumers, investors, employees, and business\ncounterparts?\n108\n\nAre there any other transition risks that we should specifically identify for disclosure, if\napplicable, in the transition plan description? Are there any identified transition risks that we\nshould exclude from the plan description?\n49. If a registrant has adopted a transition plan, when describing the plan, should we permit\nthe registrant also to discuss how it plans to achieve any identified climate-related opportunities,\nincluding, as proposed:\n\u2022 The production of products that facilitate the transition to a lower carbon economy, such\nas low emission modes of transportation and supporting infrastructure?\n\u2022 The generation or use of renewable power?\n\u2022 The production or use of low waste, recycled, or environmentally friendly consumer\nproducts that require less carbon intensive production methods?\n\u2022 The setting of conservation goals and targets that would help reduce GHG emissions?\n\u2022 The provision of services related to any transition to a lower carbon economy?\nShould we require a registrant to discuss how it plans to achieve any of the above, or any other,\nclimate-related opportunities when describing its transition plan?\n50. If a registrant has disclosed its transition plan in a Commission filing, should we require\nit to update its transition plan disclosure each fiscal year by describing the actions taken during\nthe year to achieve the plan\u2019s targets or goals, as proposed? Should we require a registrant to\nprovide such an update more frequently, and if so, how frequently? Would the proposed\nupdating requirement act as a disincentive to the adoption of a transition plan by the registrant?\n51. To the extent that disclosure about a registrant\u2019s transition plan constitutes forward-\nlooking information, the PSLRA safe harbors would apply. Should we adopt a separate safe\n109"

Financial Statement Metrics\n1. Overview\nIf a registrant is required to file the disclosure required by subpart 229.1500 in a form that\nalso requires audited financial statements,312 under our proposal it would be required to disclose\nin a note to its financial statements certain disaggregated climate-related financial statement\nmetrics that are mainly derived from existing financial statement line items.313 In particular, the\nproposed rules would require disclosure falling under the following three categories of\ninformation:\n\u2022 Financial Impact Metrics;\n\u2022 Expenditure Metrics; and\n\u2022 Financial Estimates and Assumptions.\nThe proposed financial statement metrics disclosures would involve estimation\nuncertainties that are driven by the application of judgments and assumptions, similar to other\nfinancial statement disclosures (e.g., estimated loss contingencies, fair value measurement of\ncertain assets, etc.). Accordingly, for each type of financial statement metric, the proposed rules\nwould require the registrant to disclose contextual information to enable a reader to understand\n312 For example, the climate-related note to the financial statements would not be required in a Form 10-Q filing.\nSee proposed 17 CFR 210.14-01(a). See infra note 690 and accompanying text, which discusses the\napplicability of the proposed rules to foreign private issuers.\n313 See FASB Concepts Statement No. 8, Chapter 8, par. D8 (\u201c[T]he primary purpose of notes to financial\nstatements is to supplement or further explain the information on the face of financial statements by providing\nfinancial information relevant to existing and potential investors, lenders, and other creditors for making\ndecisions about providing resources to an entity.\u201d).\n110\n\nhow it derived the metric, including a description of significant inputs and assumptions used, and\nif applicable, policy decisions made by the registrant to calculate the specified metrics.314\nA number of existing accounting standards could elicit climate-related disclosure in the\nfinancial statements, as highlighted by the FASB in a Staff Educational Paper and by the IFRS in\na similar document.315 Nevertheless, we believe the proposed rules would benefit registrants by\nspecifying when to provide such disclosures. Furthermore, the proposed rules may increase the\nconsistency and comparability of such disclosures by prescribing accounting principles for\npreparing the proposed climate-related financial statement metrics disclosures, including, among\nother things, provisions that would specify the basis of calculation for such metrics and their\npresentation.316\nTo avoid potential confusion, maintain consistency with the rest of the financial\nstatements, and aid comparability, registrants would be required to calculate the proposed\n314 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-02(a). Inputs and assumptions may include the estimation methodology used to\ndisaggregate the amount of impact on the financial statements between the climate-related events and activities\nand other factors. Policy decisions referenced herein may include a registrant\u2019s election to disclose the impacts\nfrom climate-related opportunities. See also infra Section II.F.2 for an example of contextual information that\nwould be required.\n315 See FASB Staff Educational Paper, Intersection of Environmental, Social, and Governance Matters with\nFinancial Accounting Standards (Mar. 2021), available at\nhttps://fasb.org/jsp/FASB/Document_C/DocumentPage&cid=1176176379917. See also IFRS, Effects of\nclimate-related matters on financial statements (Nov. 2020), available at\nhttps://www.ifrs.org/content/dam/ifrs/supporting-implementation/documents/effects-of-climate-related-matters-\non-financial-statements.pdf#:~:text=IFRS%20Standards%20do%20not%20refer%\n20explicitly%20to%20climate-related,significant%20judgements%20and%20estimates%20that%20\nmanagement%20has%20made.\n316 The Commission has broad authority to set accounting standards and principles. See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. 77s; 15\nU.S.C. 7218(c); and Policy Statement: Reaffirming the Status of the FASB as a Designated Private-Sector\nStandard Setter, Release No. 33-8221 (Apr. 25, 2003) [68 FR 23333 (May 1, 2003)], at 23334 (\u201cWhile the\nCommission consistently has looked to the private sector in the past to set accounting standards, the securities\nlaws, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, clearly provide the Commission with authority to set accounting\nstandards for public companies and other entities that file financial statements with the Commission.\u201d). See\nalso FASB Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cFASB ASC\u201d) Topic 105-10-10-1 (\u201cRules and interpretive\nreleases of the Securities and Exchange Commission . . . are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC\nregistrants.\u201d).\n111\n\nfinancial statement metrics using financial information that is consistent with the scope of the\nrest of the registrant\u2019s consolidated financial statements included in the filing.317 Therefore,\nregistrants would have to include in any such calculation financial information from consolidated\nsubsidiaries.318\nFor the avoidance of doubt, and to further promote consistency in the preparation of the\nfinancial statements, the proposed basis of calculation requirements would also specify that a\nregistrant would be required to apply the same set of accounting principles that it is required to\napply in preparation of the rest of its consolidated financial statements included in the filing,\nwhenever applicable.319 Although 17 CFR 210.4-01(a)(1) already states that financial statements\nfiled with the Commission that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP will be presumed\nmisleading or inaccurate unless the Commission has otherwise provided, clarifying the\napplication of this concept in the proposed rules may be helpful, given the possible confusion\nthat may arise between the current body of GAAP and the proposed requirements.320\nThe proposed rules would also require disclosure to be provided for the registrant\u2019s most\nrecently completed fiscal year and for the historical fiscal year(s) included in the registrant\u2019s\n317 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-01(c)(1).\n318 See, e.g., 17 CFR 210.3-01(a) (\u201cThere shall be filed, for the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated, audited\nbalance sheets as of the end of each of the two most recent fiscal years.\u201d).\n319 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-01(c)(2). Foreign private issuers that file consolidated financial statements under\nhome country GAAP and reconcile to U.S. GAAP, would be required to use U.S. GAAP (including the\nprovisions of the proposed rules) as the basis for calculating and disclosing the proposed climate-related\nfinancial statement metrics. Foreign private issuers that file consolidated financial statements under IFRS as\nissued by the IASB, would apply IFRS and the proposed rules as the basis for calculating and disclosing the\nproposed climate-related financial statement metrics. For simplicity, we do not refer to the corresponding IFRS\nin each instance where we refer to a FASB ASC. Accordingly, references in this release to a FASB ASC should\nbe read to also refer to the corresponding IFRS for foreign private issuers applying those standards. See also\ninfra note 690 which discusses proposed amendments to Form 20-F.\n320 See also 17 CFR 210.4-01(a)(2) (discussing the application of U.S. GAAP, IFRS, and the use of other\ncomprehensive sets of accounting principles (with reconciliation to U.S. GAAP)).\n112\n\nconsolidated financial statements in the applicable filing.321 For example, a registrant that is\nrequired to include balance sheets as of the end of its two most recent fiscal years and income\nstatements and cash flow statements at the end of its three most recent fiscal years would be\nrequired to disclose two years of the climate-related financial statement metrics that correspond\nto balance sheet line items and three years of the climate-related financial statement metrics that\ncorrespond to income statement or cash flow statement line items. If the registrant is an\nemerging growth company (\u201cEGC\u201d)322 or SRC, only two years would be required.323\nA registrant, however, would not need to provide a corresponding historical metric for a\nfiscal year preceding its current reporting fiscal year if it is eligible to take advantage of the\naccommodation in 17 CFR 230.409 (\u201cRule 409\u201d) or 17 CFR 240.12b-21 (\u201cRule 12b-21\u201d). For\nexample, if a registrant has not previously presented such metric for such fiscal year and the\nhistorical information necessary to calculate or estimate such metric is not reasonably available\nto the registrant without unreasonable effort or expense, the registrant may be able to rely on\nRule 409 or Rule 12b-21 to exclude a corresponding historical metric. Requiring disclosure of\ncurrent and, when known or reasonably available, historical periods, should allow investors to\nanalyze trends in the climate-related impacts on the consolidated financial statements and to\n321 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-01(d).\n322 An EGC is a registrant that had total annual gross revenues of less than $1.07 billion during its most recently\ncompleted fiscal year and has not met the specified conditions for no longer being considered an EGC. See 17\nCFR 230.405; 17 CFR 240.12b-2; 15 U.S.C. 77b(a)(19); 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(80); and Inflation Adjustments and\nOther Technical Amendments under Titles I and III of the JOBS Act, Release No. 33- 10332 (Mar. 31, 2017) [82\nFR 17545 (Apr. 12, 2017)].\n323 An EGC is only required to provide audited statements of comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the\ntwo fiscal years preceding the date of the most recent audited balance sheet (or such shorter period as the\nregistrant has been in existence). See 17 CFR 210.3-02(a). A similar accommodation is provided to SRCs. See\n17 CFR 210.8-02.\n113\n\nbetter evaluate the narrative trend disclosure provided pursuant to proposed Subpart 1500 of\nRegulation S-K.324\nRequest for Comment\n52. Should we require a registrant to provide contextual information, including a description\nof significant inputs and assumptions used, and if applicable, policy decisions made by the\nregistrant to calculate the specified metrics, as proposed? Should we revise the proposed\nrequirement to provide contextual information to require specific information instead? We\nprovide some examples of contextual information disclosure in Sections II.F.2 and II.F.3 below.\nWould providing additional examples or guidance assist registrants in preparing this disclosure?\n53. The proposed rules would specify the basis of calculation for the climate-related financial\nstatement metrics. Is it clear how to apply these accounting principles when calculating the\nproposed climate-related financial statement metrics, or should we provide additional guidance?\nShould we require a registrant to report these metrics with reference to its consolidated financial\nstatements, as proposed? If not, how should registrants report these metrics? If we were to\nestablish accounting principles (e.g., the basis for reporting these metrics) in a manner that\ndiffers from the principles applicable to the rest of the consolidated financial statements, would\nthe application of those principles to the proposed metrics make climate-related disclosures less\nclear, helpful, or comparable for investors?\n54. Should we also require such metrics to be calculated at a reportable segment level when a\nregistrant has more than one reportable segment (as defined by the FASB ASC Topic 280\nSegment Reporting)? In addition, should we require such metrics to be presented by geographic\n324 See supra Section II.C.\n114\n\nareas that are consistent with the registrant\u2019s reporting pursuant to FASB ASC Topic 280-10-50-\n41? How would investors use such information?\n55. The proposed rules would require disclosure for the registrant\u2019s most recently completed\nfiscal year and for the corresponding historical fiscal years included in the registrant\u2019s\nconsolidated financial statements in the filing. Should disclosure of the climate-related financial\nstatement metrics be required for the fiscal years presented in the registrant\u2019s financial\nstatements, as proposed? Instead, should we require the financial statement metrics to be\ncalculated only for the most recently completed fiscal year presented in the relevant filing?\nWould requiring historical disclosure provide important or material information to investors,\nsuch as information allowing them to analyze trends? Are there other approaches we should\nconsider?\n56. Should information for all periods in the consolidated financial statements be required for\nregistrants that are filing an initial registration statement or providing climate-related financial\nstatement metrics disclosure for historical periods prior to the effective date or compliance date\nof the rules? Would the existing accommodation in Rules 409 and 12b-21 be sufficient to\naddress any potential difficulties in providing the proposed disclosures in such situations?\n57. Should we provide additional guidance as to when a registrant may exclude a historical\nmetric for a fiscal year preceding the current fiscal year?\n58. In several instances, the proposed rules specifically point to existing GAAP and, in this\nrelease, we provide guidance with respect to the application of existing GAAP. Are there other\nexisting GAAP requirements that we should reference? Are there instances where it would be\npreferable to require an approach based on TCFD guidance or some other framework, rather than\nrequiring the application of existing GAAP?\n115"

Financial Impact Metrics\nAs discussed above, proposed Item 1502(d) of Regulation S-K would require a registrant\nto provide a narrative discussion of whether and how any of its identified climate-related risks\nhave affected or are reasonably likely to affect the registrant\u2019s consolidated financial\nstatements.325 The term \u201cclimate-related risks\u201d would be defined, in part, as the actual or\npotential negative impacts of climate-related conditions and events on a registrant\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial statements.326 \u201cClimate-related risks\u201d would also be defined to include physical risks,\nsuch as extreme weather events, and transition risks.327 To complement this proposed\nrequirement in Regulation S-K to provide narrative disclosure about impacts on a registrant\u2019s\nconsolidated financial statements, we are proposing to amend Regulation S-X to require a\nregistrant to include disaggregated information about the impact of climate-related conditions\nand events, and transition activities, on the consolidated financial statements included in the\nrelevant filing,328 unless such impact is below a specified threshold.\nWe are proposing to require disclosure of the impacts from severe weather events and\nother natural conditions and transition activities, which should capture a broad spectrum of these\ntwo types of climate-related risks (physical risks and transition risks). In addition, the proposed\nrules would require disclosure of the impacts of any climate-related risks identified pursuant to\nproposed Item 1502(a)\u2014both physical risks (\u201cidentified physical risks\u201d) and transition risks\n325 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(d).\n326 See supra Section II.B.1 (discussing the definition of \u201cclimate-related risks\u201d).\n327 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(c) (defining \u201cclimate related risks\u201d to include \u201cphysical risks\u201d and \u201ctransition\nrisks\u201d).\n328 For example, the impact on the income statement line items for the periods presented in the financial statements\nin a registrant\u2019s Form 10-K.\n116\n\n(\u201cidentified transition risks\u201d)\u2014on any of the financial statement metrics.329 Among the\nexamples of severe weather events and other natural conditions that we have highlighted in the\nproposed rule are those that the Commission identified more than a decade ago in the 2010\nGuidance as potentially affecting a registrant\u2019s operations and results.330 In addition, although\nnot specifically mentioned in the 2010 Guidance, we are including wildfires as an example\nbecause it is well recognized as another type of natural event that can have significant impacts on\na registrant\u2019s financial statements.331 Providing examples of severe weather events, other natural\nconditions, and transition activities in the proposed rule would aid in the comparability of the\nresulting disclosure while assisting issuers in making the disclosures.\nSpecifically, we are proposing that impacts on any relevant line item in the registrant\u2019s\nconsolidated financial statements during the fiscal years presented arising from severe weather\nevents and natural conditions, and the identified physical risks (collectively, \u201cclimate-related\nevents\u201d), would trigger the proposed disclosure requirement discussed below. Specific examples\nof such severe weather events and natural conditions may include the following:\n\u2022 Flooding;\n\u2022 Drought;\n329 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-02(i).\n330 See, e.g., 2010 Guidance, 26 (\u201cSignificant physical effects of climate change, such as effects on the severity of\nweather (for example, floods or hurricanes), [and] sea levels . . . have the potential to affect a registrant\u2019s\noperations and results.\u201d). Temperature extremes and drought are also discussed in the 2010 Guidance. See,\ne.g., id. at 6-7.\n331 See, e.g., Aurora A. Gutierrez et al., Wildfire response to changing daily temperature extremes in California\u2019s\nSierra Nevada, Science Advances, Vol. 7, Issue 47 (Nov. 17, 2021) (\u201cOur work supports the conclusion that\nconsiderable potential exists for an increase in fire activity as a consequence of climate warming in the absence\nof changes in fire and ecosystem management.\u201d); U.S. Geological Survey, Will global warming produce more\nfrequent and more intense wildfires? (\u201c[R]esearchers have found strong correlations between warm summer\ntemperatures and large fire years, so there is general consensus that fire occurrence will increase with climate\nchange.\u201d), available at https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/will-global-warming-produce-more-frequent-and-more-\nintense-wildfires.\n117\n\n\u2022 Wildfires;\n\u2022 Extreme temperatures; and\n\u2022 Sea level rise.332\nAs discussed, above, there has been increased recognition of the current and potential\neffects, both positive and negative, of these events and the associated physical risks on a\nregistrant\u2019s business as well as its financial performance and position. For example, as\nmentioned above, the 2010 Guidance discusses the potential impacts on a registrant\u2019s business\nand financial performance from climate-related events, including, for example, severe weather\nevents, that could negatively impact a registrant\u2019s supply chain or distribution chain and lead to\nhigher input costs or delayed product deliveries.333 The 2010 Guidance also points to credit risks\nfor banks driven by borrowers with assets located in high risk coastal areas.334 More recently,\nthe FSOC\u2019s Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk 2021 discusses significant costs from the\ntypes of events included in proposed Rule 14-02(c).335 The TCFD, in a recent publication, also\ndiscusses the potential financial impacts of such climate-related events.336 Furthermore, the\nTCFD provides examples of disclosures already being made by some companies (including\n332 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-02(c).\n333 See 2010 Guidance, 6.\n334 See id.\n335 See, e.g., 2021 FSOC Report, Chapter 1: From Climate-related Physical Risks to Financial Risks (discussing\nthe listed events and other risks).\n336 TCFD, Implementing the Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (Oct.\n2021), Section A.4 Assessing Financial Impacts of Climate-Related Risks and Opportunities.\n118\n\nregistrants) of the financial statement impact of the climate-related events discussed above in\ntheir standalone sustainability (or equivalent) reports.337\nGenerally, climate-related events such as severe weather events and other natural\nconditions, and climate-related risks more generally, are linked to negative impacts on a\nregistrant\u2019s financial performance and position. There could be situations, however, where such\nevents result in positive impacts. For example, if a registrant\u2019s business is to conduct post-\ndisaster cleanup and reconstruction, the occurrence of such severe weather events would\ngenerate additional revenues for the registrant.\nIn addition to the physical risks associated with climate change, registrants and investors\nalso face climate-related transition risks. As government leaders across the globe have made\npublic commitments to transition to a lower carbon economy, investors have sought information\nabout the impact such a transition may have on registrants.338 In addition to public\ncommitments, these impacts may be prompted by regulatory, technological, market (including\nchanging consumer, business counterparty, and investor preferences), liability, reputational, or\nother transition-related factors.339 For example, significant shifts in modes of production may\noccur in GHG intensive economic sectors, such as the transportation, electricity generation, and\nheavy manufacturing sectors.340 A registrant that is engaged in transition activities may\nexperience business losses or, conversely, may benefit from such transition activities.341 In\n337 See, e.g., TCFD, Guidance on Metrics, Targets, and Transition Plans (Oct. 2021), 23 (Figure C6), Appendix 2,\navailable at https://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/60/2021/07/2021-Metrics_Targets_Guidance-1.pdf (providing\nexamples, mostly from sustainability (or equivalent) reports, that illustrate the feasibility of some of the\ndisclosures that would be required by the proposed rules).\n338 See supra Section I.C.1.\n339 See supra Section II.B.\n340 See, e.g., 2021 FSOC Report, Chapter 1, From Climate-related Transition Risks to Financial Risks.\n341 See id.\n119\n\nresponse, some companies are already providing disclosure of the impact of transition-related\nactivities on their financial statements and some have publicly made commitments related to this\ntransition.342 In light of these transition risks, the proposed rules would also require a registrant\nto disclose the financial impact of the impact of any identified transition risks and any efforts to\nreduce GHG emissions or otherwise mitigate exposure to transition risks (collectively,\n\u201ctransition activities\u201d) on any relevant line items in the registrant\u2019s consolidated financial\nstatements during the fiscal years presented.343\nA registrant may also disclose the impact of any opportunities arising from severe\nweather events and other natural conditions, any impact of efforts to pursue climate-related\nopportunities associated with transition activities, and the impact of any other climate-related\nopportunities, including those identified by the registrant pursuant to proposed Item 1502(a), on\nany of the financial statement metrics.344 If a registrant makes a policy decision to disclose the\nimpact of a climate-related opportunity on the proposed financial statement metrics, it must do so\nconsistently (e.g., for each fiscal year presented in the consolidated financial statements, for each\nfinancial statement line item, for all relevant opportunities identified by the registrant) and must\nfollow the same presentation and disclosure threshold requirements applicable to the required\ndisclosures related to financial impact metrics and expenditure metrics, as discussed below.345\nThe financial impact metric disclosure requirements in proposed Rules 14-02(c), (d), and\n(i) would require a registrant to disclose the financial impacts of severe weather events, other\n342 See, e.g., TCFD, Guidance on Metrics, Targets, and Transition Plans (Oct. 2021), Appendix 2.\n343 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-02(d).\n344 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-02(j).\n345 See id.\n120\n\nnatural conditions, transition activities, and identified climate-related risks on the consolidated\nfinancial statements included in the relevant filing unless the aggregated impact of the severe\nweather events, other natural conditions, transition activities, and identified climate-related risks\nis less than one percent of the total line item for the relevant fiscal year.346 The proposed\nthreshold would provide a bright-line standard for registrants and should reduce the risk of\nunderreporting such information. The proposed quantitative threshold could also promote\ncomparability and consistency among a registrant\u2019s filings over time and among different\nregistrants compared to a principles-based approach. The Commission has used similar one\npercent thresholds in other contexts.347 More generally, in addition to the approach in Article 5\nof Regulation S-X discussed below, other rules such as 17 CFR 229.103 and 17 CFR 229.404\nuse quantitative disclosure thresholds to facilitate comparability, consistency, and clarity in\ndetermining when information must be disclosed.348\nA registrant would be required to determine the impacts of the severe weather events,\nother natural conditions, transition activities, and identified climate-related risks described above\non each consolidated financial statement line item.349 Within each category (i.e., climate-related\n346 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-02(b). The registrant would be required to evaluate the impact on a line-by-line\nbasis consistent with the line items presented in its consolidated financial statements. See proposed 17 CFR\n210.14-02(c) and (d).\n347 The Commission currently uses a 1% threshold in other contexts for disclosure of certain items within the\nfinancial statements and without. See, e.g., 17 CFR 210.5-03.1(a) (stating that if the total of sales and revenues\nreported under this caption includes excise taxes in an amount equal to 1% or more of such total, the amount of\nsuch excise taxes shall be shown on the face of the statement parenthetically or otherwise); 17 CFR 210.12-13\n(requiring disclosure of open option contracts by management investment companies using a 1% of net asset\nvalue threshold, based on the notional amounts of the contracts); and 17 CFR 229.404(d) (requiring disclosure\nof transactions between a SRC and related persons in which the amount involved exceeds the lesser of $120,000\nor 1% of the average of the SRC\u2019s total assets at year-end for the last two completed fiscal years).\n348 See 17 CFR 229.103(b)(2), (c)(3)(iii) and 17 CFR 229.404(a).\n349 Examples of such line items include revenue, cost of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses, sale\nof property, plant, and equipment (in statement of cash flows), inventories, intangible assets, long-term debt, or\ncontingent liabilities.\n121\n\nevents or transition activities), impacts would, at a minimum, be required to be disclosed on an\naggregated, line-by-line basis for all negative impacts and, separately, on an aggregated, line-by-\nline basis for all positive impacts.350 However, for purposes of determining whether the\ndisclosure threshold has been met, a registrant would be required to aggregate the absolute value\nof the positive and negative impacts on a line-by-line basis, which we believe would better\nreflect the significance of the impact of the climate-related events and transition activities on a\nregistrant\u2019s financial performance and position.351\nFor example, when evaluating the line-by-line impact, a registrant may determine that its\ncost of revenue is impacted by Events A, B, and C, and Transition Activity D in the following\nmanner:\n\u2022 Cost of revenue was impacted negatively by Events A and B by $300,000, driven by\nincreased input costs impacted by severe weather events that strained the registrant\u2019s\nmain supplier;\n\u2022 Cost of revenue was impacted positively by Event C by $70,000, driven by technology\nthat improved the registrant\u2019s ability to manage the impact of severe heat on certain raw\nmaterials, which resulted in more efficient production; and\n\u2022 Cost of revenue was impacted positively by Transition Activity D, which reduced\nproduction costs for certain products by $90,000 through advanced technology that\nimproved energy efficiency during the production process.352\n350 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-02(c) and (d).\n351 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-02(b).\n352 This example illustrates a situation where the registrant has elected to include impacts from transition\nopportunities.\n122\n\nFor purposes of determining whether the impacts from the example above would trigger\nthe disclosure threshold requirements, the registrant would perform the analysis illustrated in the\nfollowing table:\nF/S line-item F/S balance (from Impact of Impact of Impact of Absolute value Percentage\nconsolidated Events Event C Transition of impacts impact\nfinancial A and B Activity D\nstatements)\nCost of revenue $10,000,000 -$300,000 +$70,000 +$90,000 $460,000 4.6%\nAlthough some of the impacts (e.g., impact of Event C, impact of Transition Activity D)\ndo not individually meet the one percent threshold, the absolute value of the aggregated impacts\nfrom the events and transition activities on the line item in the above example is $460,000 and\nthus exceeds one percent of the corresponding line-item threshold; therefore, disclosure for that\nspecific line item would be required. The registrant\u2019s disclosure of such impacts may be\nprovided, for example, as illustrated in the following table (excluding disclosure of contextual\ninformation):\nNote X. Climate-related financial metrics:\nF/S Total negative impact Total positive Total negative impact Total positive impact from\nline- from climate-related impact from from climate-related climate-related transition\nitem events climate-related transition activities activities and climate-related\nevents opportunities*\nCost of (Debit) $300,000 (Credit) $70,000 --- (Credit) $90,000\nrevenue\n* As discussed earlier, a registrant may elect to include the impact of climate-related opportunities when\ncalculating its climate-related financial impact metrics. This example illustrates a situation where the registrant\nhas elected to include impacts from transition opportunities.\nIn this example, contextual information may include disclosure such as the registrant\u2019s\nelection to include the impact from opportunities in its disclosure analysis and calculation, the\nspecific events that were aggregated for purposes of determining the impact on the cost of\nrevenue and, if applicable, a discussion of the estimation methodology used to disaggregate the\n123\n\namount of impact on the cost of revenue between the climate-related events, transition activities,\nand other factors.\nTo provide additional clarity, the proposed rule would include the following examples of\ndisclosures that may be required to reflect the impact of the severe weather events and other\nnatural conditions on each line item of the registrant\u2019s consolidated financial statements (e.g.,\nline items of the consolidated income statement, balance sheet, or cash flow statement):353\n\u2022 Changes to revenue or costs from disruptions to business operations or supply chains;\n\u2022 Impairment charges and changes to the carrying amount of assets (such as inventory,\nintangibles, and property, plant and equipment) due to the assets being exposed to severe\nweather, flooding, drought, wildfires, extreme temperatures, and sea level rise;\n\u2022 Changes to loss contingencies or reserves (such as environmental reserves or loan loss\nallowances) due to impact from severe weather events; and\n\u2022 Changes to total expected insured losses due to flooding or wildfire patterns.354\nWith respect to the financial impacts of transition activities, the proposed rule would\ninclude the following examples of potential impacts:\n\u2022 Changes to revenue or cost due to new emissions pricing or regulations resulting in the\nloss of a sales contract;\n\u2022 Changes to operating, investing, or financing cash flow from changes in upstream costs,\nsuch as transportation of raw materials;\n353 The examples below, like all of the examples in this release (including examples in the text of the proposed\nrules), are non-exclusive and should not be interpreted as a checklist for compliance with any proposed rule.\n354 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-02(c)(1) through (4).\n124\n\n\u2022 Changes to the carrying amount of assets (such as intangibles and property, plant, and\nequipment), for example, due to a reduction of the asset\u2019s useful life or a change in the\nasset\u2019s salvage value by being exposed to transition activities; and\n\u2022 Changes to interest expense driven by financing instruments such as climate-linked bonds\nissued where the interest rate increases if certain climate-related targets are not met.355\nMany commenters stated that climate-related financial disclosure is material and should\nbe reflected separately in the financial statements.356 For example, one commenter stated that it\nis critical to investors and others in assessing a company\u2019s risk profile, estimating its risk-\nadjusted returns, and completing other relevant financial analyses to include information on how\nclimate-related risks and climate-related opportunities may affect companies\u2019 income statements,\ncash flow statements, and balance sheets.357\nOther commenters, however, generally expressed the view that if such disclosures are\nmaterial, they would already be required by existing financial statement disclosure\nrequirements.358 For example, some of these commenters stated that they opposed new climate-\nspecific disclosure rules because, in their view, the traditional concept of materiality already\n355 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-02(d)(1) through (4).\n356 See, e.g., letters from Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund et al.;

Furthermore, separately stating the financial\nstatement impacts from the climate-related events and transition activities could improve\ncomparability across both the registrant\u2019s year-to-year disclosures and the disclosures of\ndifferent registrants.\nWe further note that the proposed requirement to separately disclose the financial impacts\nof the climate-related events and transition activities may be necessary not only because climate-\nrelated risks may have significant impacts on individual registrants, but also because the risks\npresented by the climate-related events and transition activities may be correlated across\n359 See letters from American Fuel Petrochemical Manufacturers; Environmental Bankers Association; and The\nAssociated General Contractors of America.\n360 Certain commenters, in response to FASB\u2019s 2021 Agenda Consultation, were also supportive of more\ndisaggregated disclosures within the financial statements. See, e.g., letters from CalPERS (Sept. 22, 2021);\nCFA Institute (Oct. 7, 2021); and CII (Sept. 16, 2021). Comment letters in response to FASB\u2019s invitation to\ncomment are available at\nhttps://www.fasb.org/jsp/FASB/CommentLetter_C/CommentLetterPage&cid=1218220137090&project_id=202\n1-004&page_number=1.\n126\n\ndifferent, similarly situated registrants.361 Climate-related risks present the potential for a high\ncorrelation and therefore concentration of risk within a portfolio. Separate disclosure of climate-\nrelated risks could help to provide investors with information to help them more effectively\nevaluate their portfolio risk. In this regard, we note that an analogous approach to disaggregated,\nor separately stated, disclosure has been taken in other contexts within the financial statements\nand elsewhere.362 For example, in segment reporting, a registrant must present within its\nconsolidated financial statements a separate presentation of certain financial statement line items\nfor each segment.363 The Commission has noted the importance of disaggregated disclosure in\n361 See, e.g., Madison Condon, Market Myopia's Climate Bubble, 2022 UTAH L. REV. 63 (2021). See also 2020\nCFTC Advisory Subcommittee Report (\u201cClimate change is expected to affect multiple sectors, geographies, and\nassets in the United States, sometimes simultaneously and within a relatively short timeframe. As mentioned\nearlier, transition and physical risks\u2014as well as climate and non-climate-related risks\u2014could interact with each\nother, amplifying shocks and stresses. This raises the prospect of spillovers that could disrupt multiple parts of\nthe financial system simultaneously.\u201d).\n362 The analogies presented are not intended to imply that FASB ASC Topic 280, IFRS 8 or other concepts would\nhave to be applied when accounting for and disclosing the climate-related financial statement metrics. The\nanalogies are also not intended to imply that the determination of when disclosure may be required and how that\ndetermination is made is the same across all of these concepts. See, e.g., infra note 363 (discussing\nmanagement\u2019s evaluation under FASB ASC Topic 280 Segment Reporting and IFRS 8 Operating Segments)\nand the discussion below of FASB ASC Topic 606, IFRS 15, and Article 5 of Regulation S-X.\n363 See FASB ASC Topic 280 Segment Reporting and IFRS 8 Operating Segments (requiring segment reporting\ndisclosures to be included in the audited financial statements). FASB ASC 280-10-10-1 states that the objective\nof segment reporting is to provide information about the different types of business activities in which a\nregistrant engages and the different economic environments in which it operates to help users of financial\nstatements: (i) better understand the public entity\u2019s performance; (ii) better assess its prospects for future net\ncash flows; and (iii) make more informed judgments about the public entity as a whole. FASB ASC Topic 280\nand IFRS 8 focus on the chief operating decision maker\u2019s view when evaluating the registrant and prescribes\ncertain qualitative and quantitative considerations when determining what constitutes an operating segment.\nSimilarly, the proposed rule would require an initial determination by the registrant of the relevant climate-\nrelated events and transition activities, and their impact on the registrant\u2019s financial statements.\n127\n\nthe segment reporting context, stating that it \u201chas long been aware of the importance of\nmeaningful segment information to reasoned investment decision-making.\u201d364\nThe importance of disaggregated disclosure in a registrant\u2019s financial statements is also\nsupported by the concepts set forth in FASB ASC Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers and IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which require, among other\nthings, disclosure of disaggregated revenue recognized from contracts with customers into\ncategories that depict how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows\nare affected by economic factors. As noted earlier, the Commission also requires disaggregation\nof certain financial statement line items in Article 5 of Regulation S-X. Specifically, Article 5\nrequires separate disclosures of specific balance sheet and income statement line items when\npracticable or when certain percentage thresholds are met, depending on the nature of the\ninformation.365 Those conditions on when separate disclosure is required are analogous to the\nproposed condition that financial impacts result from the climate-related events and transition\nactivities.\nRequest for Comment\n59. Should we require registrants to disclose the financial impact metrics, as proposed?\nWould presenting climate-specific financial information on a separate basis based on climate-\nrelated events (severe weather events and other natural conditions and identified physical risks)\n364 See Industry and Homogenous Geographic Segment Reporting, Release No. 33-6514 (Feb. 15, 1984) [49 FR\n6737-01 (Feb. 23, 1984)], at 6738. Robust segment reporting disclosures are important as they can provide\ncrucial transparency to investors that are reviewing financial statements. See also Gary Buesser, For the\nInvestor: Segment Reporting, FASB OUTLOOK (Apr. 2019) (\u201c[I]nvestors normally model a company at the\nsegment level rather than at the consolidated level. More segments and greater information about an operating\nsegment improve an analyst\u2019s ability to forecast a company\u2019s revenue, margins and assets \u2013 which serves as the\nbasis for valuing a company.\u201d).\n365 See supra note 347 for examples of the Commission\u2019s use of a 1% threshold in other contexts.\n128\n\nand transition activities (including identified transition risks) elicit decision-useful or material\ninformation for investors? Are there different metrics that would result in disclosure of more\nuseful information about the impact of climate-related risks and climate-related opportunities on\nthe registrant\u2019s financial performance and position?\n60. Would the impact from climate-related events and transition activities yield decision-\nuseful information for investors? Would the climate-related events (including the examples\nprovided) and transition activities result in impacts that are easier to quantify or disaggregate\nthan climate-related risks more generally? Would a registrant be able to quantify and provide the\nproposed disclosure when the impact may be the result of a mixture of factors (e.g., a factory\nshutdown due to an employee strike that occurs simultaneously with a severe weather event)? If\nthere are situations where disaggregation would not be practicable, should we require a registrant\nto disclose that it was unable to make the required determination and why, or to make a\nreasonable estimate and provide disclosure about the assumptions and information that resulted\nin the estimate?\n61. Alternatively, should we not require disclosure of the impacts of identified climate-\nrelated risks and only require disclosure of impacts from severe weather events and other natural\nconditions? Should we require a registrant to disclose the impact on its consolidated financial\nstatements of only certain examples of severe weather events and other natural conditions? If so,\nshould we specify which severe weather events and other natural conditions the registrant must\ninclude? Would requiring disclosure of the impact of a smaller subset of climate-related risks be\neasier for a registrant to quantify without sacrificing information that would be material to\ninvestors?\n129\n\n62. Should impact from climate-related opportunities be required, instead of optional, as\nproposed? We are proposing to require a registrant that elects to disclose the impact of an\nopportunity to do so consistently (e.g., for each fiscal year presented in the consolidated financial\nstatements, for each financial statement line item, and for all relevant opportunities identified by\nthe registrant). Are there any other requirements that we should include to enhance consistency?\nShould we only require consistency between the first fiscal period in which opportunities were\ndisclosed and subsequent periods?\n63. Is it clear which climate-related events would be covered by \u201csevere weather events and\nother natural conditions\u201d? If not, should we provide additional guidance or examples about what\nevents would be covered? Should we clarify that what is considered \u201csevere weather\u201d in one\nregion may differ from another region? For example, high levels of rainfall may be considered\n\u201csevere weather\u201d in a typically arid region.\n64. Are the proposed requirements for calculating and presenting the financial impact metrics\nclear? Should the analysis be performed and disclosed in a manner other than on a line-by-line\nbasis referring to the line items of the registrant\u2019s consolidated financial statements?\n65. We are proposing to allow a registrant to aggregate the absolute value of negative and\npositive impacts of all climate-related events and, separately, transition activities on a financial\nstatement line item. Should we instead require separate quantitative disclosure of the impact of\neach climate-related event or transition activity? Should we require separate disclosure of the\nimpact of climate-related opportunities that a registrant chooses to disclose?\n66. The proposed financial impact metrics would not require disclosure if the absolute value\nof the total impact is less than one percent of the total line item for the relevant fiscal year. Is the\nproposed threshold appropriate? Should we use a different percentage threshold (e.g., three\n130\n\npercent, five percent) or use a dollar threshold (e.g., less than or greater than $1 million)?\nShould we use a combination of a percentage threshold and a dollar threshold? Should we only\nrequire disclosure when the financial impact exceeds the threshold, as proposed, or should we\nalso require a determination of whether an impact that falls below the proposed quantitative\nthreshold would be material and should be disclosed?\n67. For purposes of determining whether the disclosure threshold has been met, should\nimpacts on a line item from climate-related events and transition activities be permitted to offset\n(netting of positive and negative impacts), instead of aggregating on an absolute value basis as\nproposed? Should we prescribe how to analyze positive and negative impacts on a line item\nresulting from the same climate-related event or the same transition activity (e.g., whether or not\nnetting is permitted at an event or activity level)? Should we permit registrants to determine\nwhether or not to offset as a policy decision (netting of the positive and negative impact within\nan event or activity) and provide relevant contextual information? Should we require the\ndisclosure threshold to be calculated separately for the climate-related events and transition\nactivities, rather than requiring all of the impacts to be aggregated as proposed?\n68. Instead of including a quantitative threshold, as proposed, should we require\ndisaggregated disclosure of any impact of climate-related risks on a particular line item of the\nregistrant\u2019s consolidated financial statements? Alternatively, should we just use a materiality\nstandard?\n69. Should we require a registrant to disclose changes to the cost of capital resulting from the\nclimate-related events? If so, should we require a registrant to disclose its weighted average cost\nof capital or any internal cost of capital metrics? Would such disclosure elicit decision-useful or\nmaterial information for investors?\n131"

Should we define that term or any\nothers? If so, how should we define them?\n71. Are the proposed examples in the financial impact metrics helpful for understanding the\ntypes of disclosure that would be required? Should we provide different or additional examples\nor guidance?\n3. Expenditure Metrics\nThe proposed expenditure metrics would refer to the positive and negative impacts\nassociated with the same climate-related events, transition activities, and identified climate-\nrelated risks as the proposed financial impact metrics.366 As proposed, the expenditure metrics\nwould require a registrant to separately aggregate amounts of (i) expenditure expensed and (ii)\ncapitalized costs incurred during the fiscal years presented.367 For each of those categories, a\nregistrant would be required to disclose separately the amount incurred during the fiscal years\npresented (i) toward positive and negative impacts associated with the climate-related events\n(i.e., severe weather events and other natural conditions and identified physical risks) and (ii)\ntoward transition activities, specifically, to reduce GHG emissions or otherwise mitigate\nexposure to transition risks (including identified transition risks).368 The registrant may also\nchoose to disclose the impact of efforts to pursue climate-related opportunities associated with\ntransition activities.369 As discussed above, if a registrant elects to disclose the impact of an\n366 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-02(e), (f), and (i).\n367 See id. These metrics are focused on expenditures (spending) incurred in each reported fiscal year(s). We\ntherefore believe the number of periods of the expenditure metrics should correspond to the number of years of\nincome statement or cash flow statement presented in the consolidated financial statements.\n368 See id.\n369 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-02(j).\n132\n\nopportunity, it must do so consistently and must follow the same presentation and disclosure\nthreshold requirements applicable to the required disclosures of expenditure metrics associated\nwith transition risks. The amount of expenditure disclosed pursuant to the proposed metrics\nwould be a portion, if not all, of the registrant\u2019s total recorded expenditure (expensed or\ncapitalized), as calculated pursuant to the accounting principles applicable to the registrant\u2019s\nfinancial statements.370\nThe proposed expenditure metrics would be subject to the same disclosure threshold as\nthe financial impact metrics, which we believe would promote comparability, consistency, and\nclarity in determining when information must be disclosed. For purposes of calculating the\ndisclosure threshold for the expenditure metrics, a registrant would be permitted to separately\ndetermine the amount of expenditure expensed and the amount of expenditure capitalized;\nhowever, a registrant would be required to aggregate expenditure related to climate-related\nevents and transition activities within the categories of expenditure (i.e., amount capitalized and\namount expensed). This approach should better reflect the significance of climate-related\nexpenditure compared to a calculation approach that would allow for a disclosure threshold to be\nmeasured at the individual event or activity level, which may result in more limited disclosures.\nFor example, assume a registrant capitalized $200,000 of expenditure incurred related to\nEvent D and capitalized another $100,000 of expenditure incurred related to Activity E. The\nregistrant also expensed $25,000 of expenditure incurred related to Event F (which is an\nidentified transition risk disclosed by the registrant). The registrant would determine whether the\n370 See 17 CFR 210.4-01(a)(1) and (2).\n133\n\nimpacts would trigger the disclosure requirements based on the proposed thresholds, as\nillustrated below:\nExpenditure Current fiscal Event D Activity E Event F Percentage\ncategory year balances impact\n(from\nconsolidated\nfinancial\nstatements)*\nCapitalized $8,000,000 $200,000 $100,000 3.85%**\ncosts (total\nexpenditure\nincurred during\nthe year that\nwas capitalized)\nExpense (total $3,000,000 $25,000 0.8%\nexpenditure\nincurred during\nthe year that\nwas expensed)\n*As expenditures capitalized and expensed are recorded in various financial statement line items, we expect the\n\u201ctotal\u201d to be used for disclosure threshold calculation purposes for each category to represent the aggregated\nexpenditures capitalized during the fiscal year and aggregated expenditures expensed during the fiscal year. See\nbelow for additional discussion regarding associated contextual information that may be required.\n**Calculated based on total impact on capitalized costs from Event D ($200,000), Activity E ($100,000), and\nEvent F ($0): $300,000/$8,000,000.\nIn the above example, the expenditure incurred toward Event D was $200,000\n(capitalized) and the expenditure incurred toward Activity E and Event F were $100,000\n(capitalized) and $25,000 (expensed). The amount of capitalized costs equaled the proposed one\npercent threshold, and thus the disclosure would be required for that category of expenditure. No\ndisclosure would be required for the expenditure incurred that was expensed (related to Event F\nin this example), because it was below the one percent threshold. The registrant\u2019s resulting\ndisclosure of such expenditure (capitalized or expensed) may be provided, for example, as\nillustrated in the following table (excluding disclosure of contextual information):\nNote X. Climate-related financial metrics:\nExpenditure incurred for climate- Expenditure incurred for\nrelated events climate-related transition activities\nCapitalized costs $200,000 $100,000\n134\n\nIn this example, contextual information may include disclosure such as the specific\nclimate-related events and transition activities that were aggregated for purposes of determining\nthe impacts on the capitalized or expensed expenditure amounts and, if applicable, policy\ndecisions made by a registrant to determine the amount of climate-related events or transition\nactivities that are categorized as expenditure capitalized versus expenditure expensed or whether\nimpact from pursuing any climate-related opportunities are included in the analysis. Contextual\ninformation may also include a discussion of the composition of the total expenditure expensed\nand total expenditure capitalized, which were used to calculate whether the disclosure threshold\nwas met, and, if applicable, a discussion of the estimation methodology used to disaggregate the\namount of impact between the climate-related events, transition activities, and other factors,\nincluding if an event or an activity impacted both capitalized and expensed costs.\nThe proposed rules would clarify that a registrant may be required to disclose the amount\nof expenditure expensed or capitalized costs, as applicable, incurred for the climate-related\nevents to increase the resilience of assets or operations, retire or shorten the estimated useful\nlives of impacted assets, relocate assets or operations at risk, or otherwise reduce the future\nimpact of severe weather events and other natural conditions on business operations.371 The\nproposed rules would also clarify that a registrant may be required to disclose the amount of\nexpenditure expensed or capitalized costs, as applicable, incurred for climate-related transition\nactivities related to research and development of new technologies, purchase of assets,\ninfrastructure, or products that are intended to reduce GHG emissions, increase energy\nefficiency, offset emissions (purchase of energy credits), or improve other resource efficiency.372\n371 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-02(e).\n372 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-02(f).\n135\n\nSeveral commenters recommended taking a similar approach, stating that we should\nrequire disclosure of climate-related capital expenditure (i.e., capitalized assets),373 or both\nclimate-related expenses and capitalized assets.374 Consistent with these comments, and for\nsimilar reasons to those stated above with respect to the financial impact metrics, separate\ndisclosure of total expense and total capitalized costs incurred toward the climate-related events\nand transition activities should provide important information to help investors make better\ninformed investment or voting decisions. Moreover, the financial impacts of expenditure\ntypically appear in different places within the financial statements (e.g., in an asset line item(s)\non the balance sheet or in an expense line item(s) in the income statement). The proposed\napproach is intended to address this dispersed presentation by requiring registrants to first\nidentify the relevant climate-related expenditures and then compile those impacts in one location.\nSimilar to the proposed financial impact metrics, such an approach should provide insight into,\nand context for understanding, the nature of a registrant\u2019s business, including any disclosed\nstrategy for addressing and managing the specified risks\u2014particularly in the context of transition\nplanning.375\nRequest for Comment\n72. Should we require registrants to disclose the expenditure metrics, as proposed? Would\npresenting the expenditure metrics separately in one location provide decision-useful information\n373 See, e.g., letters from Amalgamated Bank; Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility; and Natural Resources\nDefense Council.\n374 See, e.g., letters from Calvert; Climate Risk Disclosure Lab; and World Benchmarking Alliance.\n375 See supra Section II.C, which discusses our proposals to require the registrant to describe the actual and\npotential impacts of the identified climate-related risks (and climate-related opportunities if the registrant elects\nto do so) on its strategy, business model, and outlook. Further, such disclosure could also provide additional\ncontext to other narrative disclosures such as the discussion of risk factors required by 17 CFR 229.105.\n136\n\nto investors? Is there a different type of metric that would result in more useful disclosure of the\nexpense or capitalized costs incurred toward climate-related events and transition activities or\ntoward climate-related risks more generally?\n73. Would the disclosure required by the expenditure metrics overlap with the disclosure\nrequired by the financial impact metrics? If so, should we require the disclosure to be provided\npursuant to only one of these types of metrics?\n74. Should the same climate-related events (including severe weather events and other\nnatural conditions and identified physical risks) and transition activities (including identified\ntransition risks) that we are proposing to use for the financial impact metrics apply to the\nexpenditure metrics, as proposed? Alternatively, should we not require a registrant to disclose\nexpenditure incurred towards identified climate-related risks and only require disclosure of\nexpenditure relating to severe weather events and other natural conditions? Should we require a\nregistrant to disclose the expenditure incurred toward only certain examples of severe weather\nevents and other natural conditions? If so, should we specify which severe weather events and\nother natural conditions the registrant must include? Would requiring disclosure of the\nexpenditure relating to a smaller subset of climate-related risks be easier for a registrant to\nquantify without sacrificing information that would be material to investors?\n75. Should the proposed rules instead require a registrant to disclose the aggregate amounts\nof expensed and capitalized costs incurred toward any climate-related risks? Should\nexpenditures incurred towards climate-related opportunities be optional based on a registrant\u2019s\nelection to disclose such opportunities, as proposed?\n76. Should we apply the same disclosure threshold to the expenditure metrics and the\nfinancial impact metrics? Is the proposed threshold for expenditure metrics appropriate? Should\n137\n\nwe use a different percentage threshold (e.g., three percent, five percent) or use a dollar threshold\n(e.g., less than or greater than $1 million)? Should we use a combination of a percentage\nthreshold and a dollar threshold? Should we only require disclosure when the amount of\nclimate-related expenditure exceeds the threshold, as proposed, or should we also require a\ndetermination of whether an amount of expenditure that falls below the proposed quantitative\nthreshold would be material and should be disclosed? Should we require separate aggregation of\nthe amount of expense and capitalized costs for purposes of the threshold, as proposed? Should\nwe require separate aggregation of expenditure relating to the climate-related events and\ntransition activities, as proposed?\n77. Instead of including a quantitative threshold, as proposed, should we require\ndisaggregated disclosure of any amount of expense and capitalized costs incurred toward the\nclimate-related events and transition activities, during the periods presented? Alternatively,\nshould we just use a materiality standard?\n78. Are the proposed requirements for calculating and presenting the expenditure metrics\nclear? Should the analysis be performed and disclosed in a different manner, other than\nseparately based on capitalized costs and amount of expenditure expensed and separately based\non the climate-related events and transition activities? Should disclosure of expenditure incurred\nbe required for both the amount of capitalized costs and the amount of expenditure expensed if\nonly one of the two types of expenditure meets the disclosure threshold? Should we require\nseparate disclosure of expenditure incurred toward each climate-related event and transition\nactivity?\n79. The proposed rule does not specifically address expensed or capitalized costs that are\npartially incurred towards the climate-related events and transition activities (e.g., the\n138"

Are the proposed terms and examples used in the expenditure metrics helpful for\nunderstanding the types of disclosures that would be required? Should we provide different or\nadditional examples?\n4. Financial Estimates and Assumptions\nThe proposed rules would require a registrant to disclose whether the estimates and\nassumptions used to produce the consolidated financial statements were impacted by exposures\nto risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, climate-related events\n(including identified physical risks and severe weather events and other natural conditions), such\nas flooding, drought, wildfires, extreme temperatures, sea level rise.376 If so, the registrant would\nbe required to provide a qualitative description of how such events have impacted the\ndevelopment of the estimates and assumptions used by the registrant in the preparation of such\nfinancial statements. Similar to the other proposed financial statement metrics, the proposed\nrules would include a provision that would require separate disclosure focused on transition\nactivities (including identified transition risks).377 Further, if a registrant elects to disclose the\nimpact of an opportunity on its financial estimates and assumptions, it must do so consistently\n376 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-02(g) and (i).\n377 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-02(h) and (i).\n139\n\nand must follow the same presentation and disclosure requirements applicable to the required\ndisclosures herein.378\nIf the estimates and assumptions a registrant used to produce the consolidated financial\nstatements were impacted by risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, a\npotential transition to a lower carbon economy or any climate-related targets it has disclosed, the\nregistrant would be required to provide a qualitative description of how the development of the\nestimates and assumptions were impacted by such a potential transition or the registrant\u2019s\ndisclosed climate-related targets.\nEstimates and assumptions are currently required for accounting and financial reporting\npurposes (e.g., projected financial information used in impairment calculations, estimated loss\ncontingencies, estimated credit risks, commodity price assumptions, etc.). The proposed\ndisclosures could provide decision-useful information and transparency to investors about the\nimpact of the climate-related events and transition activities, including disclosed targets and\ngoals,379 on such estimates and assumptions. Moreover, in addition to providing insight into\nimpacts on the registrant\u2019s financial statements, such disclosure could allow investors to evaluate\nthe reasonableness of the registrant\u2019s estimates and assumptions, which are used to prepare the\nregistrant\u2019s financial statements. Although current accounting standards require registrants to\nconsider how climate-related matters may intersect with and affect the financial statements,\n378 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-02(j).\n379 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1506.\n140\n\nincluding their impact on estimates and assumptions,380 the nature of the climate-related events\nand transition activities discussed in the proposed rules, which may manifest over a longer time\nhorizon, necessitate targeted disclosure requirements to elicit decision-useful information for\ninvestors in a consistent manner. We also note that some registrants have already provided\ndisclosure along the lines of the proposed requirements, which lends support to the feasibility of\nmaking such disclosures.381\nBy way of example, the proposed climate-related events and impacts relating to a\ntransition away from greenhouse gas producing products and activities could affect a registrant\u2019s\nasset values and may result in asset impairments. The effect on asset values and the resulting\nimpairments could, in turn, affect a registrant\u2019s assumptions when calculating depreciation\nexpenses or asset retirement obligations associated with the retirement of tangible, long-lived\nassets. Providing related disclosure could help an investor understand if a registrant would be\nresponsible for removing equipment or cleaning up hazardous materials sooner than originally\nplanned due to a severe weather event. Similarly, a registrant\u2019s climate-related targets and\nrelated commitments, such as a commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040, may impact\ncertain accounting estimates and assumptions. For example, if a registrant announced a\n380 See FASB Staff Educational Paper, Intersection of Environmental, Social and Governance Matters with\nFinancial Accounting Standards (Mar. 2021), available at\nhttps://fasb.org/jsp/FASB/Document_C/DocumentPage&cid=1176176379917. See also IFRS, Effects of\nclimate-related matters on financial statements (Nov. 2020), available at\nhttps://www.ifrs.org/content/dam/ifrs/supporting-implementation/documents/effects-of-climate-related-matters-\non-financial-statements.pdf#:~:text=IFRS%20Standards%20do%20not%20refer%\n20explicitly%20to%20climate-related,significant%20judgements%20and%20estimates%20that%20\nmanagement%20has%20made. We also remind registrants of the requirements under FASB ASC Topic 250-\n10-50-4 for disclosures of changes in accounting estimates, including the requirement that if a change in\nestimate does not have a material effect in the period of change, but is reasonably certain to have a material\neffect in later periods, a description of that change in estimate must be disclosed whenever the financial\nstatements of the period of change are presented.\n381 See letter from Carbon Tracker (stating that some companies in the European Union and United Kingdom\n(several of which are registrants) are already providing this information and providing examples).\n141\n\ncommitment that would require decommissioning an asset by a target year, then the registrant\u2019s\ndepreciation expense should reflect alignment with that commitment. If the registrant believes it\ncan execute a strategy that would allow it to meet the commitment and continue to operate the\nasset past the target date, then the proposed disclosure requirement could facilitate an investor\u2019s\nunderstanding and own assessment of the feasibility of that strategy. Other financial statement\nestimates and assumptions that may require disclosure pursuant to the proposed rules may\ninclude those related to the estimated salvage value of certain assets, estimated useful life of\ncertain assets, projected financial information used in impairment calculations, estimated loss\ncontingencies, estimated reserves (such as environmental reserve or loan loss allowances),\nestimated credit risks, fair value measurement of certain assets, and commodity price\nassumptions.\nSeveral commenters stated that it was important to provide investors with an\nunderstanding of how climate-related events and activities are considered when a registrant\ndevelops the assumptions and estimates used to prepare its financial statements.382 In particular,\none commenter stated that investors may face \u201csubstantial risk\u201d if disclosure on the impact of\n\u201cdecarbonization\u201d on the estimates and assumptions underlying asset valuations is not\ndisclosed.383 Another commenter stated that \u201ccurrent corporate disclosure is not sufficient, is not\nreadily available in existing financial disclosures, and does not allow investors to make\ncomparable assessments of how companies are evaluating and responding to climate-related\nrisks and opportunities.\u201d384\n382 See, e.g., letters from Carbon Tracker; Climate Accounting Project; ICCR; and Institute for Policy Integrity,\nEnvironmental Defense Fund, Initiative on Climate Risk & Resilience Law.\n383 See letter from Carbon Tracker.\n384 See letter from ICCR.\n142\n\nRequest for Comment\n81. Should we require disclosure of financial estimates and assumptions impacted by the\nclimate-related events and transition activities (including disclosed targets), as proposed? How\nwould investors use this information?\n82. Should we instead require disclosure of only significant or material estimates and\nassumptions that were impacted by the climate-related events and transition activities?\nAlternatively, should we require disclosure of only estimates and assumptions that were\nmaterially impacted by the climate-related events and transition activities?\n83. Should we instead require disclosure of financial estimates and assumptions impacts by a\nsubset of climate-related events and transition activities, such as not requiring disclosure related\nto identified climate-related risks or only requiring disclosure with respect to a subset of severe\nweather events and natural conditions? If so, how should the subset be defined?\n84. Should we instead utilize terminology and thresholds consistent with the critical\naccounting estimate disclosure requirement in 17 CFR 229.303(b)(3), such as \u201cestimates made in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of\nestimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the\nfinancial condition or results of operations of the registrant\u201d? If so, should we only require\ndisclosures of whether and how the climate-related events and transition activities impacted such\ncritical accounting estimates? Should we require only a qualitative description of how the\nestimates and assumptions were impacted by the climate-related events and transition activities,\nas proposed? Should we require quantitative disclosures as well? If so, should we require such\ndisclosure only if practicable or subject to another qualifier?\n143"

GHG Emissions Metrics Disclosure\n1. GHG Emissions Disclosure Requirement\na. Overview\nIn addition to the other proposed climate-related disclosures, the proposed rules would\nrequire a registrant to disclose its GHG emissions for its most recently completed fiscal year.386\nAs institutional investors and other commenters have indicated, GHG emissions information is\nimportant to investment decisions for various reasons, including because GHG emissions data is\nquantifiable and comparable across industries and can be particularly useful in conducting a\ntransition risk analysis;387 it can be used to evaluate the progress in meeting net-zero\ncommitments and assessing any associated risks;388 and it may be relevant to investment or\nvoting decisions because GHG emissions could impact the company\u2019s access to financing, as\nwell as its ability to reduce its carbon footprint in the face of regulatory, policy, and market\nconstraints.389 Thus, while the justifications for the proposed GHG emissions disclosures\noverlap in some respects with the justifications for the other proposed climate-related disclosure\nrules, the GHG emissions requirements are intended to address separate challenges and are\nsupported by the particular justifications discussed in detail in the following sections.\n386 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(a). As discussed below, the proposed rules would also require a registrant to\ndisclose its GHG emissions for the historical fiscal years included in its consolidated financial statements.\n387 See, e.g., infra note 432 and accompanying text.\n388 See, e.g., infra, note 433 and accompanying text.\n389 See, e.g., infra note 455 and accompanying text.\n147\n\nThe proposed rules would establish certain requirements regarding the measurement and\nreporting of GHG emissions that would promote the comparability of such disclosure. We have\nbased the proposed GHG emissions disclosure rules on the concept of scopes, which are\nthemselves based on the concepts of direct and indirect emissions, developed by the GHG\nProtocol. We also have proposed definitions of Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions that are\nsubstantially similar to the corresponding definitions provided by the GHG Protocol.\nCommenters indicated that the GHG Protocol has become the leading accounting and reporting\nstandard for GHG emissions.390 By sharing certain basic concepts and a common vocabulary\nwith the GHG Protocol, the proposed rules should help limit the compliance burden for those\nregistrants that are already disclosing their GHG emissions pursuant to the GHG Protocol.391\nSimilarly, to the extent that registrants elect to follow GHG Protocol standards and\nmethodologies, investors already familiar with the GHG Protocol may also benefit.\nThe proposed rules would define \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d as carbon dioxide (\u201cCO ); methane\n2\u201d\n(\u201cCH \u201d); nitrous oxide (\u201cN O\u201d); nitrogen trifluoride (\u201cNF \u201d); hydrofluorocarbons (\u201cHFCs\u201d);\n4 2 3\nperfluorocarbons (\u201cPFCs\u201d); and sulfur hexafluoride (\u201cSF \u201d).392 The greenhouse gases included\n6\nin the proposed definition reflect the gases that are currently commonly referenced by\ninternational, scientific, and regulatory authorities as having significant climate impacts. In\n390 See supra note 112 and accompanying text.\n391 In addition, as discussed in Section II.G.2.d, the proposed rules would permit a registrant, if actual reported data\nis not reasonably available, to use a reasonable estimate of its GHG emissions for its fourth fiscal quarter,\ntogether with actual, determined GHG emissions data for the first three fiscal quarters, as long as the registrant\npromptly discloses in a subsequent filing any material difference between the estimate used and the actual,\ndetermined GHG emissions data for the fourth fiscal quarter. See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(e)(4)(i). This\nproposed provision should also help mitigate the GHG emissions compliance burden for registrants.\n392 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(g).\n148\n\naddition to being consistent with the GHG Protocol,393 the list of constituent greenhouse gases\nwould be consistent with the gases identified by widely used frameworks, such as the Kyoto\nProtocol, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the U.S. Energy Information\nAdministration, and the EPA.394\nThe proposed rules would define GHG emissions to mean direct and indirect emissions\nof greenhouse gases.395 Pursuant to the proposed definition of GHG emissions, direct emissions\nare GHG emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by a registrant,396 whereas indirect\nemissions are GHG emissions that result from the activities of the registrant, but occur at sources\nnot owned or controlled by the registrant.397 Similar to the GHG Protocol, the proposed rules\nwould define:398\n393 In Feb. 2013 the GHG Protocol amended the required greenhouse gas inventory list to align with the seven\ngases required by the Kyoto Protocol (consistent with the proposed definition of greenhouse gases). See GHG\nProtocol, Required Greenhouse Gases in Inventories: Accounting and Reporting Standard Amendment (Feb.\n2013), available at https://www.ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/ghgp/NF3-Amendment_052213.pdf.\nNevertheless, the GHG Protocol\u2019s Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, which was updated in 2015,\ncontinues to refer to only six greenhouse gases. We believe the common understanding of the GHG Protocol\u2019s\nCorporate Accounting and Reporting Standard is that the earlier amendment (reflecting seven gases) applies\ndespite the subsequent 2015 update to the standard.\n394 See UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (\u201cUNFCCC\u201d) \u2013 Reporting requirements (last visited Nov.\n4, 2021), available at https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/transparency-and-reporting/reporting-and-review-\nunder-the-convention/greenhouse-gas-inventories-annex-i-parties/reporting-requirements. The Kyoto Protocol\nis the international agreement linked to the UNFCCC.

See, e.g., EPA, Sources of\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions, available at https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-\nemissions. ).\n149\n\n\u2022 Scope 1 emissions as direct GHG emissions from operations that are owned or controlled\nby a registrant;399\n\u2022 Scope 2 emissions as indirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased or\nacquired electricity, steam, heat, or cooling that is consumed by operations owned or\ncontrolled by a registrant;400 and\n\u2022 Scope 3 emissions as all indirect GHG emissions not otherwise included in a registrant\u2019s\nScope 2 emissions, which occur in the upstream and downstream activities of a\nregistrant\u2019s value chain.401 Upstream emissions include emissions attributable to goods\nand services that the registrant acquires, the transportation of goods (for example, to the\nregistrant), and employee business travel and commuting. Downstream emissions\ninclude the use of the registrant\u2019s products, transportation of products (for example, to the\nregistrant\u2019s customers), end of life treatment of sold products, and investments made by\nthe registrant.\nAs previously noted, the EPA uses the concept of scopes, and refers to the GHG Protocol,\nwhen providing guidance to companies regarding their GHG emissions inventories.402 Because\nGHG emissions data compiled for the EPA\u2019s own GHG emissions reporting program would be\nconsistent with the GHG Protocol\u2019s standards, and thus with the proposed rules, a registrant may\nuse that data in partial fulfillment of its GHG emissions disclosure obligations pursuant to the\nproposed rules.\n399 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(p).\n400 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(q).\n401 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(r).\n402 See supra note 113. The EPA requires the disclosure of direct GHG emissions primarily from large industrial\nsources as well as emissions from fuel and industrial gas suppliers and CO injection sites in the United States.\n2\nSee EPA, Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, available at https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting.\n150\n\nThe proposed rules would require a registrant to disclose its total Scope 1 emissions\nseparately from its total Scope 2 emissions after calculating them from all sources that are\nincluded in the registrant\u2019s organizational and operational boundaries.403 A registrant would also\nbe required to disclose separately its total Scope 3 emissions for the fiscal year if those emissions\nare material, or if it has set a GHG emissions reduction target or goal that includes its Scope 3\nemissions.404 For each of its Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions, the proposed rules would require a\nregistrant to disclose the emissions both disaggregated by each constituent greenhouse gas (e.g.,\nby carbon dioxide (CO methane (CH , nitrous oxide (N O), nitrogen trifluoride (NF ),\n2), 4) 2 3\nhydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF )) and in the\n6\naggregate.405 By requiring the disclosure of GHG emissions both disaggregated by the\nconstituent greenhouse gases and in the aggregate, investors could gain decision-useful\ninformation regarding the relative risks to the registrant posed by each constituent greenhouse\ngas in addition to the risks posed by its total GHG emissions by scope. For example, if a\ngovernment targets reduction of a specific greenhouse gas, knowing that a registrant has\nsignificant emissions of such gas would provide insight into potential impacts on the registrant\u2019s\nbusiness.406 Because measuring the constituent greenhouse gases is a necessary step in\n403 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(b)(1). We discuss the setting of a registrant\u2019s organizational and operational\nboundaries in Section II.G.2. below.\n404 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(c)(1). As discussed in greater detail below, for many companies, these\nemissions may be material for assessing the companies\u2019 exposure to climate-related risks, particularly transition\nrisks, and their strategy to reduce their carbon footprint in the face of regulatory, policy, and market constraints.\nSee infra Section II.G.1.b.\n405 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(a)(1).\n406 For example, the White House has recently launched an initiative to reduce methane emissions in the United\nStates. See the White House Office of Domestic Climate Policy, U.S. Methane Emissions Reductions Action\nPlan (Nov. 2021), available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/US-Methane-\nEmissions-Reduction-Action-Plan-1.pdf.\n151\n\ncalculating a registrant\u2019s total GHG emissions per scope, the proposed disaggregation by each\nconstituent greenhouse gas should not create significant additional burdens.\nConsistent with the GHG Protocol, the proposed rules would require a registrant to\nexpress each scope of its GHG emissions in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent (\u201cCO e\u201d).407\n2\nCO e is the common unit of measurement used by the GHG Protocol to indicate the global\n2\nwarming potential (\u201cGWP\u201d)408 of each greenhouse gas, expressed in terms of the GWP of one\nunit of carbon dioxide (CO ).409 Requiring a standard unit of measurement for GHG emissions,\n2\nrather than different units of measurement for the different greenhouse gases, should simplify the\ndisclosure for investors and enhance its comparability across registrants with different types of\nGHG emissions.\nFor all scopes of GHG emissions, the proposed rules would require a registrant to\ndisclose GHG emissions data in gross terms, excluding any use of purchased or generated\noffsets.410 Because the value of offsets can vary depending on restrictions that are or may be\nimposed by regulation or market conditions, disclosing GHG emissions data in this manner\nwould allow investors to assess the full magnitude of climate-related risk posed by a registrant\u2019s\nGHG emissions and the registrant\u2019s plans for managing such risk. This proposed approach also\nis consistent with the approach taken by the GHG Protocol.411\n407 See id.\n408 The proposed rules would define global warming potential to mean a factor describing the global warming\nimpacts of different greenhouse gases. It is a measure of how much energy will be absorbed in the atmosphere\nover a specified period of time as a result of the emission of one ton of a greenhouse gas, relative to the\nemissions of one ton of carbon dioxide (CO See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(f).\n2).\n409 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(d).\n410 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(a)(2). The proposed rules would define carbon offsets to represent an\nemissions reduction or removal of greenhouse gases in a manner calculated and traced for the purpose of\noffsetting an entity\u2019s GHG emissions. See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(a).\n411 See GHG Protocol, Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Chapter 9.\n152\n\nCommenters generally supported requiring disclosure of a registrant\u2019s Scope 1 and Scope\n2 emissions, with many also supporting disclosure of Scope 3 emissions.412 A common reason\nasserted by commenters for requiring GHG emissions disclosure is that quantitative data, such as\nGHG emissions data, is useful for assessing a registrant\u2019s exposure to climate-related risks and\naccordingly its ability to transition to a lower carbon economy.413 Investors that are currently\n412 See, e.g., letters from Actual Systems, Inc.; Adobe Inc.; AICPA; Curt Albright (June 13, 2021);\nAllianceBernstein; Alphabet et al.; Amalgamated Bank; Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund;\nAndrew Behar; Apple; Ted Atwood; Baillie Gifford; Bank of America Corporation; BlackRock; Bloomberg,\nLP; Blueprint Financial; BNP Paribas; Rob Bonta, California Attorney General et al.; Boston Common Asset\nManagement; BSR; CalPERS; CALSTRS; Calvert Research and Management; Carbon4 Finance (June 14,\n2021); Carbon180 (June 13, 2021); Carbon Tracker Initiative; Cardano Risk Management Ltd.; Carolyn\nKohoot; CDP NA; Center for American Progress; Center for Climate and Energy Solutions; Center for Law and\nSocial Policy and a New Deal for Youth (June 15, 2021); Ceres et al.; Certified B Corporations; Chevron;\nChristopher Lish; Clean Yield Asset Management; Climate Advisers; Climate Governance Initiative Climate\nRisk Disclosure Law and Policy Lab; Climate Policy Ocean Conservancy (June 14, 2021); Coalition on\nMaterial Emissions Transparency (COMET) (June 10, 2021); Confluence Philanthropy; Consumer Federation\nof America; Crake Asset Management (June 4, 2021); Credit Suisse (June 11, 2021); Daniel Cain; Katherine\nDiMatteo; Domini Impact Investments LLC; Douglas Hileman Consulting, LLC; Dow (June 4, 2021);\nDynamhex Inc.; Energy Infrastructure Council (June 14, 2014); Environmental Bankers Association; E2; E3G;\nERM CVS; Etsy, Inc.; FAIRR Initiative; First Affirmative Financial Network; Regenerative Crisis Response\nCommittee; the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment; Friends of the Earth, Amazon Watch, and\nRainForect Action Network; Generation Investment Management LLP (June 14, 2021); Georgetown Climate\nCenter (June 14, 2021); George S.

In each situation, there is a lack of consistency, comparability, and\nreliability in those data that our proposal seeks to address.415\nSome of these commenters supported requiring disclosure of Scope 1 emissions at the\nindividual greenhouse gas level.416 Although commenters noted an increase in the voluntary\nreporting of climate-related disclosure, several also stated that significant gaps remain in the\n414 See, e.g., letters from Bloomberg, LP (stating that GHG emissions are critical components of any climate-\nrelated financial disclosure scheme, and that understanding the emissions contributions of a company is an\nimportant factor for understanding how financially vulnerable they may be to shifts in regulation, technology,\nand markets during any transition to a lower-carbon economy); CalPers (indicating the use of GHG emissions\ndata by asset managers to evaluate potential transition risks); and Credit Suisse (supporting mandatory\ndisclosure of Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions for key industries as such information is critical for financial market\nparticipants to have a better understanding of their total climate-related exposure to the highest emitting\nsectors).\n415 See, e.g., letters from CALSTRS (indicating the use by asset managers of third-party derived climate data, the\nexpense and lack of consistency regarding such data, and the need for publicly available climate data so that the\ncommenter may more efficiently and cost-effectively allocate capital to lower climate risk assets in line with its\ninvestment objectives); Credit Suisse (stating that the lack of consistent and reliable climate-related data has\ncreated significant challenges in the ability of financial market participants to adequately assess and compare\nthe performance of reporting companies, as well as efficiently allocate capital towards low-carbon solutions);\nand Norges Bank Investment Management (indicating their reliance on companies\u2019 climate-related data to\nassess their exposure to the effects of climate and how they manage climate-related risks and opportunities, and\nstating that the scope and quality of companies\u2019 climate-related disclosures varies significantly and that their\nclimate-related data is often incomplete and/or not comparable).\n416 See, e.g., letters from Amazon Watch and Rainforest Action Network; Dimensional; Friends of the Earth; and\nICCR.\n154\n\ndisclosure, particularly regarding Scope 3 emissions, which, for certain industries, can comprise\na majority of GHG emissions.417\nMany commenters recommended basing any GHG emissions disclosure requirement on\nthe GHG Protocol.418 Several of these commenters stated that the GHG Protocol\u2019s framework\nfor reporting GHG emissions, delineated as Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions, has become the\nglobally-accepted standard used by numerous companies for reporting their GHG emissions.419\nCommenters also indicated that a mandatory standard for reporting GHG emissions based on the\nGHG Protocol would help in producing consistent, comparable, and reliable climate-related\ninformation for investors.420 Some commenters also stated that mandating GHG emissions\npursuant to a standardized approach, such as the GHG Protocol, would help mitigate instances of\ngreenwashing.421\n417 See, e.g., letters from Ceres (\u201cIn land-intensive sectors, deforestation, forest degradation, and land-use change\nare important financial risks associated with climate change.

See also Section IV.C below for further discussion of the practice of greenwashing.\n155\n\nSome commenters indicated that the Commission should mandate disclosure of only\nScopes 1 and 2 emissions.422 Other commenters suggested limiting the mandatory disclosure of\nScope 3 emissions to registrants in certain industries,423 larger registrants, or when a registrant\u2019s\nScope 3 emissions comprise 40 percent of its total emissions.424 These commenters pointed to\ndifficulties in obtaining the necessary data from third parties and methodological uncertainties as\nreasons for limiting or not requiring disclosure of Scope 3 emissions. Other commenters and\nresearch support a requirement for disclosure of Scope 3 emissions that is independent of an\nindividual company\u2019s materiality assessment.425\nA few commenters stated that the Commission should require the disclosure of only\nScope 1 emissions.426 One commenter stated that this approach would be consistent with the\nGreenhouse Gas Reporting Program overseen by the EPA, which they stated requires the\ntracking of facility-level Scope 1 emissions from \u201clarge greenhouse gas emitters.\u201d427 Another\n422 See, e.g., letters from Acadian Asset Management LLC; American Bankers Association; American Exploration\nProduction Council (June 11, 2021); Seema Arora; Bank Policy Institute; Biotechnology Innovation\nOrganization; Business Roundtable (June 11, 2021); Cisco (June 11, 2021); Conning (June 11, 2021); CPP\nInvestments; Decatur Capital Management; Dimensional Fund Advisors; Ethic Inc.; Freeport-McMoran (June\n11, 2021); Harvard Management Company; Information Technology Industry Council; Institute of International\nBankers; Investment Adviser Association; Manulife Investment Management; PGIM; PIMCO; Real Estate\nRoundtable (June 9, 2021); Matthew Roling and Samantha Tirakian; SIFMA Asset Management Group; the\nVanguard Group, Inc.; and Walmart, Inc.\n423 See, e.g., letters from Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America (recommending requiring Scope\n3 disclosure from issuers in the financial, energy, transportation, materials and buildings, and agriculture, food,\nand forest products sectors; and Sens.

This commenter also\n428 See letter from Richard Love.\n429 See supra notes 412 and 413.\n430 See supra Section II.C and infra Section II.I.\n431 See, e.g., letters from PIMCO; State Street Global Advisors; Trillium Asset Management; and Wellington\nManagement Co.\n432 See Wellington Management Co.\n157\n\nindicated that Scopes 1 and 2 emissions information is more broadly available than Scope 3\nemissions data because of the challenges of collecting the latter data.\nAs previously mentioned, several large institutional investors and financial institutions,\nwhich collectively have trillions of dollars in assets under management, have formed initiatives\nand made commitments to achieve a net-zero economy by 2050, with interim targets set for\n2030.433 These initiatives further support the notion that investors currently need and use GHG\nemissions data to make informed investment decisions. These investors and financial institutions\nare working to reduce the GHG emissions of companies in their portfolios or of their\ncounterparties and need GHG emissions data to evaluate the progress made regarding their net-\nzero commitments and to assess any associated potential asset devaluation or loan default\nrisks.434 A company\u2019s GHG emissions footprint also may be relevant to investment or voting\ndecisions because it could impact the company\u2019s access to financing or signal potential changes\nin its financial planning as governments, financial institutions, and other investors make demands\nto reduce GHG emissions.\nWe also agree with commenters that basing the Commission\u2019s proposed GHG emissions\ndisclosure rules on concepts used in the GHG Protocol could help provide investors with\nconsistent, comparable, and reliable information about a registrant\u2019s GHG emissions.435 In this\nregard, we note that several studies have found that GHG emissions data prepared pursuant to the\n433 See supra Section I.C.1 (discussing, in particular, Climate Action 100+ and GFANZ).\n434 See, e.g., Climate Action 100+, The Three Asks.\n435 See supra note 420.\n158\n\nGHG Protocol have become the most commonly referenced measurements of a company\u2019s\nexposure to climate-related risks.436\nHowever, we are not proposing to adopt all of the features of the GHG Protocol into the\nCommission\u2019s proposed climate-related disclosure rules. As explained in greater detail below, in\none significant respect the proposed rules differ from the approach taken by the GHG Protocol\nregarding the methodology that a registrant would be required to use when calculating its GHG\nemissions. This difference better suits the U.S. financial reporting regime and the needs of\ninvestors.437 We recognize that the methodologies pertaining to the measurement of GHG\nemissions, particularly Scope 3 emissions, are evolving. While we expect that many registrants\nwould choose to follow the standards and guidance provided by the GHG Protocol when\ncalculating their GHG emissions, the proposed rules would not require registrants to do so.\nAllowing for some flexibility in the choice of GHG emissions methodologies would permit\nregistrants to adapt to new approaches, such as those pertaining to their specific industry, as they\nemerge.\nb. The Treatment of Scopes 1 and 2 Emissions Compared to Scope 3\nEmissions\nWe are proposing to require all registrants to disclose their Scopes 1 and 2 emissions.\nThose types of emissions result directly or indirectly from facilities owned or activities\ncontrolled by a registrant. The relevant data for calculating Scopes 1 and 2 emissions should be\n436 See, e.g., Kauffmann, C., C. T\u00e9bar Less and D. Teichmann (2012), Corporate Greenhouse Gas Emission\nReporting: A Stocktaking of Government Schemes, OECD Working Papers on International Investment,\n2012/01, OECD Publishing, at 8, available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k97g3x674lq-en (\u201cFor example, the\nuse of scope 1, 2, 3 to classify emissions as defined by the GHG Protocol has become common language and\npractice today.\u201d).\n437 See infra Section II.G.2 (discussing the proposed treatment for determining ownership or control for the\npurpose of setting a registrant\u2019s organizational boundaries when measuring its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions).\n159\n\nreasonably available to registrants, and the relevant methodologies are fairly well-developed.\nRegistrants with large stationary sources of emissions already report Scope 1 emissions data to\nthe EPA, and the EPA provides detailed methodologies for a range of industries with significant\nScope 1 emissions.438 The EPA also provides detailed guidance for the calculation of Scope 2\nemissions, which, although classified as \u201cindirect emissions,\u201d are generated by direct activities of\nthe registrant in using purchased energy.439\nUnlike Scopes 1 and 2 emissions, Scope 3 emissions typically result from the activities of\nthird parties in a registrant\u2019s value chain440 and thus collecting the appropriate data and\ncalculating these emissions would potentially be more difficult than for Scopes 1 and 2\nemissions. At the same time, in many cases Scope 3 emissions disclosure may be necessary to\npresent investors a complete picture of the climate-related risks\u0336\u2014particularly transition risks\u0336\u0336\u2014\nthat a registrant faces and how GHG emissions from sources in its value chain, which are not\nincluded in its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions, may materially impact a registrant\u2019s business\noperations and associated financial performance. Scope 3 emissions can augment the\ninformation provided in Scopes 1 and 2 emissions and help to reflect the total emissions\nassociated with a registrant\u2019s operations, including inputs from upstream activities, such as those\n438 See EPA, Direct Emissions from Stationary Combustion Sources (Dec. 2020), available at\nhttps://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/documents/stationaryemissions.pdf.\n439 See EPA, Indirect Emissions from Purchased Electricity (Dec. 2020), available at\nhttps://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/documents/electricityemissions.pdf.\n440 As previously mentioned, the proposed rules would define a registrant\u2019s value chain to mean the upstream and\ndownstream activities related to a registrant\u2019s operations. Upstream activities include activities that relate to the\ninitial stages of producing a good or service (e.g., materials sourcing, materials processing, and supplier\nactivities). Downstream activities include activities that relate to processing materials into a finished product\nand delivering it or providing a service to the end user (e.g., transportation and distribution, processing of sold\nproducts, use of sold products, end of life treatment of sold products, and investments). See proposed 17 CFR\n229.1500(t).\n160\n\nof its suppliers, and outputs from downstream activities, such as those involving the distribution,\nuse, and disposal of a registrant\u2019s products or services.441\nScope 3 emissions are indirect, but registrants can and do take steps to limit Scope 3\nemissions and the attendant risks. Although a registrant may not own or control the operational\nactivities in its value chain that produce Scope 3 emissions, it nevertheless may influence those\nactivities, for example, by working with its suppliers and downstream distributors to take steps to\nreduce those entities\u2019 Scopes 1 and 2 emissions (and thus help reduce the registrant\u2019s Scope 3\nemissions) and any attendant risks. As such, a registrant may be able to mitigate the challenges\nof collecting the data required for Scope 3 disclosure.442 Such data may reveal changes in a\nregistrant\u2019s Scope 3 emissions over time that could be informative for investors in discerning\nhow the registrant is managing transition risks. For example, a registrant could seek to reduce\nthe potential impacts on its business of its upstream emissions by choosing to purchase from\nmore GHG emission-efficient suppliers or by working with existing suppliers to reduce\nemissions. A registrant could also seek to reduce the potential impacts on its business of\ndownstream emissions by producing products that are more energy efficient or involve less GHG\nemissions when consumers use them, or by contracting with distributors that use shorter\ntransportation routes. Being able to compare Scope 3 emissions over time could thus be a\nvaluable tool for investors in tracking a registrant\u2019s progress in mitigating transition and other\nclimate-related risks.\n441 See, e.g., letter from Wellington Management Co.\n442 See, e.g., letter from Apple (referencing its 2021 Environmental Progress Report, available at\nhttps://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apple_Environmental_Progress_Report_2021.pdf, which states that\n109 suppliers across 24 countries have committed to manufacturing Apple products with 100 percent renewable\nenergy, and indicating Apple\u2019s development of detailed life cycle assessment models, which help the company\nidentify its top product component contributors of carbon emissions and facilitate its providing a comprehensive\naccount of its relevant Scope 3 emissions).\n161\n\nTo balance the importance of Scope 3 emissions with the potential relative difficulty in\ndata collection and measurement, the proposed rules would require disclosure of Scope 3\nemissions only if those emissions are material, or if the registrant has set a GHG emissions\nreduction target or goal that includes its Scope 3 emissions.443 As explained in greater detail\nbelow, this latter proposed disclosure requirement could assist investors in tracking the progress\nof the registrant toward reaching the target or goal so that investors can better understand\npotential associated costs.444\nConsistent with the Commission\u2019s definition of \u201cmaterial\u201d and Supreme Court precedent,\na registrant would be required to disclose its Scope 3 emissions if there is a substantial likelihood\nthat a reasonable investor would consider them important when making an investment or voting\ndecision.445 In articulating this materiality standard, the Supreme Court recognized that \u201c[d]oubts\nas to the critical nature\u201d of the relevant information \u201cwill be commonplace.\u201d But \u201cparticularly in\nview of the prophylactic purpose\u201d of the securities laws,\u201d and \u201cthe fact that the content\u201d of the\ndisclosure \u201cis within management\u2019s control, it is appropriate that these doubts be resolved in\nfavor of those the statute is designed to protect,\u201d namely investors.446\nWhen recommending that the Commission require the disclosure of Scope 3 emissions,\nsome commenters indicated that Scope 3 emissions represent the relatively large source of\noverall GHG emissions for many companies.447 Given their relative magnitude, we agree that,\n443 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(c)(1). As explained below, we are also proposing a safe harbor for Scope 3\ndisclosures. See infra Section II.G.3.\n444 See infra note 461 and accompanying text.\n445 See supra note 209.\n446 TSC Industries, Inc. v Northway, 426 U.S. at 448.\n447 See, e.g., letters from Apple; and WK Associates.\n162\n\nfor many registrants, Scope 3 emissions may be material to help investors assess the registrants\u2019\nexposure to climate-related risks, particularly transition risks,448 and whether they have\ndeveloped a strategy to reduce their carbon footprint in the face of regulatory, policy, and market\nconstraints.449\nScope 3 emissions information may be material in a number of situations to help\ninvestors gain a more complete picture of the transition risks to which a registrant may be\nexposed. In certain industries, a transition to lower-emission products or processes may already\nbe underway, triggered by existing laws or regulations, changes in weather, policy initiatives, a\nshift in consumer preferences, technological changes, or other market forces, such that financial\nrisks are reasonably foreseeable for registrants in those industries based on the emissions in their\nvalue chain. For example, some registrants may need to allocate capital to invest in lower\nemissions equipment. Investors thus need and use information about the full GHG emissions\nfootprint and intensity of a registrant to determine and compare how exposed a registrant is to the\nfinancial risks associated with any transition to lower-emission products.\nFor example, in the automobile industry, the vast majority of car manufacturers\u2019 GHG\nemissions footprint comes from tailpipe emissions of cars driven by customers, as compared to\n448 See, e.g., letter from Wellington Management Co.\n449 See Eric Rosenbaum, Climate experts are worried about the toughest carbon emissions for companies to\ncapture (Aug. 18, 2021) (\u201cScope 3 carbon emissions, or those not part of operations or under direct control,\nrepresent the majority of the carbon footprint for most companies, in some cases as high as 85% to 95%\u201d),\navailable at https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/18/apple-amazon-exxon-and-the-toughest-carbon-emissions-to-\ncapture.html#:~:text=Scope%203%20carbon%20emissions%2C%20or,as%2085%25%20to%2095%25.

Investors can use Scope 3 emissions data\nconcerning a car manufacturer\u2019s suppliers and the use of its sold products to assess whether a\n450 See, e.g., TCFD, Guidance on Metrics, Targets, and Transition Plans (Oct. 2021), Appendix 1, Figure A1-1\n(Importance of Scope 3 GHG Emissions in Certain Sectors) (showing that, for the automobiles and components\nsector, the majority of GHG emissions result from downstream product use), available at\nhttps://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/60/2021/07/2021-Metrics_Targets_Guidance-1.pdf.\n451 See, e.g., Coral Davenport, E.P.A.

As many financial institutions and investors begin to set\ntheir own GHG emissions reduction goals, they may consider the total GHG emissions footprint\nof companies that they finance or invest in to build portfolios to meet their goals.455 Financial\ninstitutions and investors may focus on Scopes 1 and 2 emissions for companies in some\nindustries, particularly for industries in which Scopes 1 and 2 represent the majority of\ncompanies\u2019 total GHG emissions footprint. For other industries, however, Scope 3 emissions\nrepresent a relatively significant portion of companies\u2019 total GHG footprint, and therefore may\nreflect a more complete picture of companies\u2019 exposure to transition risks than Scopes 1 and 2\nemissions alone. For oil and gas product manufacturers, for example, Scope 3 emissions are\nlikely to be material and thus necessary to an understanding of a registrant\u2019s climate-related\nrisks.\nWhen assessing the materiality of Scope 3 emissions, registrants should consider whether\nScope 3 emissions make up a relatively significant portion of their overall GHG emissions.\nWhile we are not proposing a quantitative threshold for determining materiality, we note that\nsome companies rely on, or support reliance on, a quantitative threshold such as 40 percent when\nassessing the materiality of Scope 3 emissions.456 However, even when Scope 3 emissions do\nnot represent a relatively significant portion of overall GHG emissions, a quantitative analysis\n455 See supra Section I.C.1.\n456 See, e.g., letter from Uber Technologies; see also TCFD, Guidance on Metrics, Targets, and Transition Plans,\nat note 40, citing SBTi, SBTi Criteria and Recommendations (Oct. 2021), available at\nhttps://sciencebasedtargets.org/resources/files/SBTi-criteria.pdf.\n165\n\nalone would not suffice for purposes of determining whether Scope 3 emissions are material.\nConsistent with the concept of materiality in the securities laws, this determination would\nultimately need to take into account the total mix of information available to investors, including\nan assessment of qualitative factors. Accordingly, Scope 3 emissions may make up a relatively\nsmall portion of a registrant\u2019s overall GHG emissions but still be material where Scope 3\nrepresents a significant risk, is subject to significant regulatory focus, or \u201cif there is a substantial\nlikelihood that a reasonable [investor] would consider it important.\u201d 457 Moreover, if a\nmateriality analysis requires a determination of future impacts, i.e., a transition risk yet to be\nrealized, then both the probability of an event occurring and its magnitude should be considered.\nEven if the probability of an adverse consequence is relatively low, if the magnitude of loss or\nliability is high, then the information in question may still be material.\nIf a registrant determines that its Scope 3 emissions are not material, and therefore not\nsubject to disclosure, it may be useful to investors to understand the basis for that determination.\nFurther, if a registrant determines that certain categories of Scope 3 emissions are material,\nregistrants should consider disclosing why other categories are not material. If, however, Scope\n3 emissions are material, then understanding the extent of a registrant\u2019s exposure to Scope 3\nemissions, and the choices it makes regarding them, would be important for investors when\nmaking investment or voting decisions.\nSeveral commenters stated that disclosure of a registrant\u2019s Scope 3 emissions is essential\nto making an informed investment decision because Scope 3 emissions can indicate a registrant\u2019s\n457 TSC Industries v. Northway, 426 U.S. at 449.\n166\n\nexposure to climate-related transition risks.458 For example, if policy changes lead to mandatory\nemissions reductions or carbon pricing, a registrant with high Scope 3 emissions could\nexperience higher costs in sourcing key inputs. Similarly, if consumer preferences change to\nfavor products that are less carbon intensive, a registrant could see a significant change in\ndemand for its products. Registrants that do not account for these risks, or make suboptimal\nchoices regarding them, could become less profitable in the future than registrants that\nacknowledge these risks and successfully mitigate them.459 Thus, Scope 3 emissions disclosure\ncould help convey to investors the potential financial risks facing a company related to any\ntransition to a lower carbon economy. With Scope 3 information disclosed, investors would be\nable to assess, in conjunction with reported financial information, how GHG emissions impact\nthe registrant\u2019s operations as well as its overall business strategy so that they can make more\ninformed investment or voting decisions.460\nDisclosure of Scope 3 emissions could also highlight instances where a registrant\nattempts to reduce its total Scopes 1 and 2 emissions by outsourcing carbon intensive activities.\nFor example, a registrant could contract out certain high-emissions production activities so that\nits own Scope 1 or 2 emissions are lower than a similar company that has retained direct\nownership and control over more of its production activities. Thus, Scope 3 emissions reporting\n458 See, e.g., letters from Confluence Philanthropy; Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment; Mirova US\nLLC; NY City Comptroller; and Wellington Management Co.\n459 See id.\n460 For example, registrants that choose to mitigate climate-related risks by undertaking research and development\nactivities to source inputs involving less GHG emissions might incur expenses in the short-term but could\nachieve potential long-term cost savings by implementing more energy-efficient production processes and\navoiding potential penalties imposed by regulation.\n167\n\ncould provide greater transparency and help preclude any efforts by registrants to obscure for\ninvestors the full magnitude of the climate-related risks associated with their GHG emissions.\nThe proposed rules would also require a registrant to disclose its Scope 3 emissions if it\nhas set a GHG emissions reduction target or goal that includes Scope 3 emissions.461 This\ndisclosure requirement would enable investors to understand the scale and scope of actions the\nregistrant may need to take to fulfill its commitment to reduce its Scope 3 emissions and the\npotential financial impact of that commitment on the registrant. It would also enable an investor\nto assess the registrant\u2019s strategy for meeting its Scope 3 emissions target or goal and its progress\ntowards that target or goal, which may affect the registrant\u2019s business.\nScope 3 emissions disclosures would help investors to understand and assess the\nregistrant\u2019s strategy. For example, Scope 3 emissions disclosures would allow an investor to\nbetter understand how feasible it would be for the registrant to achieve its targets through its\ncurrent strategy, to track the registrant\u2019s progress over time, and to understand changes the\nregistrant may make to its strategy, targets, or goals. Scope 3 emissions disclosures would thus\nbe important to evaluating the financial effects of the registrant\u2019s target or goal. In addition, this\ndisclosure could help prevent instances of greenwashing or other misleading claims concerning\nthe potential impact of Scope 3 emissions on a registrant\u2019s business because investors, and the\nmarket would have access to a quantifiable, trackable metric.\nA registrant\u2019s Scope 3 emissions disclosure, together with the proposed financial\nstatement metrics, would also enable an investor to assess the efficiency and efficacy of the\nregistrant\u2019s actions to achieve its target or goal (e.g., by comparing the registrant\u2019s expenditures\n461 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(c)(1).\n168\n\nor other investments in lower carbon transition activities from year to year with any\ncorresponding reduction in its Scope 3 emissions). If a registrant has a relatively ambitious\nScope 3 emissions target, but discloses little investment in transition activities in its financial\nstatements and little or no reduction in Scope 3 emissions from year to year, these disclosures\ncould indicate to investors that the registrant may need to make a large expenditure or significant\nchange to its business operations as it gets closer to its target date, or risk missing its\ntarget. Both potential outcomes could have financial ramifications for the registrant and,\naccordingly, investors.\nThe proposed disclosure requirement should also give investors the ability to evaluate\nwhether a registrant\u2019s target or goal and its plan for achieving that target or goal could have an\nadverse impact on the registrant. For example, an investor might conclude that the financial\ncosts of a registrant\u2019s plan would outweigh any benefits to the business, and factor that into how\nthe registrant\u2019s securities fit into the investor\u2019s own investment portfolio given the investor\u2019s risk\ntolerance and other investment goals. Thus, the objective of this disclosure is not to drive\ntargets, goals, plans, or conduct, but to provide investors with the tools to assess the implications\nof any targets, goals, or plans on the registrant in making investment or voting decisions.\nThis disclosure requirement could also enable investors to better compare firms. For\nexample, two registrants may have the same total GHG emissions and have made the same\ncommitments to reduce total GHG emissions from Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions combined.\nHowever, if the registrants have different proportions of emissions from Scope 1 and 2 versus\nScope 3, investors might determine that there would be different costs and effects for these\nregistrants from their disclosed plans to reduce their overall emissions.\n169\n\nScope 3 emissions disclosures could also enable investors to better compare registrants\u2019\nplans to achieve their Scope 3 emissions targets or goals. For example, registrants in the retail\nindustry may have a relatively large portion of their Scope 3 emissions derived from customer\ntravel to the registrant\u2019s stores and shipping products or goods to customers or stores. If a\nregistrant in this industry has set Scope 3 emissions targets or goals, in order to meet those\ntargets or goals it may choose to relocate its stores to be closer to public transportation. Another\nsimilarly situated registrant may elect to switch to using electric vehicles for shipping. A third\nsimilarly situated registrant might elect to take neither action, but instead assume Scope 3\nemissions reductions based on customers\u2019 change in behavior. Investors could assess the\nlikelihood of each of these three registrants meeting their Scope 3 emissions target or goal\u2014as\nwell as the likely financial and operational impact\u2014which could depend on the amount and type\nof their Scope 3 emissions. Investors could also compare the potential impacts of these plans on\nthe three different registrants. Without disclosures of the amount and type of Scope 3 emissions,\ninvestors would face difficulty assessing the likely impacts of a target or goal that includes Scope\n3 emissions on registrants and comparing the relative impacts across registrants.\nIf required to disclose Scope 3 emissions, a registrant would be required to identify the\ncategories of upstream and downstream activities that have been included in the calculation of its\nScope 3 emissions. Consistent with the GHG Protocol,462 the proposed rules identify several\ncategories of activities that can give rise to Scope 3 emissions. Upstream activities from which\nScope 3 emissions might result include:\n\u2022 A registrant\u2019s purchased goods and services;\n462 See WBCSD and World Resources Institute, Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3)\nAccounting and Reporting Standard (Sept. 2011).\n170\n\n\u2022 A registrant\u2019s capital goods;\n\u2022 A registrant\u2019s fuel and energy related activities not included in Scope 1 or Scope 2\nemissions;\n\u2022 Transportation and distribution of purchased goods, raw materials, and other inputs;\n\u2022 Waste generated in a registrant\u2019s operations;\n\u2022 Business travel by a registrant\u2019s employees;\n\u2022 Employee commuting by a registrant\u2019s employees; and\n\u2022 A registrant\u2019s leased assets related principally to purchased or acquired goods or\nservices.463\nDownstream activities from which Scope 3 emissions might result include:\n\u2022 Transportation and distribution of a registrant\u2019s sold products, goods or other outputs;\n\u2022 Processing by a third party of a registrant\u2019s sold products;\n\u2022 Use by a third party of a registrant\u2019s sold products;\n\u2022 End-of-life treatment by a third party of a registrant\u2019s sold products;\n\u2022 A registrant\u2019s leased assets related principally to the sale or disposition of goods or\nservices;\n\u2022 A registrant\u2019s franchises; and\n\u2022 Investments by a registrant.464\nThe list of upstream and downstream activities set forth in proposed Item 1500(r) is non-\nexclusive. If any upstream or downstream activities were significant to the registrant when\n463 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(r).\n464 See id. The \u201cinvestments\u201d category would capture what are commonly referred to as \u201cfinanced emissions.\u201d\n171\n\ncalculating its Scope 3 emissions, the proposed rules would require it to identify such categories\nand separately disclose Scope 3 emissions data for each of those categories together with a total\nof all Scope 3 emissions.465 For example, an energy company that produces oil and gas products\nmay find that a significant category of activity resulting in Scope 3 emissions relates to the end\nuse of its sold products. A manufacturer might find that a significant category of activities\nresulting in Scope 3 emissions relate to the emissions of its suppliers in the production of\npurchased goods or services, the processing of its sold products, or by the fuel consumed by its\nthird-party transporters and distributors of those goods and services and of its sold products. In\nsome cases, the category in which an emissions source belongs may be unclear, or the source\nmight fit within more than one category. In those cases, registrants would need to use their best\njudgment as to the description of the emissions source and provide sufficient transparency as to\nthe reasoning and methodology to facilitate investor understanding of the emissions category and\nsource.\nIf required to disclose Scope 3 emissions, a registrant would also be required to describe\nthe data sources used to calculate those emissions, including the use of any of the following:\n\u2022 Emissions reported by parties in the registrant\u2019s value chain, and whether such reports\nwere verified by the registrant or a third party, or unverified;\n\u2022 Data concerning specific activities,466 as reported by parties in the registrant\u2019s value\nchain; and\n465 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(c)(1).\n466 Activity data refers to a quantitative measure of a level of activity that results in GHG emissions. Depending on\nthe activity, such data could be expressed, for example, as: liters of fuel consumed; kilowatt-hours of electricity\nconsumed; kilograms of material consumed; kilometers of distance traveled; hours of time operated; square\nmeters of area occupied; kilograms of waste generated; kilograms of product sold; or quantity of money spent.\nSee GHG Protocol, Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard, Chapter 7.\n172\n\n\u2022 Data derived from economic studies, published databases, government statistics, industry\nassociations, or other third-party sources outside of a registrant\u2019s value chain, including\nindustry averages of emissions, activities, or economic data.467\nThis information is intended to assist investors in assessing the reliability and accuracy of\nthe registrant\u2019s Scope 3 emissions disclosure. For example, an investor might find emissions data\nrelated to the downstream transportation and distribution of a registrant\u2019s sold products more\nreliable if based on specific distances traveled by the registrant\u2019s transportation and distribution\npartners and company-specific emissions factors rather than estimates of distances traveled based\non industry-average data and using national average emission factors. Although we recognize that\na registrant may sometimes need to use industry- and national-average data when calculating its\nScope 3 emissions, information about the data sources for its Scope 3 emissions would help\ninvestors better understand the risk exposure posed by the registrant\u2019s value chain in comparison\nwith other registrants and make more informed investment decisions.\nWe acknowledge that a registrant\u2019s material Scope 3 emissions is a relatively new type of\nmetric, based largely on third-party data, that we have not previously required. We are\nproposing the disclosure of this metric because we believe capital markets have begun to assign\nfinancial value to this type of metric, such that it can be material information for investors about\nfinancial risks facing a company. Scope 3 emissions disclosure is an integral part of both the\nTCFD468 framework and the GHG Protocol,469 which are widely accepted. It also has been\nwidely recognized that, for some companies, disclosure of just Scopes 1 and 2 emissions could\n467 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(c)(2).\n468 See, e.g., TCFD, Guidance on Metrics, Targets, and Transition Plans (Oct. 2021), Appendix 1.\n469 See, e.g., GHG Protocol, Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard.\n173\n\nconvey an incomplete, and potentially misleading, picture.470 We have attempted to calibrate our\nproposal to balance investors\u2019 demand for this information with the current limitations of the\nScope 3 emissions data.\nWe also recognize, as discussed below, that the reporting of Scope 3 emissions may\npresent more challenges than the reporting of Scopes 1 and 2 emissions. But in light of the fact\nthat a GHG emissions reporting regime may be incomplete without the reporting of Scope 3\nemissions, we are proposing to include them, with an appropriate transition period and safe\nharbor, at the outset. Although we have not proposed to exclude specific upstream or downstream\nactivities from the scope of the proposed Scope 3 disclosure requirement, we have limited the\nproposed disclosure requirement to those value chain emissions that overall are material. We also\nhave not proposed a bright-line quantitative threshold for the materiality determination as\nsuggested by some commenters471 because whether Scope 3 emissions are material would depend\non the particular facts and circumstances, making it difficult to establish a \u201cone size fits all\u201d\nstandard.\nRequest for Comment\n93. How would investors use GHG emissions disclosures to inform their investment and\nvoting decisions? How would such disclosures provide insight into a registrant\u2019s financial\ncondition, changes in financial condition, and results of operations? How would such\ndisclosures help investors evaluate an issuer\u2019s climate risk-related exposure? Would such\n470 See, e.g., TCFD, Guidance on Metrics, Targets, and Transition Plans (Oct. 2021), Appendix 1; and letters from\nApple; NY City Comptroller; and Wellington Investment Co.\n471 See, e.g., letter from Catavento Consultancy (stating that Scope 3 emissions disclosure should be mandatory for\nlarger companies and for those in which Scope 3 emissions account for more than 40% of total emissions).\n174\n\ndisclosures enable investors to better assess physical risks associated with climate-related events,\ntransition risks, or both types of risks?\n94. Should we require a registrant to disclose its GHG emissions both in the aggregate, per\nscope, and on a disaggregated basis for each type of greenhouse gas that is included in the\nCommission\u2019s proposed definition of \u201cgreenhouse gases,\u201d as proposed? Should we instead\nrequire that a registrant disclose on a disaggregated basis only certain greenhouse gases, such as\nmethane (CH or hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), or only those greenhouse gases that are the most\n4)\nsignificant to the registrant? Should we require disaggregated disclosure of one or more\nconstituent greenhouse gases only if a registrant is obligated to separately report the individual\ngases pursuant to another reporting regime, such as the EPA\u2019s greenhouse gas reporting regime\nor any foreign reporting regime? If so, should we specify the reporting regime that would trigger\nthis disclosure?\n95. We have proposed defining \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d as a list of specific gases that aligns with\nthe GHG Protocol and the list used by the EPA and other organizations. Should other gases be\nincluded in the definition? Should we expand the definition to include any other gases to the\nextent scientific data establishes a similar impact on climate change with reasonable certainty?\nShould we require a different standard to be met for other greenhouse gases to be included in the\ndefinition?\n96. Should we require a registrant to express its emissions data in CO e, as proposed? If not,\n2\nis there another common unit of measurement that we should use? Is it important to designate a\ncommon unit of measurement for GHG emissions data, as proposed, or should we permit\nregistrants to select and disclose their own unit of measurement?\n175\n\n97. Should we require a registrant to disclose its total Scope 1 emissions and total Scope 2\nemissions separately for its most recently completed fiscal year, as proposed? Are there other\napproaches that we should consider?\n98. Should we require a registrant to disclose its Scope 3 emissions for the fiscal year if\nmaterial, as proposed? Should we instead require the disclosure of Scope 3 emissions for all\nregistrants, regardless of materiality? Should we use a quantitative threshold, such as a\npercentage of total GHG emissions (e.g., 25%, 40%, 50%) to require the disclosure of Scope 3\nemissions? If so, is there any data supporting the use of a particular percentage threshold?\nShould we require registrants in particular industries, for which Scope 3 emissions are a high\npercentage of total GHG emissions, to disclose Scope 3 emissions?\n99. Should we require a registrant that has made a GHG emissions reduction commitment\nthat includes Scope 3 emissions to disclose its Scope 3 emissions, as proposed? Should we\ninstead require registrants that have made any GHG emissions reduction commitments, even if\nthose commitments do not extend to Scope 3, to disclose their Scope 3 emissions? Should we\nonly require Scope 3 emissions disclosure if a registrant has made a GHG emissions reduction\ncommitment that includes Scope 3 emissions?\n100. Should Scope 3 emissions disclosure be voluntary? Should we require Scope 3\nemissions disclosure in stages, e.g., requiring qualitative disclosure of a registrant\u2019s significant\ncategories of upstream and downstream activities that generate Scope 3 emissions upon\neffectiveness of the proposed rules, and requiring quantitative disclosure of a registrant\u2019s Scope 3\nemissions at a later date? If so, when should we require quantitative disclosure of a registrant\u2019s\nScope 3 emissions?\n176\n\n101. Should we require a registrant to exclude any use of purchased or generated offsets\nwhen disclosing its Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions, as proposed? Should we require a\nregistrant to disclose both a total amount with, and a total amount without, the use of offsets for\neach scope of emissions?\n102. Should we require a registrant to disclose its Scope 3 emissions for each separate\nsignificant category of upstream and downstream emissions as well as a total amount of Scope 3\nemissions for the fiscal year, as proposed? Should we only require the disclosure of the total\namount of Scope 3 emissions for the fiscal year? Should we require the separate disclosure of\nScope 3 emissions only for certain categories of emissions and, if so, for which categories?\n103. Should the proposed rules include a different standard for requiring identification of the\ncategories of upstream and downstream emissions, such as if those categories of emissions are\nsignificant to total GHG emissions or total Scope 3 emissions? Are there any other categories of,\nor ways to categorize, upstream or downstream emissions that a registrant should consider as a\nsource of Scope 3 emissions? For example, should we require a registrant to disclose Scope 3\nemissions only for categories of upstream or downstream activities over which it has influence or\nindirect control, or for which it can quantify emissions with reasonable reliability? Are there any\nproposed categories of upstream or downstream emissions that we should exclude as sources of\nScope 3 emissions?\n104. Should we, as proposed, allow a registrant to provide their own categories of upstream\nor downstream activities? Are there additional categories, other than the examples we have\nidentified, that may be significant to a registrant\u2019s Scope 3 emissions and that should be listed in\nthe proposed rule? Are there any categories that we should preclude, e.g., because of lack of\naccepted methodologies or availability of data? Would it be useful to allow registrants to add\n177\n\ncategories that are particularly significant to them or their industry, such as Scope 3 emissions\nfrom land use change, which is not currently included in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol\u2019s Scope 3\ncategories? Should we specifically add an upstream emissions disclosure category for land use?\n105. Should we require the calculation of a registrant\u2019s Scope 1, Scope 2, and/or Scope 3\nemissions to be as of its fiscal year end, as proposed? Should we instead allow a registrant to\nprovide its GHG emissions disclosures according to a different timeline than the timeline for its\nExchange Act annual report? If so, what should that timeline be? For example, should we allow\na registrant to calculate its Scope 1, Scope 2, and/or Scope 3 emissions for a 12-month period\nending on the latest practicable date in its fiscal year that is no earlier than three months or,\nalternatively, six months prior to the end of its fiscal year? Would allowing for an earlier\ncalculation date alleviate burdens on a registrant without compromising the value of the\ndisclosure? Should we allow such an earlier calculation date only for a registrant\u2019s Scope 3\nemissions? Would the fiscal year end calculations required for a registrant to determine if Scope\n3 emissions are material eliminate the benefits of an earlier calculation date? Should we instead\nrequire a registrant to provide its GHG emissions disclosures for its most recently completed\nfiscal year one, two, or three months after the due date for its Exchange Act annual report in an\namendment to that report?\n106. Should we require a registrant that is required to disclose its Scope 3 emissions to\ndescribe the data sources used to calculate the Scope 3 emissions, as proposed? Should we\nrequire the proposed description to include the use of: (i) emissions reported by parties in the\nregistrant\u2019s value chain, and whether such reports were verified or unverified; (ii) data\nconcerning specific activities, as reported by parties in the registrant\u2019s value chain; and (iii) data\nderived from economic studies, published databases, government statistics, industry associations,\n178\n\nor other third-party sources outside of a registrant\u2019s value chain, including industry averages of\nemissions, activities, or economic data, as proposed? Are there other sources of data for Scope 3\nemissions the use of which we should specifically require to be disclosed? For purposes of our\ndisclosure requirement, should we exclude or prohibit the use of any of the proposed specified\ndata sources when calculating Scope 3 emissions and, if so, which ones?\n107. Should we require a registrant to provide location data for its disclosed sources of Scope\n1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions if feasible? If so, should the feasibility of providing location\ndata depend on whether it is known or reasonably available pursuant to the Commission\u2019s\nexisting rules (Securities Act Rule 409 and Exchange Act Rule 12b-21)? Would requiring\nlocation data, to the extent feasible, assist investors in understanding climate-related risks, and in\nparticular, likely physical risks, associated with a registrant\u2019s emissions\u2019 sources? Would a\nrequirement to disclose such location data be duplicative of any of the other disclosure\nrequirements that we are proposing?\n108. If we require a registrant to provide location data for its GHG emissions, how should\nthat data be presented? Should the emissions data be grouped by zip code separately for each\nscope? Should the disclosure be presented in a cartographic data display, such as what is\ncommonly known as a \u201cheat map\u201d? If we require a registrant to provide location data for its\nGHG emissions, should we also require additional disclosure about the source of the emissions?\nc. GHG Intensity\nIn addition to requiring the disclosure of its GHG emissions in gross terms, the proposed\nrules would also require a registrant to disclose the sum of its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions in terms\n179\n\nof GHG intensity.472 If required to disclose Scope 3 emissions, a registrant would also be\nrequired to separately disclose its Scope 3 emissions in terms of GHG intensity.473 GHG\nintensity disclosure should provide context to a registrant\u2019s emissions in relation to its business\nscale (e.g., emissions per economic output). For example, car manufacturer A may generate\nmore emissions in terms of CO e than car manufacturer B; however, when analyzing an intensity\n2\nmetric (emissions per unit of production), it becomes apparent that car manufacturer A actually\nhas a lower emission rate per car produced than car manufacturer B, which indicates a\nregistrant\u2019s emission efficiency. Because emission efficiency can be a potential indicator of the\nlikelihood of the registrant being impacted by transition risks, such GHG intensity disclosure\ncould provide decision-useful information to investors. In addition, the proposed GHG intensity\ndisclosure would provide a standardized method for presenting such measure of efficiency across\nregistrants, which should facilitate comparability of the registrant\u2019s emissions efficiency over\ntime.\nThe proposed rules would define \u201cGHG intensity\u201d (or \u201ccarbon intensity\u201d) to mean a ratio\nthat expresses the impact of GHG emissions per unit of economic value (e.g., metric tons of\nCO e per unit of total revenues, using the registrant\u2019s reporting currency) or per unit of\n2\nproduction (e.g., metric tons of CO e per unit of product produced).474 For purposes of\n2\nstandardizing the disclosure and facilitating its comparability, we are proposing to require the\ndisclosure of GHG intensity in terms of metric tons of CO e per unit of total revenue and per unit\n2\n472 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(d)(1).\n473 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(d)(2). The proposed safe harbor for Scope 3 emissions disclosure would apply\nto this proposed GHG intensity metric for Scope 3 emissions. See infra Section II.C.3.\n474 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(i). We derived this proposed definition from the GHG Protocol. See GHG\nProtocol, A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Chapter 9.\n180\n\nof production for the fiscal year.475 Total revenue is one of the most commonly used and\nunderstood financial metrics when investors analyze a registrant\u2019s financial results and applies to\nmost registrants (depending on the nature and maturity of the business) and therefore would be a\ngood common denominator for the intensity calculation. The selected unit of production should\nbe relevant to the registrant\u2019s industry to facilitate investor comparison of the GHG intensity of\ncompanies within an industry without regard to registrant size. Investors may find such a\ncomparison to be useful to making informed investment decisions to the extent that a registrant\nwithin a particular industry that has a lower GHG intensity relative to its peers that face fewer\nclimate-related risks.\nIf the registrant has no revenue for a fiscal year, it would be required to calculate its GHG\nintensity with another financial measure (e.g., total assets), with an explanation of why the\nparticular measure was used. Similarly, if the registrant does not have a unit of production, it\nwould be required to calculate its GHG intensity with another measure of economic output,\ndepending on the nature of its business (e.g., data processing capacity, volume of products sold,\nor number of occupied rooms) with an explanation of why the particular measure was used.476\nA registrant could also voluntarily disclose other additional measures of GHG intensity,\nincluding non-financial measures such as economic output, provided it includes an explanation\nof the reasons why those particular GHG intensity measures were used and why the registrant\nbelieves such measures provide useful information to investors.477 In all cases, the registrant\n475 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(d)(1).\n476 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(d)(3).\n477 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(d)(4).\n181\n\nwould be required to disclose the methodology and other information required pursuant to the\nproposed GHG emissions metrics instructions.478\nRequest for Comment\n109. Should we require a registrant to disclose the intensity of its GHG emissions for the\nfiscal year, with separate calculations for (i) the sum of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions and, if\napplicable (ii) its Scope 3 emissions (separately from Scopes 1 and 2), as proposed? Should we\ndefine GHG intensity, as proposed? Is there a different definition we should use for this\npurpose?\n110. Should we require the disclosed GHG intensity to be expressed in terms of metric tons\nof CO e per unit of total revenue, as proposed? Should we require a different financial measure\n2\nof GHG intensity and, if so, which measure? For example, should GHG intensity be expressed\nin terms of metric tons of CO e per unit of total assets?\n2\n111. Should we require the disclosed GHG intensity to be expressed in terms of metric tons\nof CO e per unit of production, as proposed? Would such a requirement facilitate the\n2\ncomparability of the disclosure? Should we require a different economic output measure of\nGHG intensity and, if so, which measure? For example, should GHG intensity be expressed in\nterms of metric tons of CO e per number of employees? Should we require the GHG intensity to\n2\nbe expressed per unit of production relevant to the registrant\u2019s business (rather than its industry)?\nIs further guidance needed on how to comply with the proposed requirement? Would requiring\nGHG intensity to be expressed in terms of metrics tons of CO e per unit of production require\n2\ndisclosure of commercially sensitive or competitively harmful information?\n478 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(e)(1) and infra Section II.G.2 for the proposed disclosure requirements\npertaining to GHG emissions methodology.\n182\n\n112. Should we require a registrant with no revenue or unit of production for a fiscal year to\ndisclose its GHG intensity based on, respectively, another financial measure or measure of\neconomic output, as proposed? Should we require such a registrant to use a particular financial\nmeasure, such as total assets, or a particular measure of economic output, such as total number of\nemployees? For registrants who may have minimal revenue, would the proposed calculation\nresult in intensity disclosure that is confusing or not material? Should additional guidance be\nprovided with respect to such instances?\n113. Should we permit a registrant to disclose other measures of GHG intensity, in addition\nto the required measures, as long as the registrant explains why it uses the particular measure of\nGHG intensity and discloses the corresponding calculation methodology used, as proposed?\nd. GHG Emissions Data for Historical Periods\nThe proposed rules would require disclosure to be provided for the registrant\u2019s most\nrecently completed fiscal year and for the historical fiscal years included in the registrant\u2019s\nconsolidated financial statements in the applicable filing, to the extent such historical GHG\nemissions data is reasonably available.479 Requiring historical GHG emissions data, to the extent\navailable, would provide useful information for investors by enabling investors to track over time\nthe registrant\u2019s exposure to climate-related impacts represented by the yearly emissions data, and\nto assess how it is managing the climate-related risks associated with those impacts. Requiring\nGHG emissions disclosure for current and, when reasonably available, historical periods should\nenable investors to analyze trends in the impacts of material climate-related risks and to evaluate\nthe narrative disclosure provided pursuant to proposed Item 1502.480 Historical GHG emissions\n479 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(a).\n480 See supra Section II.C for a discussion of proposed 17 CFR 229.1502.\n183\n\ndata also could be particularly useful when a registrant has announced a target or goal for\nreducing GHG emissions by a certain date by helping investors assess its progress in meeting\nthat target or goal and the related impacts on the registrant.\nLinking the required number of years of historical GHG emissions data to the historical\nperiods required in the consolidated financial statements should benefit investors by requiring\nemissions data that is consistent with the financial statement metrics in the filing. This should\nhelp investors connect GHG emissions with the financial performance of a registrant in the same\nperiod, including the proposed financial statement metrics. Moreover, although we are not\nproposing to require the GHG emissions data to be included in the registrant\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial statements, we nevertheless believe that the GHG emissions data is relevant to, and\nwould be read in conjunction with, information included in the consolidated financial statements.\nJust as data about a registrant\u2019s revenues and expenses on its income statement reflect its\nactivities in financial terms for a given year, a registrant\u2019s emissions data reflect its carbon\nfootprint activities for that year. For this reason, we have proposed requiring a registrant to\nprovide its GHG emissions data for the same number of years as it is required to provide data on\nits income statement and cash flow statement, to the extent such emissions data is reasonably\navailable. For example, a registrant that is required to include income statements and cash flow\nstatements at the end of its three most recent fiscal years would be required to disclose three\nyears of its Scope 1, Scope 2 and, if material to the registrant or if it has set a GHG emissions\ntarget or goal that includes its Scope 3 emissions, its Scope 3 emissions, expressed both in\n184"

Should we require GHG emissions disclosure for the registrant\u2019s most recently\ncompleted fiscal year and for the appropriate, corresponding historical fiscal years included\nin the registrant\u2019s consolidated financial statements in the filing, to the extent such historical\nGHG emissions data is reasonably available, as proposed? Should we instead only require\nGHG emissions metrics for the most recently completed fiscal year presented in the relevant\nfiling? Would requiring historical GHG emissions metrics provide important or material\ninformation to investors, such as information allowing them to analyze trends?\n2. GHG Emissions Methodology and Related Instructions\nThe proposed rules would require a registrant to describe the methodology, significant\ninputs, and significant assumptions used to calculate its GHG emissions metrics.484 As proposed,\nthe description of the registrant\u2019s methodology must include the registrant\u2019s organizational\n481 Alternatively, if a registrant has no revenue, and it decides to calculate GHG intensity using total assets, we\nbelieve it would be appropriate for that registrant to provide its GHG intensity for the same number of years as\nare required on its balance sheets (i.e., two years if not a SRC).\n482 We are proposing to exempt SRCs from Scope 3 disclosures. See infra Section II.G.3.\n483 See Securities Act Rule 409 and Exchange Act Rule 12b-21.\n484 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(e)(1).\n185\n\nboundaries, operational boundaries, calculation approach, and any calculation tools used to\ncalculate the registrant\u2019s GHG emissions.485 Organizational boundaries would be defined to\nmean the boundaries that determine the operations owned or controlled by a registrant for the\npurpose of calculating its GHG emissions.486 Operational boundaries would be defined to mean\nthe boundaries that determine the direct and indirect emissions associated with the business\noperations owned or controlled by a registrant.487 This information should help investors\nunderstand the scope of a registrant\u2019s operations included in its GHG emissions metrics and how\nthose metrics were measured. With this information, investors could more knowledgeably\ncompare a registrant\u2019s GHG emissions metrics with the GHG emissions metrics of other\nregistrants and make more informed investment decisions.\na. The Setting and Disclosure of Organizational Boundaries\nThe proposed rules would require a registrant to disclose its Scope 1 emissions and its\nScope 2 emissions separately after calculating them from all sources that are included in the\nregistrant\u2019s organizational and operational boundaries.488 An initial step for many registrants\nmay be to set their organizational boundaries.489 Those boundaries determine the business\noperations owned or controlled by a registrant to be included in the calculation of its GHG\nemissions.490 Because both Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions relate to the operations owned or\n485 See id.\n486 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(m).\n487 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(l).\n488 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(b)(1).\n489 See GHG Protocol, Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Chapter 3.\n490 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(m).\n186\n\ncontrolled by a registrant, setting a registrant\u2019s organizational boundaries is an important part of\ndetermining its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions.\nSeveral commenters stated that the GHG Protocol\u2019s standards and guidance would\nprovide an appropriate framework for reporting GHG emissions if the Commission required\ndisclosure of GHG emissions.491 A company following the GHG Protocol would base its\norganizational boundaries on either an equity share approach or a control approach.492 Our\nproposed approach, however, would require a registrant to set the organizational boundaries for\nits GHG emissions disclosure using the same scope of entities, operations, assets, and other\nholdings within its business organization as those included in, and based upon the same set of\naccounting principles applicable to, its consolidated financial statements.493\nFor similar reasons to those noted above regarding the proposed time periods required for\nGHG emissions disclosure, we propose requiring the scope of consolidation and reporting to be\nconsistent for financial data and GHG emissions data. This would be accomplished by applying\nexisting GAAP.494 Requiring a consistent approach should help avoid potential investor\nconfusion about the reporting scope used in determining a registrant\u2019s GHG emissions and the\nreporting scope used for the financial statement metrics, which are included in the financial\nstatements. Applying existing GAAP could help limit the compliance burden for registrants as\n491 See supra note 111.\n492 Under the GHG Protocol\u2019s equity share approach, a company accounts for GHG emissions from operations\naccording to its share of equity in the operation. Under the GHG Protocol\u2019s control approach, a company\naccounts for 100% of the GHG emissions from operations over which it has control. A company can choose to\ndefine control either in financial or operational terms. See GHG Protocol, Corporate Accounting and Reporting\nStandard, Chapter 3.\n493 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(e)(2).\n494 Foreign private issuers that file consolidated financial statements under IFRS as issued by the IASB would\napply IFRS under the proposed rules as the basis for setting its organizational boundaries for the purpose of\nproviding the proposed GHG emissions disclosure.\n187\n\nthey would be able to use familiar concepts from financial reporting when preparing their\nrequired GHG emissions disclosures. Requiring registrants to follow the scope of reporting used\nin their financial statements should also enhance comparability across registrants when compared\nwith the multiple options available under the GHG Protocol.\nThus, as proposed, the scope of reporting for a registrant\u2019s GHG emissions metrics would\nbe consistent with the scope of reporting for the proposed financial statement metrics and other\nfinancial data included in its consolidated financial statements in order to provide investors a\nconsistent view of the registrant\u2019s business across its financial and GHG emissions disclosures.\nFor example, a registrant that prepares its financial statements pursuant to U.S. GAAP would\napply relevant guidance from U.S. GAAP (e.g., FASB ASC Topic 810 Consolidation and FASB\nASC Topic 323 Investments \u2013Equity Method and Joint Ventures) when determining which\nentities would be subject to consolidation or which investments qualify for equity method\naccounting or proportionate consolidation.495 Therefore, under the proposed rules a registrant\nwould be required to include all of the emissions from an entity that it consolidates.496 For an\nequity method investee or an operation that is proportionally consolidated, the registrant would\nbe required to include its share of emissions based on its percentage ownership of such investee\nor operation.497 For a registrant that applies the equity method to an investee, the percentage of\nownership interest used to record its share of earnings or losses in the investee must be the same\n495 Issuers that are permitted to, and do, apply IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board would\napply the IASB\u2019s equivalent standards. See, e.g., IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11 Joint\nArrangements and International Accounting Standards (\u201cIAS\u201d) 28 Investments in Associates and Joint\nVentures. See supra note 319, which states that foreign private issuers that file consolidated financial\nstatements under home country GAAP and reconcile to U.S. GAAP, would be required to use U.S. GAAP as\nthe basis for calculating and disclosing the proposed climate-related financial statement metrics. The same\nrequirement would apply for the purpose of determining the proposed GHG emissions metrics.\n496 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(e)(2).\n497 See id.\n188\n\nfor measuring its share of GHG emissions by the equity method investee.498 The proposed rules\nwould permit a registrant to exclude emissions from investments that are not consolidated, are\nnot proportionately consolidated, or that do not qualify for the equity method of accounting in\nthe registrant\u2019s consolidated financial statements.499\nFor example, a registrant might own or control several plants but have only a minority\nownership in another plant over which it has no control. For the plants that are owned or\ncontrolled by the registrant, all of those plants\u2019 direct and indirect emissions should be included\nin its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosure (regardless of ownership percentage that resulted in\nconsolidation for financial statement purposes).500 If the registrant\u2019s proportional interest in the\nlatter plant is reflected in its consolidated financial statements (e.g., the investment qualifies for\nthe equity method or a proportionate consolidation approach), when calculating its Scopes 1 and\n2 emissions the registrant should include such proportional share (based on ownership interest)\nof that plant\u2019s emissions in the total of each of its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions.501\nA related provision under the proposed rules would require a registrant to use the same\norganizational boundaries when calculating its Scope 1 emissions and Scope 2 emissions502 since\nboth sets of emissions relate to operations that a registrant owns or controls. If required to\ndisclose its Scope 3 emissions, a registrant would also be required to apply the same\norganizational boundaries used when determining its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions as an initial step\n498 See id.\n499 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(b)(2).\n500 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(m) (defining organizational boundaries as the boundaries that determine the\noperations owned or controlled by a registrant) and 17 CFR 229.1504(b)(1) (requiring the disclosure of Scopes\n1 and 2 emissions separately after calculating them from all sources included in a registrant\u2019s organizational and\noperational boundaries).\n501 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(e)(2).\n502 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(e)(3).\n189\n\nin identifying the sources of indirect emissions from activities in its value chain over which it\nlacks ownership and control and which must be included in the calculation of its Scope 3\nemissions.503 Requiring a registrant to use the same organizational boundaries when calculating\nits Scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions should help limit investor confusion over those operations or\nactivities over which it has ownership or control (sources of its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions) and\nthose activities in its value chain over which it lacks ownership or control (sources of its Scope 3\nemissions). The proposed provision also would provide that, once a registrant has determined its\norganizational (and operational) boundaries, it must consistently use those boundaries when\ncalculating its GHG emissions.504 This proposed provision should help investors track and\ncompare a registrant\u2019s GHG emissions over time.\nb. The Setting and Disclosure of Operational Boundaries\nWhen describing the methodology, significant inputs, and significant assumptions used to\ncalculate its GHG emissions metrics, a registrant is required to describe its operational\nboundaries.505 This would involve identifying emissions sources within its plants, offices, and\nother operational facilities that fall within its organizational boundaries, and then categorizing\nthe emissions as either direct or indirect emissions. For example, a registrant might have direct\nemissions from one or more of the following sources that it owns or controls:\n\u2022 Stationary equipment (from the combustion of fuels in boilers, furnaces, burners,\nturbines, heaters, and incinerators);\n503 See id.\n504 See id.\n505 See proposed Item 1504(e)(1).\n190\n\n\u2022 Transportation (from the combustion of fuels in automobiles, trucks, buses, trains,\nairplanes, boats, ships, and other vessels);\n\u2022 Manufacturing processes (from physical or chemical processes, such as CO from the\n2\ncalcination process in cement manufacturing or from catalytic cracking in petrochemical\nprocessing, and PFC emissions from aluminum smelting); and\n\u2022 Fugitive emission sources (equipment leaks from joints, seals, packing, gaskets, coal\npiles, wastewater treatment, pits, cooling towers, and gas processing facilities, and other\nunintentional releases).506\nMost registrants would likely have emission sources from stationary equipment and\ntransportation devices. Registrants in certain industrial sectors, such as cement, aluminum, and\nother manufacturers, or oil and gas production and refining, are likely also to produce emissions\nfrom physical or chemical processes. Some registrants would likely have emissions from all four\ntypes of sources, particularly if they have their own power generation or waste treatment\nfacilities.507\nThe proposed rules would require a registrant to include its approach to categorizing its\nemissions and emissions sources when describing its methodology to determine its operational\nboundaries.508 A registrant could use the above non-exclusive list of emissions sources or other\ncategories of emissions sources as long as it describes how it determined the emissions to include\nas direct emissions, for the purpose of calculating its Scope 1 emissions, and indirect emissions,\n506 This non-exclusive list of possible emissions sources is based on categories of emissions sources provided in the\nGHG Protocol. See GHG Protocol, Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Chapter 6.\n507 See id.\n508 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(e)(1).\n191\n\nfor the purpose of calculating its Scope 2 emissions.509 For most registrants, purchased\nelectricity would likely constitute a large percentage of their Scope 2 emissions. Although Scope\n2 emissions are generated from a source external to a registrant, the electricity (or steam, heat, or\ncooling) is consumed by the registrant\u2019s operations that it owns or controls.\nc. The Selection and Disclosure of a GHG Emissions Calculation\nApproach, including Emission Factors\nIn addition to setting its organizational and operational boundaries, a registrant would\nneed to select a GHG emissions calculation approach. While the direct measurement of GHG\nemissions from a source by monitoring concentration and flow rate is likely to yield the most\naccurate calculations, due to the expense of the direct monitoring of emissions, an acceptable and\ncommon method for calculating emissions involves the application of published emission factors\nto the total amount of purchased fuel consumed by a particular source.510 The proposed rules\nwould define \u201cemission factor\u201d as a multiplication factor allowing actual GHG emissions to be\ncalculated from available activity data or, if no activity data is available, economic data, to derive\nabsolute GHG emissions.511 Emission factors are ratios that typically relate GHG emissions to a\nproxy measure of activity at an emissions source. Examples of activity data reflected in emission\nfactors include kilowatt-hours of electricity used, quantity of fuel used, output of a process, hours\nof operation of equipment, distance travelled, and floor area of a building.512 If no activity data\nis available, a registrant may use an emission factor based on economic data.513 For example,\n509 See id.\n510 See, e.g., GHG Protocol, Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Chapter 6.\n511 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(e).\n512 See id.\n513 See id.\n192\n\nwhen calculating Scope 3 emissions from purchased goods or services, a registrant could\ndetermine the economic value of the goods or services purchased and multiply it by an industry\naverage emission factor (expressed as average emissions per monetary value of goods or\nservices).514\nThe EPA has published a set of emission factors based on the particular type of source\n(e.g., stationary combustion, mobile combustion, refrigerants, and electrical grid, among others)\nand type of fuel consumed (e.g., natural gas, coal or coke, crude oil, and kerosene, among many\nothers).515 The GHG Protocol\u2019s own set of GHG emission calculation tools are based in part on\nthe EPA\u2019s emission factors.516 Whatever set of emission factors a registrant chooses to use, it\nmust identify the emission factors and its source.517\nAfter a registrant has selected a calculation approach (i.e., direct measurement or\napplication of emissions factors), the registrant would determine what data must be collected and\nhow to conduct the relevant calculations, including whether to use any publicly-available\ncalculation tools. In this regard, we note that there are a number of publicly-available calculation\n514 See, e.g., Greenhouse Gas Protocol, Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard,\nSupplement to the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Chapter 1 (describing the\n\u201cspend-based method\u201d for calculating emissions from purchased goods or services).\n515 See EPA, Emission Factors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories (Apr. 2021), available at\nhttps://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2021-04/documents/emission-factors_apr2021.pdf.\n516 See, e.g., The Greenhouse Gas Protocol, GHG Emission Calculation Tool (Mar. 2021), available at\nhttps://ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools.\n517 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(e)(1).\n193\n\ntools a registrant may elect to utilize in determining its GHG emissions.518 Finally, a registrant\nwould gather and report GHG emissions up to the corporate level.\nFor example, when determining its Scope 1 emissions for a particular plant, a registrant\nmight add up the amount of natural gas consumed by furnaces and other stationary equipment\nduring its most recently completed fiscal year and then apply the CO emission factor for natural\n2\ngas to that total amount to derive the amount of GHG emissions expressed in CO e. The\n2\nregistrant would repeat this process for each type of fuel consumed and for each type of source.\nIf a registrant owns a fleet of trucks, it might total the amount of diesel fuel or other type of\ngasoline consumed for the fiscal year and apply the appropriate CO emission factor for that\n2\nvehicle and type of fuel. A registrant that uses refrigerants also might apply the appropriate\nemission factor for the particular type of refrigerant to the total amount of that refrigerant used\nduring the fiscal year. As part of the roll-up process for a registrant with multiple entities and\nemission sources, once it has determined the amount of CO e for each type of direct emissions\n2\nsource and for each facility within its organizational and operational boundaries, the registrant\nwould then add them together to derive the total amount of Scope 1 emissions for the fiscal\nyear.519\n518 See, e.g., GHG Protocol, Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Chapter 6 (providing an overview of\ncalculation tools by type of source (e.g., for stationary combustion, mobile combustion, and air conditioning and\nrefrigeration use) and by sector (e.g., for aluminum production, iron and steel production, cement\nmanufacturing, and pulp and paper production), which are available on the GHG Protocol website at\nhttps://ghgprotocol.org/. The EPA also has published a Simplified GHG Emissions Calculator that is designed\nas a simplified calculation tool to help small businesses and low emitter organizations estimate and inventory\ntheir annual GHG emissions. See EPA, Simplified GHG Emissions Calculator (2021), available at\nhttps://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/simplified-ghg-emissions-calculator.\n519 As noted earlier, a registrant that is required to report its direct emissions to the EPA may be able to use the\nEPA-provided data, together with data for any direct emissions not reported to the EPA, to help fulfill the\nCommission\u2019s proposed Scope 1 emission disclosure requirement.\n194\n\nA registrant would undergo a similar process when calculating its Scope 2 emissions for\nits most recently completed fiscal year. There are two common methods for calculating Scope 2\nemissions for purchased electricity: the market-based method and the location-based method.520\nPursuant to the market-based method, a registrant would calculate its Scope 2 emissions based\non emission factors and other data provided by the generator of electricity from which the\nregistrant has contracted to purchase the electricity and which are included in the contractual\ninstruments. Pursuant to the location-based method, a registrant would calculate its Scope 2\nemissions based on average energy generation emission factors for grids located in defined\ngeographic locations, including local, subnational, or national boundaries.521 A registrant could\nuse either of these methods, both methods, a combination, or another method as long as it\nidentifies the method used and its source.522 For example, if using the location-based method,\nthe registrant would apply an appropriate emission factor for the electricity grid in its region to\nthe total amount of electricity purchased from that grid during its fiscal year.523 The registrant\nwould then calculate the amount of CO e from purchased steam/heat, if any, by applying the\n2\nappropriate emission factor for that type of energy source to the total amount consumed.524 The\n520 See World Resources Institute, GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance (2015), Chapter 4, available at\nhttps://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards/Scope%202%20Guidance_Final_Sept26.pdf.\n521 See id.\n522 We note that, pursuant to the GHG Protocol, and as referenced by the EPA, a company that determines its\nScope 2 emissions using a market-based approach would also calculate those emissions using the location-based\nmethod to provide a more complete picture of the company\u2019s Scope 2 emissions. See World Resources\nInstitute, GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, Chapter 7; and EPA Center for Corporate Climate Leadership,\nScope 1 and Scope 2 Inventory Guidance.\n523 See, e.g., EPA, Emission Factors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories, Table 6, which provides emission factors for\nregional electrical grids.\n524 See, e.g., EPA, Emission Factors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories, Table 7, which provides emission factors for\nsteam and heat.\n195\n\nregistrant would report the sum of its CO e from purchased electricity and steam/heat as its total\n2\nScope 2 emissions for the fiscal year.\nAs noted above, in all instances a registrant would be required to describe its\nmethodology, including its organizational and operational boundaries, calculation approach\n(including any emission factors used and the source of the emission factors), and any calculation\ntools used to calculate the GHG emissions.525 Requiring a registrant to describe its methodology\nfor determining its GHG emissions should provide investors with important information to assist\nthem in evaluating the registrant\u2019s GHG emissions disclosure as part of its overall business and\nfinancial disclosure. Such disclosure should enable investors to evaluate the reasonableness and\naccuracy of the emission disclosures, and should promote consistency and comparability over\ntime. For example, an investor would be able to evaluate both if the registrant\u2019s selection of an\nemission factor is reasonable given the registrant\u2019s industry sector and whether changes in\nreported emissions reflect changes in actual emissions in accordance with its strategy or simply a\nchange in calculation methodology.\nLike registrants in other sectors, registrants in the financial sector would be required to\ndisclose their Scope 3 emissions if those emissions are material and to describe the methodology\nused to calculate those emissions. A financial registrant\u2019s Scope 3 emissions disclosures would\nlikely include the emissions from companies that the registrant provides debt or equity financing\nto (\u201cfinanced emissions\u201d). While financial registrants may use any appropriate methodology to\ncalculate its Scope 3 emissions, the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials\u2019 Global GHG\nAccounting & Reporting Standard (the \u201cPCAF Standard\u201d) provides one methodology that\n525 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(e)(1).\n196\n\ncomplements the GHG Protocol and assists financial institutions in calculating their financed\nemissions.526 The PCAF Standard was developed to work with the calculation of Scope 3\nemissions for the \u201cinvestment\u201d category of downstream emissions and was endorsed by the\ndrafters of the GHG Protocol.527 The PCAF Standard covers six asset classes: listed equity and\ncorporate bonds; business loans and unlisted equity; project finance; commercial real estate;\nmortgages; and motor vehicle loans.528\nAt this time, we are not proposing to require a particular methodology for the financial\nsector in order to provide a financial sector registrant the flexibility to choose the methodology\nthat best suits its particular portfolio and financing activities. We believe the proposed\nrequirement to disclose the methodology used (e.g., the PCAF Standard or another standard)\nwould provide sufficient information to an investor.\nd. Additional Rules Related to Methodology Disclosure\nWe are proposing additional rules related to the methodology for calculating GHG\nemissions. Some of these rules would apply generally to the determination of GHG emissions\nwhile some would apply specifically to the calculation of Scope 3 emissions. For example, one\nproposed rule would provide that a registrant may use reasonable estimates when disclosing its\nGHG emissions as long as it also describes the assumptions underlying, and its reasons for using,\n526 See PCAF, Global GHG Accounting & Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry (2020), available at\nhttps://carbonaccountingfinancials.com/files/downloads/PCAF-Global-GHG-Standard.pdf .\n527 See id. See also GHG Protocol Press Release, New Standard Developed to Help Financial Industry Measure\nand Report Emissions (Mar. 2021), available at https://ghgprotocol.org/blog/new-standard-developed-help-\nfinancial-industry-measure-and-report-emissions.\n528 While the guidance provided by the PCAF Standard for each asset class differs in certain respects, the PCAF\nStandard applies a common set of principles across the various asset classes. A key principle is that the GHG\nemissions from a client\u2019s activities financed by loans or investments attributable to the reporting financial\ninstitution should be allocated to that institution based on its proportional share of lending or investment in the\nborrower or investee through the application of an \u201cattribution factor.\u201d See PCAF, Global GHG Accounting &\nReporting Standard for the Financial Industry (2020), Sections 4.2 and 5.\n197\n\nthe estimates.529 While we encourage registrants to provide as accurate a measurement of its\nGHG emissions as is reasonably possible, we recognize that, in many instances, direct\nmeasurement of GHG emissions at the source, which would provide the most accurate\nmeasurement, may not be possible.\nSeveral commenters indicated that a registrant may find it difficult to complete its GHG\nemissions calculations for its most recently completed fiscal year in time to meet its disclosure\nobligations for that year\u2019s Exchange Act annual report.530 The proposed rules would permit a\nregistrant to use a reasonable estimate of its GHG emissions for its fourth fiscal quarter if no\nactual reported data is reasonably available, together with actual, determined GHG emissions\ndata for its first three fiscal quarters when disclosing its GHG emissions for its most recently\ncompleted fiscal year, as long as the registrant promptly discloses in a subsequent filing any\nmaterial difference between the estimate used and the actual, determined GHG emissions data\nfor the fourth fiscal quarter.531 We believe that this proposed provision would help address the\nconcerns of commenters about the timely completion of both the work required to disclose a\nregistrant\u2019s GHG emissions as of its fiscal year-end and to meet its other Exchange Act annual\nreporting obligations.532\nAnother proposed provision would require a registrant to disclose, to the extent material\nand as applicable, any use of third-party data when calculating its GHG emissions, regardless of\n529 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(e)(4).\n530 See, e.g., letters from Cisco; Dow; Energy Infrastructure Council; National Mining Association; Newmont\nCorporation; and United Airlines Holdings, Inc.\n531 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(e)(4)(i). One commenter made a similar recommendation when stating that a\nregistrant should be required to follow the same timeline for disclosure of its GHG emissions as for its\nExchange Act annual reporting obligations. See letter from Pricewaterhouse Coopers.\n532 See supra note 530.\n198\n\nthe particular scope of emissions.533 While this proposed provision would be most relevant to\nthe disclosure of Scope 3 emissions, where the use of third-party data is common, it would apply\nin other instances when third-party data is material to the GHG emissions determination, such as\nwhen determining Scope 2 emissions using contractual, supplier-provided emission factors for\npurchased electricity. When disclosing the use of third-party data, a registrant would be required\nto identify the source of the data and the process the registrant undertook to obtain and assess\nsuch data.534 This information would help investors better understand the basis for, and assess\nthe reasonableness of, the GHG emissions determinations and, accordingly, evaluate the GHG\ndisclosures as part of a registrant\u2019s business and financial information.\nOne proposed provision would require a registrant to disclose any material change to the\nmethodology or assumptions underlying its GHG emissions disclosure from the previous fiscal\nyear.535 For example, if a registrant uses a different set of emission factors, or develops a more\ndirect method of measuring GHG emissions, which results in a material change to the GHG\nemissions produced from the previous year under (or assuming) the same organizational and\noperational boundaries, it would be required to report that change. This should help investors\nmore knowledgeably compare the emissions data from year to year and better understand the\nnature and significance of a material change in emissions (i.e., was the change primarily due to\nan implementation of strategy or a change in methodology).\n533 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(e)(5).\n534 See id.\n535 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(e)(6).\n199\n\nAnother proposed provision would require a registrant to disclose, to the extent material\nand as applicable, any gaps in the data required to calculate its GHG emissions.536 This proposed\nprovision would be particularly relevant to a registrant\u2019s Scope 3 emissions. While a registrant\u2019s\nGHG emissions disclosure should provide investors with a reasonably complete understanding of\nthe registrant\u2019s GHG emissions in each scope of emissions, as previously noted, we recognize\nthat a registrant may encounter data gaps, particularly when calculating its Scope 3 emissions.\nThe proposed provision would require the registrant to disclose the data gaps and discuss\nwhether it used proxy data or another method to address such gaps. A registrant would also be\nrequired to discuss how its accounting for any data gaps has affected the accuracy or\ncompleteness of its GHG emissions disclosure.537 This information should help investors\nunderstand certain underlying uncertainties and limitations, and evaluate the corresponding\nreliability, of a registrant\u2019s GHG emissions disclosure, particularly for its Scope 3 emissions, as\npart of their assessment of the registrant\u2019s business and financial information.\nOne proposed provision would provide that, when determining whether its Scope 3\nemissions are material, and when disclosing those emissions, in addition to emissions from\nactivities in its value chain, a registrant must include GHG emissions from outsourced activities\nthat it previously conducted as part of its own operations, as reflected in the financial statements\nfor the periods covered in the filing.538 This proposed approach, which is consistent with the\nGHG Protocol,539 would help ensure that investors receive a complete picture of a registrant\u2019s\n536 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(e)(7).\n537 See id.\n538 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(e)(8).\n539 See Greenhouse Gas Protocol, Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard,\nSupplement to the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Chapter 6.\n200\n\ncarbon footprint by precluding the registrant from excluding emissions from activities that are\ntypically conducted as part of operations over which it has ownership or control but that are\noutsourced in order to reduce its Scopes 1 or 2 emissions.\nAnother proposed provision would provide that, if a registrant is required to disclose\nScope 3 emissions, and if there was any significant overlap in the categories of activities\nproducing the Scope 3 emissions, the registrant must describe the overlap, how it accounted for\nthe overlap, and its disclosed total Scope 3 emissions.540 For example, a mining registrant may\nmine and process iron ore for conversion into steel products. Because the processing of iron ore\nand steelmaking both require the use of coal, GHG emissions would arise both from the\ndownstream activities involving the processing of sold products and the use of sold products\n(i.e., the use of iron ore in the production of steel). If the registrant has allocated GHG emissions\nto both categories (i.e., processing of sold products and use of sold products), it would be\nrequired to describe the overlap in emissions between the two categories of downstream\nactivities, how it accounted for the overlap, and the effect on its disclosed total Scope 3\nemissions. For example, if the total reported Scope 3 emissions involved some double-counting\nbecause of the overlap, a registrant would be required to report this effect. This information\ncould help investors better understand the true extent of a registrant\u2019s disclosed Scope 3\nemissions and, thus, the climate-related risks faced by the registrant.\nFinally, a proposed provision would provide that a registrant may present its estimated\nScope 3 emissions in terms of a range as long as it discloses its reasons for using the range and\nthe underlying assumptions.541 This proposed provision reflects our understanding that, because\n540 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(e)(9).\n541 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(e)(4)(ii).\n201\n\na registrant may encounter more difficulties obtaining all of the data required for determining its\nScope 3 emissions compared to determining its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions, presenting its Scope 3\nemissions in terms of a range may be a reasonable means of estimating these emissions when\nfaced with such gaps in the data.\nRequest for Comment\n115. Should we require a registrant to disclose the methodology, significant inputs, and\nsignificant assumptions used to calculate its GHG emissions metrics, as proposed? Should we\nrequire a registrant to use a particular methodology for determining its GHG emission metrics?\nIf so, should the required methodology be pursuant to the GHG Protocol\u2019s Corporate Accounting\nand Reporting Standard and related standards and guidance? Is there another methodology that\nwe should require a registrant to follow when determining its GHG emissions? Should we base\nour climate disclosure rules on certain concepts developed by the GHG Protocol without\nrequiring a registrant to follow the GHG Protocol in all respects, as proposed? Would this\nprovide flexibility for registrants to choose certain methods and approaches in connection with\nGHG emissions determination that meet the particular circumstances of their industry or business\nor that emerge along with developments in GHG emissions methodology as long as they are\ntransparent about the methods and underlying assumptions used? Are there adjustments that\nshould be made to the proposed methodology disclosure requirements that would provide\nflexibility for registrants while providing sufficient comparability for investors?\n116. Should we require a registrant to disclose the organizational boundaries used to\ncalculate its GHG emissions, as proposed? Should we require a registrant to determine its\norganizational boundaries using the same scope of entities, operations, assets, and other holdings\nwithin its business organization as that used in its consolidated financial statements, as proposed?\n202\n\nWould prescribing this method of determining organizational boundaries avoid potential investor\nconfusion about the reporting scope used in determining a registrant\u2019s GHG emissions and the\nreporting scope used for the financial statement metrics, which are included in the financial\nstatements? Would prescribing this method of determining organizational boundaries result in\nmore robust guidance for registrants and enhanced comparability for investors? If, as proposed,\nthe organizational boundaries must be consistent with the scope of the registrant\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial statements, would requiring separate disclosure of the organizational boundaries be\nredundant or otherwise unnecessary?\n117. Except for calculating Scope 3 emissions, the proposed rules would not require a\nregistrant to disclose the emissions from investments that are not consolidated, proportionately\nconsolidated, or that do not qualify for the equity method of accounting. Should we require such\ndisclosures for Scopes 1 and 2 emissions, and if so, how?\n118. Could situations arise where it is impracticable for a registrant to align the scope of its\norganizational boundaries for GHG emission data with the scope of the consolidation for the rest\nof its financial statements? If so, should we allow a registrant to take a different approach to\ndetermining the organizational boundaries of its GHG emissions and provide related disclosure,\nincluding an estimation of the resulting difference in emissions disclosure (in addition to\ndisclosure about methodology and other matters that would be required by the proposed GHG\nemissions disclosure rules)?\n119. Alternatively, should we require registrants to use the organizational boundary\napproaches recommended by the GHG Protocol (e.g., financial control, operational control, or\nequity share)? Do those approaches provide a clear enough framework for complying with the\nproposed rules? Would such an approach cause confusion when analyzing information in the\n203\n\ncontext of the consolidated financial statements or diminish comparability? If we permit a\nregistrant to choose one of the three organizational boundary approaches recommended by the\nGHG Protocol, should we require a reconciliation with the scope of the rest of the registrant\u2019s\nfinancial reporting to make the disclosure more comparable?\n120. Should we require a registrant to disclose its operational boundaries, as proposed?\nShould we require a registrant to discuss its approach towards the categorization of emissions\n(e.g., as direct or indirect emissions) and emissions sources (e.g., stationary or mobile) when\ndescribing its operational boundaries, as proposed?\n121. The proposed operational boundaries disclosure is based largely on concepts developed\nby the GHG Protocol. Would requiring a registrant to determine its organizational boundaries\npursuant to the GAAP applicable to the financial statement metrics included in the financial\nstatements but its operational boundaries largely pursuant to concepts developed by the GHG\nProtocol cause confusion? Should we require a registrant to apply the GAAP applicable to its\nfinancial statements when determining whether it \u201ccontrols\u201d a particular source pursuant to the\ndefinition of Scope 1 emissions, or particular operations pursuant to the definition of Scope 2\nemissions, as proposed? If not, how should \u201ccontrol\u201d be determined and would applying a\ndefinition of control that differs from applicable GAAP result in confusion for investors?\n122. Should we require a registrant to use the same organizational boundaries when\ncalculating its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions, as proposed? Are there any circumstances when a\nregistrant\u2019s organizational boundaries for determining its Scope 2 emissions should differ from\nthose required for determining its Scope 1 emissions? Should we also require a registrant to\napply the same organizational boundaries used when determining its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions as\nan initial step in identifying the sources of indirect emissions from activities in its value chain\n204\n\nover which it lacks ownership and control and which must be included in the calculation of its\nScope 3 emissions, as proposed? Are there any circumstances where using a different\norganizational boundary for purposes of Scope 3 emissions disclosure would be appropriate?\n123. Should we require a registrant to be consistent in its use of its organizational and\noperational boundaries once it has set those boundaries, as proposed? Would the proposed\nrequirement help investors to track and compare the registrant\u2019s GHG emissions over time?\n124. Should we require a registrant to disclose the methodology for calculating the GHG\nemissions, including any emission factors used and the source of the emission factors, as\nproposed? Should we require a registrant to use a particular set of emission factors, such as\nthose provided by the EPA or the GHG Protocol?\n125. Should we permit a registrant to use reasonable estimates when disclosing its GHG\nemissions as long as it also describes the assumptions underlying, and its reasons for using, the\nestimates, as proposed? Should we permit the use of estimates for only certain GHG emissions,\nsuch as Scope 3 emissions? Should we permit a registrant to use a reasonable estimate of its\nGHG emissions for its fourth fiscal quarter if no actual reported data is reasonably available,\ntogether with actual, determined GHG emissions data for its first three fiscal quarters when\ndisclosing its GHG emissions for its most recently completed fiscal year, as long as the registrant\npromptly discloses in a subsequent filing any material difference between the estimate used and\nthe actual, determined GHG emissions data for the fourth fiscal quarter, as proposed? If so,\nshould we require a registrant to report any such material difference in its next Form 10-Q if\ndomestic, or in a Form 6-K, if a foreign private issuer? Should we permit a domestic registrant\nto report any such material difference in a Form 8-K if such form is filed (rather than furnished)\n205\n\nwith the Commission? Should any such reasonable estimate be subject to conditions to help\nensure accuracy and comparability? If so, what conditions should apply?\n126. Should we require a registrant to disclose, to the extent material, any use of third-party\ndata when calculating its GHG emissions, regardless of the particular scope of emissions, as\nproposed? Should we require the disclosure of the use of third-party data only for certain GHG\nemissions, such as Scope 3 emissions? Should we require the disclosure of the use of third-\nparty data for Scope 3 emissions, regardless of its materiality to the determination of those\nemissions? If a registrant discloses the use of third-party data, should it also be required to\nidentify the source of such data and the process the registrant undertook to obtain and assess the\ndata, as proposed?\n127. Should we require a registrant to disclose any material change to the methodology or\nassumptions underlying its GHG emissions disclosure from the previous year, as proposed? If\nso, should we require a registrant to restate its GHG emissions data for the previous year, or for\nthe number of years for which GHG emissions data has been provided in the filing, using the\nchanged methodology or assumptions? If a registrant\u2019s organizational or operational boundaries,\nin addition to methodology or assumptions, change, to what extent should we require such\ndisclosures of the material change, restatements or reconciliations? In these cases, should we\nrequire a registrant to apply certain accounting standards or principles, such as FASB ASC Topic\n250, as guidance regarding when retrospective disclosure should be required?\n128. Should we require a registrant to disclose, to the extent material, any gaps in the data\nrequired to calculate its GHG emissions, as proposed? Should we require the disclosure of data\ngaps only for certain GHG emissions, such as Scope 3 emissions? If a registrant discloses any\ndata gaps encountered when calculating its Scope 3 emissions or other type of GHG emissions,\n206\n\nshould it be required to discuss whether it used proxy data or another method to address such\ngaps, and how its management of any data gaps has affected the accuracy or completeness of its\nGHG emissions disclosure, as proposed? Are there other disclosure requirements or conditions\nwe should adopt to help investors obtain a reasonably complete understanding of a registrant\u2019s\nexposure to the GHG emissions sourced by each scope of emissions?\n129. When determining the materiality of its Scope 3 emissions, or when disclosing those\nemissions, should a registrant be required to include GHG emissions from outsourced activities\nthat it previously conducted as part of its own operations, as reflected in the financial statements\nfor the periods covered in the filing, in addition to emissions from activities in its value chain, as\nproposed? Would this requirement help ensure that investors receive a complete picture of a\nregistrant\u2019s carbon footprint by precluding the registrant from excluding emissions from\nactivities that are typically conducted as part of operations over which it has ownership or\ncontrol but that are outsourced in order to reduce its Scopes 1 or 2 emissions? Should a\nrequirement to include outsourced activities be subject to certain conditions or exceptions and, if\nso, what conditions or exceptions?\n130. Should we require a registrant that must disclose its Scope 3 emissions to discuss\nwhether there was any significant overlap in the categories of activities that produced the Scope\n3 emissions? If so, should a registrant be required to describe any overlap, how it accounted for\nthe overlap, and its effect on the total Scope 3 emissions, as proposed? Would this requirement\nhelp investors assess the accuracy and reliability of the Scope 3 emissions disclosure?\n131. Should we permit a registrant to present its Scope 3 emissions in terms of a range as\nlong as it discloses its reasons for using the range and the underlying assumptions, as proposed?\nShould we place limits or other parameters regarding the use of a range and, if so, what should\n207"

What other conditions or guidance should we provide to help ensure that a range, if\nused, is not overly broad and is otherwise reasonable?\n132. Should we require a registrant to follow a certain set of published standards for\ncalculating Scope 3 emissions that have been developed for a registrant\u2019s industry or that are\notherwise broadly accepted? For example, should we require a registrant in the financial\nindustry to follow PCAF\u2019s Global GHG Accounting & Reporting Standard for the Financial\nIndustry when calculating its financed emissions within the \u201cInvestments\u201d category of Scope 3\nemissions?

If we should require the use of a third-party standard\nfor Scope 3 emissions reporting, or any other scope of emissions, how should we implement this\nrequirement?\n3. The Scope 3 Emissions Disclosure Safe Harbor and Other Accommodations\nWe recognize that the calculation and disclosure of Scope 3 emissions may pose\ndifficulties compared to Scopes 1 and 2 emissions, which has caused concern for some\ncommenters.542 It may be difficult to obtain activity data from suppliers and other third parties in\na registrant\u2019s value chain, or to verify the accuracy of that information. It may also be necessary\nto rely heavily on estimates and assumptions to generate Scope 3 emissions data. For example,\n542 See, e.g., letter from Dimensional Fund Advisors; see also supra note 422.\n208\n\nregistrants may need to rely on assumptions about how customers will use their products in order\nto calculate Scope 3 emissions from the use of sold products.\nDepending on the size and complexity of a company and its value chain, the task of\ncalculating Scope 3 emissions could be challenging.543 We expect that some of these challenges\nmay recede over time. For example, as more companies make their Scope 1 and 2 emissions\ndata publicly available, these data can serve as the input for other companies\u2019 Scope 3\ncalculations. In addition, large companies that are voluntarily disclosing Scope 3 emissions\ninformation currently are also working with suppliers to increase access to emissions data and\nimprove its reliability,544 which could have positive spillover effects for other companies that use\nthe same suppliers. Furthermore, within certain industries, there is work underway to improve\nmethodologies and share best practices to make Scope 3 calculations less burdensome and more\nreliable.545 Notwithstanding these anticipated developments, calculating and disclosing Scope 3\n543 While there may be less challenging approaches, such as using industry averages or proxies for activity data\n(such as economic data), the result may be less accurate and could obscure the impact of choices that companies\nmay make to reduce their Scope 3 emissions. For example, if a company uses industry averages to calculate\nScope 3 emissions from shipping its products, it may have difficulty communicating to investors how its\nselection of a shipping company that runs on lower emissions fuel or picks more efficient routes has lowered its\nScope 3 emissions.\n544 See, e.g., Apple, Environmental Social Governance Report (2021), available at\nhttps://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_downloads/2021/08/2021_Apple_ESG_Report.pdf (stating that\nApple works with its suppliers to help address Apple\u2019s environmental commitments, such as becoming carbon\nneutral by 2030 across its entire product footprint).\n545 See, e.g., PCAF, The Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry. In addition,\nthe American Petroleum Institute has developed an overview of Scope 3 methodologies to inform oil and gas\ncompanies about Scope 3 estimation approaches. See API and IPIECA, Estimating petroleum industry value\nchain (Scope 3) greenhouse gas emissions, available at https://www.api.org/~/media/Files/EHS/climate-\nchange/Scope-3-emissions-reporting-guidance-2016.pdf. Finally, an initiative launched by food and beverage\ncompanies, Danone and Mars, together with the Science Based Targets Initiative, aims to provide Scope 3\nguidance to companies in difference industries, starting with the food and beverage industry. See SB, Serious\nAbout Scope 3: Pioneering Companies Embracing Complexity, Reaping the Benefits, available at\nhttps://sustainablebrands.com/read/supply-chain/serious-about-scope-3-pioneering-companies-embracing-\ncomplexity-reaping-the-benefits.\n209\n\nemissions could represent a challenge for certain registrants, in particular those that do not\ncurrently report such information on a voluntary basis.\nTo balance concerns about reporting Scope 3 emissions with the need for decision-useful\nemissions disclosure, we are proposing the following accommodations for Scope 3 emissions\ndisclosure:\n\u2022 A safe harbor for Scope 3 emissions disclosure from certain forms of liability under the\nFederal securities laws;546\n\u2022 An exemption for smaller reporting companies (\u201cSRCs\u201d) from the Scope 3 emissions\ndisclosure provision;547 and\n\u2022 A delayed compliance date for Scope 3 emissions disclosure.548\nWe are proposing a safe harbor for Scope 3 emissions disclosure to alleviate concerns\nthat registrants may have about liability for information that would be derived largely from third\nparties in a registrant\u2019s value chain. Many commenters recommended that the Commission\nadopt a safe harbor for climate-related disclosures.549 These commenters asserted that a safe\nharbor would encourage registrants to provide meaningful, quantitative metrics and analysis.\nOther commenters focused their recommendation for a safe harbor on certain types of climate-\n546 See 17 CFR 229.1504(f).\n547 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(c)(3).\n548 See infra Section II.M.\n549 See, e.g., letters from ACCO Brands Corp.; American Bankers Association; American Petroleum Institute;\nAmerican Property Casualty Insurance Association; Associated General Contractors of America; Bank of\nAmerica Corporation; Biotechnology Innovation Organization; ConocoPhillips; Delta Airlines, Inc.

The proposed safe harbor would provide that\ndisclosure of Scope 3 emissions by or on behalf of the registrant would be deemed not to be a\nfraudulent statement unless it is shown that such statement was made or reaffirmed without a\nreasonable basis or was disclosed other than in good faith.553 The safe harbor would extend to\nany statement regarding Scope 3 emissions that is disclosed pursuant to proposed subpart 1500\nof Regulation S-K and made in a document filed with the Commission.554 For purposes of the\nproposed safe harbor, the term \u201cfraudulent statement\u201d would be defined to mean a statement that\nis an untrue statement of material fact, a statement false or misleading with respect to any\nmaterial fact, an omission to state a material fact necessary to make a statement not misleading,\n550 See, e.g., letters from Business Council for Sustainable Energy; Dimensional Fund Advisors; and Independent\nCommunity Bankers of America.\n551 See, e.g., letters from AICPA; BlackRock; Center for Climate and Energy Solutions; Crowe LLP; Energy\nStrategy Coalition; Institute of Management Accountants; Japanese Bankers Association; Nareit; National\nMining Association; and Newmont Corporation.\n552 See, e.g., letters from Dimensional Fund Advisors; and International Capital Markets Association (June 15,\n2021).\n553 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(f)(1).\n554 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(f)(2).\n211\n\nor that constitutes the employment of a manipulative, deceptive, or fraudulent device,\ncontrivance, scheme, transaction, act, practice, course of business, or an artifice to defraud as\nthose terms are used in the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or the rules or regulations\npromulgated thereunder.555 The proposed safe harbor is intended to mitigate potential liability\nconcerns associated with providing emissions disclosure based on third-party information by\nmaking clear that registrants would only be liable for such disclosure if it was made without a\nreasonable basis or was disclosed other than in good faith. It also may encourage more robust\nScope 3 emissions information, to the extent registrants feel reassured about relying on actual\nthird-party data as opposed to national or industry averages for their emissions estimates.\nSeveral commenters expressed concern that the Commission would impose a \u201cone size\nfits all\u201d approach, which could disproportionately impact smaller registrants, when adopting\nclimate-related disclosure rules.556 Several commenters recommended that the Commission\nphase-in or scale down the climate-related disclosure requirements for smaller registrants.557\nAlthough we are not proposing to exempt SRCs from the full scope of the proposed\nclimate-related disclosure rules, we are proposing to exempt SRCs from the proposed Scope 3\nemissions disclosure requirement.558 We believe that exempting SRCs from the proposed Scope\n555 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(f)(3). This definition is based on the definition of fraudulent statement in 17\nCFR 230.175.\n556 See, e.g., letters from Elisha Doerr (May 24, 2021); Freedomworks Foundation (June 14, 2021); Roger Hawkins\n(May 24, 2021); and Jonathan Skee (May 26, 2021).\n557 See, e.g., letters from American Bankers Association (June 11, 2021); Biotechnology Innovation Organization\n(June 15, 2021); BNP Paribas; Cardano Risk Management Ltd.; Catavento Consultancy; Chamber of\nCommerce (June 11, 2021); Credit Roundtable (June 11, 2021); Douglas Hileman Consulting; Environmental\nBankers Association (June 9, 2021); Grant Thornton; Virginia Harper Ho; Manulife Investment Management;\nMirova US; Morrison & Foerster; NEI Investments (June 11, 2021); New York State Society of Certified Public\nAccountants; PIMCO; and SIFMA.\n558 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(c)(3). We also are proposing a later compliance date for SRCs. See infra\nSection II.M.\n212\n\n3 emissions disclosure requirement would be appropriate in light of the proportionately higher\ncosts they could incur, compared to non-SRCs, to engage in the data gathering, verification, and\nother actions associated with Scope 3 emissions reporting, many of which may have fixed cost\ncomponents.\nTo further ease the burden of complying with the proposed Scope 3 disclosure\nrequirement, we are also proposing a delayed compliance date for this requirement. As\nexplained in greater detail below, all registrants, regardless of their size, would have an\nadditional year to comply initially with the Scope 3 disclosure requirement beyond the\ncompliance date for the other proposed rules. Moreover, because a registrant\u2019s Scope 3\nemissions consist of the Scopes 1 and 2 emissions of its suppliers, distributors, and other third\nparties in the registrant\u2019s value chain, to the extent those parties become subject to the proposed\nrules, the increased availability of Scopes 1 and 2 emissions data following the rules\u2019\neffectiveness should help ease the burden of complying with the Scope 3 emissions disclosure\nrequirement.\nFinally, we note that Securities Act Rule 409 and Exchange Act Rule 12b-21, which\nprovide accommodations for information that is unknown and not reasonably available, would be\navailable for the proposed Scope 3 emissions disclosures.559 These rules allow for the\nconditional omission of required information when such information is unknown and not\nreasonably available to the registrant, either because obtaining the information would involve\n559 See 17 CFR 230.409 and 17 CFR 240.12b-21.\n213\n\nunreasonable effort or expense, or because the information rests peculiarly within the knowledge\nof another person not affiliated with the registrant.560\nRequest for Comment\n133. Should we provide a safe harbor for Scope 3 emissions disclosure, as proposed? Is the\nscope of the proposed safe harbor clear and appropriate? For example, should the safe harbor\napply to any registrant that provides Scope 3 disclosure pursuant to the proposed rules, as\nproposed? Should we limit the use of the safe harbor to certain classes of registrants or to\nregistrants meeting certain conditions and, if so, which classes or conditions? For example,\nshould we require the use of a particular methodology for calculating and reporting Scope 3\nemissions, such as the PCAF Standard if the registrant is a financial institution, or the GHG\nProtocol Scope 3 Accounting and Reporting Standard for other types of registrants? Should we\nclarify the scope of persons covered by the language \u201cby or on behalf of a registrant\u201d by\nincluding language about outside reviewers retained by the registrant or others? Should we\ndefine a \u201cfraudulent statement,\u201d as proposed? Is the level of diligence required for the proposed\nsafe harbor (i.e., that the statement was made or reaffirmed with a reasonable basis and disclosed\nin good faith) the appropriate standard? Should the safe harbor apply to other climate-related\ndisclosures, such as Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosures, any targets and goals disclosures in\nresponse to proposed Item 1505 (discussed below), or the financial statement metrics disclosures\nrequired pursuant to Proposed Article 14 of Regulation S-X? Should the safe harbor apply\nindefinitely, or should we include a sunset provision that would eliminate the safe harbor some\nnumber of years, (e.g., five years) after the effective date or applicable compliance date of the\n560 See id. We expect, however, that a registrant that requires emissions data from another registrant in its value\nchain would be able to obtain that data without unreasonable effort or expense because of the increased\navailability of Scopes 1 and 2 emissions data for registrants following the effectiveness of the proposed rules.\n214"

Should we provide an exemption from Scope 3 emissions disclosure for SRCs, as\nproposed? Should the exemption not apply to a SRC that has set a target or goal or otherwise\nmade a commitment to reduce its Scope 3 emissions? Are there other classes of registrants we\nshould exempt from the Scope 3 emissions disclosure requirement? For example, should we\nexempt EGCs, foreign private issuers, or a registrant that is filing or has filed a registration\nstatement for its initial public offering during its most recently completed fiscal year from the\nScope 3 disclosure requirement? Instead of an exemption, should we provide a longer phase in\nfor the Scope 3 disclosure requirements for SRCs than for other registrants?\nH. Attestation of Scope 1 and Scope 2 Emissions Disclosure\n1. Overview\nThe proposed rules would require a registrant, including a foreign private issuer, that is\nan accelerated filer or large accelerated filer to include in the relevant filing an attestation report\ncovering the disclosure of its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions561 and to provide certain related\ndisclosures about the service provider.562 As proposed, the attestation engagement must, at a\n561 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(a). In order to attest to the Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosure, we believe a\nGHG emissions attestation provider would need to include in its evaluation relevant contextual information. In\nparticular, the attestation provider would be required to evaluate the registrant\u2019s compliance with (i) proposed\nItem 1504(a), which includes presentation requirements (e.g., disaggregation by each constituent greenhouse\ngas), (ii) the calculation instructions included in proposed Item 1504(b), and (iii) the disclosure requirements in\nproposed Item 1504(e) regarding methodology, organizational boundary, and operational boundary. See infra\nSection II.H.3 for further discussion of the criteria against which the Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosure are\nmeasured or evaluated.\n562 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(d).\n215\n\nminimum, be at the following assurance level for the indicated fiscal year for the required GHG\nemissions disclosure:563\nLimited Assurance Reasonable Assurance\nFiscal Years 2 and 3 after Scopes 1 and 2 Fiscal Years 4 and beyond after Scopes 1 and 2\nemissions disclosure compliance date emissions disclosure compliance date\nTo provide additional clarity, the following table illustrates the application of the\ntransition periods assuming that the proposed rules will be adopted with an effective date in\nDecember 2022 and that the accelerated filer or large accelerated filer has a December 31st fiscal\nyear-end:\nFiler Type Scopes 1 and 2 GHG Limited Reasonable\nDisclosure Compliance Date* Assurance Assurance\nAccelerated Fiscal year 2024 (filed in 2025) Fiscal year 2025 Fiscal year 2027\nFiler (filed in 2026) (filed in 2028)\nLarge Fiscal year 2023 (filed in 2024) Fiscal year 2024 Fiscal year 2026\nAccelerated (filed in 2025) (filed in 2027)\nFiler\n* See infra Section II.M for a discussion of the proposed disclosure compliance dates for Scopes 1 and 2 GHG\nemissions disclosure. If the accelerated filer or the large accelerated filer has a non-calendar-year fiscal year-end\ndate that results in its 2024 or 2023 fiscal year, respectively, commencing before the compliance dates of the\nrules, it would not be required to comply with proposed GHG emissions disclosure requirements until the\nfollowing fiscal year (as discussed below in Section II.M). Accordingly, for such filers, the time period for\ncompliance with the corresponding attestation requirements under proposed Item 1505 would be one year later\nthan illustrated above.\nDuring the transition period when limited assurance is required, the proposed rules would\npermit an accelerated filer or a large accelerated filer, at its option, to obtain reasonable\nassurance of its Scope 1 and 2 emissions disclosure.564 For example, an accelerated filer or a\n563 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(a)(1).\n564 Reasonable assurance is equivalent to the level of assurance provided in an audit of a registrant\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial statements included in a Form 10-K. Limited assurance is equivalent to the level of assurance\n(commonly referred to as a \u201creview\u201d) provided over a registrant\u2019s interim financial statements included in a\nForm 10-Q.\n216\n\nlarge accelerated filer may choose to obtain reasonable assurance such that its GHG emissions\ndisclosure receives the same level of assurance as its financial statements.565\nAt its option, an accelerated filer or a large accelerated filer would be able to obtain any\nlevel of assurance over its climate-related disclosures that are not required to be assured pursuant\nto proposed Item 1505(a). For example, an accelerated filer or a large accelerated filer could\nvoluntarily include an attestation report at the limited assurance level for its GHG intensity\nmetrics or its Scope 3 emissions disclosure. To avoid potential confusion, however, the\nvoluntary assurance obtained by such filer would be required to follow the requirements of\nproposed Item 1505(b)\u2013(d), including using the same attestation standard as the required\nassurance over Scope 1 and Scope 2.566 For filings made by accelerated filers and large\naccelerated filers after the compliance date for the GHG emissions disclosure requirements but\nbefore proposed Item 1505(a) requires limited assurance, the filer would only be required to\nprovide the disclosure called for by proposed Item 1505(e). As discussed below in Section\nII.H.5, a registrant that is not an accelerated filer or a large accelerated filer that obtains\nvoluntary assurance would be required to comply only with proposed Item 1505(e).\n565 We refer to \u201cassurance\u201d broadly when describing the level and scope of assurance to which climate-related\ndisclosures should be subject. Our proposed approach to assurance has been guided by \u201cattestation\u201d standards\npublished by organizations including the PCAOB, AICPA, and the International Auditing and Assurance\nStandards Board (\u201cIAASB\u201d). Such attestation standards apply to engagements other than audit and review of\nhistorical financial statements and have been widely used in the current voluntary ESG and GHG assurance\nmarket for a number of years.\n566 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(a)(2). If the accelerated filer or large accelerated filer was required to obtain\nreasonable assurance over its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions disclosures and the attestation provider chose to\nfollow, for example, the AICPA attestation standards, the accelerated filer or large accelerated filer could\nvoluntarily obtain limited assurance over its GHG intensity metric or Scope 3 emissions disclosures, and the\nattestation provider would be required to follow the AICPA\u2019s attestation standard for providing limited\nassurance.\n217\n\nMany commenters recommended that we require climate-related disclosures to be subject\nto some level of assurance to enhance the reliability of the disclosures.567 Commenters noted\nthat companies are increasingly seeking some type of third-party assurance or verification over\nESG and climate-related disclosures. For example, according to one commenter, 80 percent of\nS&P 100 companies currently subject certain items of their ESG information, including climate-\nrelated disclosures such as greenhouse gas emissions, to some type of third-party assurance or\nverification.568 Several commenters recommended that we require climate-related disclosures to\nbe subject to limited assurance,569 which provides a lower level of assurance than reasonable\nassurance, but is less costly, and is the most common form of assurance provided for ESG,\nincluding climate-related disclosures, in the current voluntary reporting landscape.570\nOne commenter recommended that, at a minimum, we require a registrant to obtain a\nlimited assurance report for its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosure while encouraging optional\nverification for other ESG metrics.571 Another commenter indicated that a limited assurance\nrequirement for climate-related disclosures would be similar to the EU\u2019s Corporate Sustainability\n567 See, e.g., letters from AICPA; Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund et al; Andrew Behar; Baillie\nGifford; Carbon Tracker Initiative; Cardano Risk Management Ltd.; CDP; Center for American Progress;\nCenter for Audit Quality; Ceres et al.; Climate Disclosure Standards Board; Climate Governance Initiative;\nEmmanuelle Haack; Eni SpA; ERM CVS (recommending limited assurance); George Serafeim; Regenerative\nCrisis Response Committee; Friends of the Earth, Amazon Watch, and Rainforest Action Network; Hermes\nEquity Ownership Limited; Impax Asset Management; Institutional Shareholder Services; Interfaith Center on\nCorporate Responsibility (recommending reasonable assurance); International Corporate Governance Institute;\nInternational Organization for Standardization; Morningstar, Inc.; Natural Resources Defense Council; NY City\nComptroller; NY State Comptroller; Oxfam America; PRI ; Pricewaterhouse Coopers; Revolving Door Project;\nTotalEnergies (recommending limited assurance); Value Balancing Alliance; WBCSD; William and Flora\nHewlett Foundation; and World Benchmarking Alliance.\n568 See letter from CAQ; see also CAQ, S&P 500 and ESG Reporting (Aug. 9, 2021), available at\nhttps://www.thecaq.org/sp-500-and-esg-reporting/ (stating that more than half of S&P 500 companies had some\nform of assurance or verification over ESG metrics, including GHG emissions metrics).\n569 See, e.g., letters from Credit Suisse; ERM CVS; PayPal Holdings, Inc.; TotalEnergies; and Walmart.\n570 See letter from Energy Infrastructure Council; see also CAQ, S&P 500 and ESG Reporting (Aug. 9, 2021).\n571 See letter from PayPal Holdings, Inc.\n218\n\nReporting Directive proposal that, if adopted, would initially require companies in the European\nUnion to obtain limited assurance on reported sustainability information with an option to move\ntowards reasonable assurance in the future.572 One commenter stated the view that, while the\nprofessional capacity of audit firms might, at this point, be insufficient to provide reasonable\nassurance of ESG data, it supported a mandatory limited assurance requirement for climate risk\nreporting.573 Other commenters recommended that we require climate-related disclosures to be\naudited at the reasonable assurance level.574\nSome commenters, however, opposed any third-party assurance requirement for climate-\nrelated disclosures because of the significant cost that these commenters asserted it could impose\non public companies, and because, in their view, application of assurance standards to data that is\ndifferent from traditional financial reporting disclosures, such as GHG emissions, would be a\nrelatively new and evolving field.575 Some of these commenters indicated that, as a first step,\nregistrants should develop their internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures (\u201cDCP\u201d)\nto include climate-related disclosures, and defer mandated third-party assurance requirements to\na later time.576\nWe recognize that requiring GHG emissions disclosure in Commission filings should\nenhance the consistency, comparability, and reliability of such disclosures due to the application\n572 See letter from CAQ.\n573 See letter from Credit Suisse.\n574 See, e.g., letters from Ceres et al.; and Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility.\n575 See, e.g., letters from American Petroleum Institute; Investment Company Institute; and National Association of\nManufacturers.\n576 See, e.g., letters from American Petroleum Institute; and Investment Company Institute. We agree that\nregistrants should develop their DCP to include their GHG emissions disclosures. When the proposed GHG\nemissions disclosures are included in Form 10-K and Form 20-F annual reports, our rules governing DCP\nwould apply to those disclosures. See 17 CFR 240.13a-15 and 240.15d-15.\n219\n\nof DCP and the proposed inclusion of certain prescriptive elements that may help improve\nstandardization of GHG emissions calculations. Nevertheless, the evolving and unique nature of\nGHG emissions reporting involves and, in some cases, warrants varying methodologies, differing\nassumptions, and a substantial amount of estimation. Certain aspects of GHG emissions\ndisclosure also involve reliance on third-party data. As such, requiring a third party\u2019s attestation\nover these disclosures would provide investors with an additional degree of reliability regarding\nnot only the figures that are disclosed, but also the key assumptions, methodologies, and data\nsources the registrant used to arrive at those figures. In other contexts, such as mineral resources\nand oil and gas reserves, the Commission has recognized the value that third parties with\nspecialized expertise in audit and engineering can bring to company disclosures of physical\nresources or risks.577\nOur rules typically do not require registrants to obtain assurance over disclosure provided\noutside of the financial statements, including quantitative disclosure. We believe, however, that\nthere are important distinctions between existing quantitative disclosure required to be provided\noutside of the financial statements and the proposed GHG emissions disclosure. In contrast to\nGHG emissions disclosure, quantitative disclosure outside of the financial statements typically is\nderived, at least in part, from the same books and records that are used to generate a registrant\u2019s\naudited financial statements and accompanying notesand that are subject to ICFR. Accordingly,\nsuch quantitative disclosure has been subject to audit procedures as part of the audit of the\n577 See 17 CFR 229.1302 (requiring a registrant\u2019s disclosure of exploration results, mineral resources, or mineral\nreserves to be based on and accurately reflect information and supporting documentation prepared by a\nqualified person, which, pursuant to 17 CFR 229.1300, is defined to mean a mineral industry professional with\nat least five years of relevant experience in the type of mineralization and type of deposit under consideration\nwho meets certain additional criteria); and 17 CFR 229.1202(a)(7) (requiring a registrant to disclose the\nqualifications of the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the oil and gas\nreserves estimates or reserves audit).\n220\n\nfinancial statements in the same filing. Further, the auditor\u2019s read and consider obligation\nrequires an evaluation of this quantitative information based on the information obtained through\nthe audit of the financial statements.578 Unlike other quantitative information that is provided\noutside of the financial statements, GHG emissions disclosure would generally not be developed\nfrom information that is included in the registrant\u2019s books and records and, therefore, would not\nbe subjected to audit procedures.579 In addition, although not an assurance engagement, we have\nadopted rules requiring an expert to review and provide conclusions on other specialized,\nquantitative data that is provided outside of the financial statements.580 Accordingly, to enhance\nits reliability, we believe it is appropriate to require that GHG emissions disclosure be subject to\nthird-party attestation.\nFor similar reasons, we also considered proposing to require that management assess and\ndisclose the effectiveness of controls over GHG emissions disclosure (apart from the existing\nrequirements with respect to the assessment and effectiveness of DCP). More specifically, in\naddition to the requirement to assess such controls, we considered whether to require\nmanagement to include a statement in their annual report regarding their responsibility for the\n578 See PCAOB AS 2710 Other Information in Documents Containing Audited Financial Statements (requiring an\nauditor to read the other information (included in an annual report with the audited financial statements) and\nconsider whether such information, or the manner of its presentation, is materially inconsistent with\ninformation, or the manner of its presentation, appearing in the financial statements). For example, disclosure\npursuant to 17 CFR 229.303 (Item 303 of Regulation S-K \u2013 MD&A) is derived in part from the same books and\nrecords that are subject to ICFR and used to generate a registrant\u2019s audited financial statements and\naccompanying notes (e.g., the liquidity and capital resources disclosures are anchored to the audited cash flows\ninformation disclosed in the financial statements).\n579 Although GHG emission disclosure would generally not be directly derived from the same books and records\nthat are used to generate a registrant\u2019s audited financial statements and accompanying notes and that are subject\nto ICFR , GHG emission disclosure, as proposed, would be required to use the same organizational and\noperational boundaries as the registrant\u2019s financial statement disclosures. See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(e)(2).\n580 See Modernization of Property Disclosures for Mining Registrants, Release No. 33-10570 (Oct. 31, 2018), [83\nFR 66344 (Dec. 26, 2018)].\n221\n\ndesign and evaluation of controls over GHG emissions disclosures, as well as to disclose their\nconclusion regarding the effectiveness of such controls. We also considered proposing to require\na GHG emissions attestation provider\u2019s attestation of the effectiveness of controls over GHG\nemissions disclosure in addition to the proposed attestation over the Scopes 1 and 2 GHG\nemissions disclosure. Although both such requirements could further enhance the reliability of\nthe related Scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions disclosure, we are not currently proposing them at\nthis time. We are, however, continuing to consider these alternatives, including: (i) the need to\ndevelop guidance for management on conducting such an assessment and (ii) whether\nappropriate attestation standards exist. Accordingly, we request comment on these and related\nissues below.\nThe Commission has long recognized the important role played by an independent audit\nin contributing to the reliability of financial reporting.581 Relatedly, studies suggest that\ninvestors have greater confidence in information that has been assured, particularly when it is\nassured at the reasonable assurance level.582 Although a limited assurance engagement provides\na lower level of assurance than a reasonable assurance engagement,583 studies of ESG-related\nassurance, which is typically provided at a limited assurance level, have found benefits such as\n581 See Qualifications of Accountants, Release No. 33-10876 (Oct. 16, 2020) [85 FR 80508 (Dec. 11, 2020)], at\n80508.

This fragmentation has diminished the comparability of the assurance provided and\nmay require investors to become familiar with many different assurance standards and the\nvarying benefits of different levels of assurance. The consequences of such fragmentation has\nalso been highlighted by certain international organizations,588 including IOSCO, which stated\nthat the \u201cperceived lack of clarity and consistency around the purpose and scope of [voluntary]\nassurance . . . potentially lead[s] to market confusion, including misleading investors and\nexacerbating the expectations gap.\u201d589 For example, investors may see that a service provider\nhas produced an assurance report for a registrant\u2019s GHG emissions disclosure and have an\nexpectation that such assurance will enhance the reliability of that disclosure without always\nunderstanding the service provider\u2019s qualifications for producing the report, what level of\nassurance (e.g., limited versus reasonable) is being provided, what scope of assurance (e.g., the\ndisclosures covered by the assurance) is being provided with respect to the registrant\u2019s GHG\n588 International Federation of Accountants, The State of Play in Sustainability Assurance (June 23, 2021),\navailable at https://www.ifac.org/knowledge-gateway/contributing-global-economy/discussion/state-play-\nsustainability-assurance; Lawrence Heim, International Federation of Accountants, IFAC: Poor ESG Assurance\nan \u201cEmerging Financial Stability Risk\u201d (July 1, 2021), available at https://practicalesg.com/2021/07/ifac-poor-\nesg-assurance-an-emerging-financial-stability-risk/.\n589 IOSCO, Report on Sustainability-related Issuer Disclosures (June 2021).\n224\n\nemissions disclosure, and the methodologies and procedures that the attestation provider used.\nWhile some experienced assurance providers may be proficient in applying attestation standards\nto GHG emissions disclosures, other assurance providers may lack GHG emissions expertise.\nSimilarly, some service providers providing assurance may have expertise in GHG emissions but\nhave minimal assurance experience. Moreover, some service providers may use standards that\nare developed by accreditation bodies with notice and public comment and other robust due\nprocess procedures590 for standard setting, while other service providers may use privately\ndeveloped \u201cverification\u201d standards.591\nTo improve accuracy, comparability, and consistency with respect to the proposed GHG\nemissions disclosure, we are proposing to require a minimum level of attestation services for\naccelerated filers and large accelerated filers including: (1) limited assurance for Scopes 1 and 2\nemissions disclosure that scales up to reasonable assurance after a specified transition period; (2)\nminimum qualifications and independence requirements for the attestation service provider; and\n(3) minimum requirements for the accompanying attestation report. These proposed\nrequirements would be minimum standards that the GHG emissions attestation provider engaged\nby accelerated filers and large accelerated filers must meet, but, as mentioned above, would not\nprevent a registrant from obtaining a heightened level of assurance over its climate-related\ndisclosures (prior to the transition to reasonable assurance) or to obtain assurance over climate-\nrelated disclosures other than Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.\n590 See infra Section II.H.3.\n591 See, e.g., CAQ, S&P 500 and ESG Reporting (Aug. 9, 2021) (pointing to the use of assurance methodologies\ndeveloped by individual service providers, which in some cases were based on IAASB International Standard\non Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 with modifications).\n225\n\nBy specifying minimum standards for the attestation provided with respect to GHG\nemissions disclosure by accelerated filers and large accelerated filers, the proposed rules should\nimprove accuracy and consistency in the reporting of this information, while also providing\ninvestors with an enhanced level of reliability against which to evaluate the disclosure. In\naddition to the proposed minimum standards for attestation services, the proposed additional\ndisclosure requirements for registrants, described below, should further assist investors in\nunderstanding the qualifications and suitability of the GHG emissions attestation provider\nselected by the registrant, particularly in light of the broad spectrum of attestation providers that\nwould be permitted to provide attestation services under the proposed rules.\nAlthough we are proposing certain minimum standards for attestation services, this\nproposal does not aim to create or adopt a specific attestation standard for assuring GHG\nemissions, just as this proposal does not define a single methodology for calculating GHG\nemissions. This is because both the reporting and attestation landscapes are currently evolving\nand it would be premature to adopt one approach and potentially curtail future innovations in\nthese two areas. The evolving nature of GHG emissions calculations and attestation standards\ncould suggest that it may also be premature to require assurance. We are soliciting comment on\nthe feasibility of our proposal and will consider any public feedback received, but we have\npreliminarily determined that the phased-in approach that we are proposing, along with an\nextended period for disclosure compliance for accelerated filers, balances the benefits of third-\nparty review with the costs of seeking assurance in this evolving space.\nThe proposed minimum standards for attestation services and the proposed additional\ndisclosure requirements would not eliminate fragmentation with respect to assurance or obviate\nthe need for investors to assess and compare multiple attestation standards. Nevertheless, we\n226\n\nbelieve some flexibility in our approach is warranted at this time given the unique and evolving\nnature of third-party assurance for climate-related disclosures. We believe the proposed\nminimum standards and additional disclosure requirements would enable investors to better\nunderstand the assurance that has been provided.\nWe are cognizant of the fact that the calculation and disclosure of GHG emissions would\nbe new for many registrants, as would be the application of assurance standards to GHG\nemissions disclosure. For these reasons and the reasons discussed in greater detail below, we are\nproposing to require assurance (1) only for accelerated filers and large accelerated filers, (2) only\nwith respect to Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, and (3) with an initial transition period for\nlimited assurance and a subsequent transition period for reasonable assurance.\nAlthough we have considered the challenges that mandatory assurance of GHG emissions\ndisclosure could present, accelerated filers and large accelerated filers should have the necessary\nresources to devote to complying with such requirements over the proposed implementation\ntimetable. For the many large accelerated filers that are already voluntarily obtaining some form\nof assurance over their GHG emissions, any cost increases associated with complying with the\nproposed rules would be mitigated.592 Furthermore, larger issuers generally bear proportionately\n592 See, e.g., CAQ, S&P 500 and ESG Reporting (Aug. 9, 2021) (providing statistics on limited assurance versus\nreasonable assurance obtained voluntarily in the current market (e.g., at least 26 of 31 companies that obtained\nassurance from public company auditors obtained limited assurance; at least 174 of 235 companies that\nobtained assurance or verification from other service providers (non-public company auditors) obtained limited\nassurance)). For similar information on the S&P 100, see CAQ, S&P 100 and ESG Reporting (Apr. 29, 2021),\navailable at https://www.thecaq.org/sp-100-and-esg-reporting/. Based on an analysis by Commission staff on\nMar. 3, 2022, a substantial number of the S&P 500 companies (460+) are large accelerated filers and therefore\nwould be subject to the proposed assurance requirements.\n227\n\nlower compliance costs than smaller issuers due to the fixed cost components of such\ncompliance.593\nThe proposed transition periods would also provide existing accelerated filers and large\naccelerated filers one fiscal year to transition to limited assurance594 and two additional fiscal\nyears to transition to reasonable assurance.595 For existing accelerated filers, this transition\nperiod would be in addition to the one additional year they will have to comply with the Scopes 1\nand 2 emission disclosure requirements (compared to large accelerated filers). As such, these\nfilers would have significant time to develop processes to support their GHG emissions\ndisclosure requirements and the relevant DCP, as well as to adjust to the incremental costs and\nefforts associated with escalating levels of assurance. During this transition period, GHG\nemissions attestation providers would also have time to prepare themselves for providing such\nservices in connection with Commission filings.\nIn addition to the challenges posed by the newness of calculating and disclosing GHG\nemissions, we believe that only requiring assurance over Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions would\nbe appropriate because the emissions result directly or indirectly from facilities owned or\nactivities controlled by a registrant, which makes it relatively more accessible and easier to\nsubject to the registrant\u2019s DCP compared to Scope 3 data. Further, as discussed earlier, many\n593 See infra note 948 in Section IV.C of the Economic Analysis for further discussion on proportionate costs\nbetween different types of filers.\n594 See infra note 604 for a discussion of the key differences between limited and reasonable assurance\nengagements.\n595 By limiting the assurance requirements to accelerated filers and large accelerated filers, a new registrant would\nnot be required to provide assurance until it has been subject to the requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the\nExchange Act for a period of at least twelve calendar months and it has filed at least one annual report pursuant\nto Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. See 17 CFR 240.12b-2. Therefore, no registrant would be\nrequired to provide assurance covering its GHG emissions disclosure during an initial public offering.\nHowever, any registrant that voluntarily includes an attestation report for GHG emissions disclosure would be\nrequired to comply with proposed Item 1505(e).\n228\n\nregistrants already voluntarily seek assurance over their GHG emissions disclosure\n(predominately Scope 1 and Scope 2 disclosures),596 which further supports the feasibility and\nreadiness of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions disclosure for mandatory assurance. In contrast, we\nare not proposing to require assurance of Scope 3 emissions disclosure at this time because the\npreparation of such disclosure presents unique challenges.597 Depending on the size and\ncomplexity of a company and its value chain, the task of calculating Scope 3 emissions could be\nrelatively more burdensome and expensive than calculating Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. In\nparticular, it may be difficult to obtain activity data from suppliers, customers, and other third\nparties in a registrant\u2019s value chain, or to verify the accuracy of that information compared to\ndisclosures of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions data, which are more readily available to a\nregistrant.\nWe are proposing to require accelerated filers and large accelerated filers to obtain\nlimited assurance, with an eventual scaling up to reasonable assurance. The objective of a\nlimited assurance engagement is for the service provider to express a conclusion about whether it\n596 For specific examples, see, e.g., Etsy, Inc.

A reasonable assurance opinion provides positive assurance that the subject\nmatter is free from material misstatement.600\nReasonable assurance is feasible whenever limited assurance can be provided on a\nsubject,601 and as noted above the voluntary attestation obtained by some registrants has been at\nthe reasonable assurance level.602 We understand, however, that a limited assurance engagement\n598 See, e.g., AICPA\u2019s Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No.22, AT-C Section 210.\n599 See infra Section II.H.3 for further discussion of the attestation report requirements, including the difference\nbetween a conclusion and an opinion.\n600 See, e.g., AICPA SSAE No. 21, AT-C Sections 205 and 206.\n601 Under commonly used attestation standards, both a reasonable assurance engagement and a limited assurance\nengagement have the same requirement that the subject matter (e.g., Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions) of the\nengagement be appropriate as a precondition for providing assurance. Thus, if the subject matter is appropriate\nfor a limited assurance engagement, it is also appropriate for a reasonable assurance engagement. See AICPA\nSSAE No. 18 (Apr. 2016); and IAASB ISAE 3000 (Revised) (Dec. 2013).\n602 For example, some registrants have voluntarily sought reasonable assurance over certain information, including\nScopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions, for which others have voluntarily sought limited assurance. See, e.g., Apple, Inc.\nEnvironmental Progress Report (Mar. 2021), at 88-90, available at\nhttps://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apple_Environmental_Progress_Report_2021.pdf; United Parcel\nService, Inc.

Moreover, under\nthe proposed rules, accelerated filers and large accelerated filers would not be prevented from\nobtaining reasonable assurance for their climate disclosures earlier than required. After the\ntransition to mandatory reasonable assurance, investors would have the benefits of a higher level\nof assurance with smaller incremental costs to accelerated filers and large accelerated filers than\nmoving directly to a reasonable assurance requirement.\n603 See supra note 592 (providing statistics on limited assurance obtained voluntarily in the current market).\n604 The scope of work in a limited assurance engagement is substantially less than a reasonable assurance\nengagement. The primary difference between the two levels of assurance relates to the nature, timing, and\nextent of procedures required to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to support the limited assurance\nconclusion or reasonable assurance opinion. Limited assurance engagements primarily include procedures such\nas inquiries and analytical procedures and do not necessarily include a consideration of whether internal\ncontrols have been effectively designed, whereas reasonable assurance engagements require the assurance\nservice provider to consider and obtain an understanding of internal controls. More extensive testing\nprocedures beyond inquiries and analytical procedures, including recalculation and verification of data inputs,\nare also required in reasonable assurance engagements, such as inspecting source documents that support\ntransactions selected on a sample basis. Driven by these differences, the cost of limited assurance is generally\nlower than that of reasonable assurance.\n605 See letters from CAQ and Energy Infrastructure Council; supra note 592 (providing statistics on voluntary\nassurance obtained by S&P 100 and S&P 500 companies).\n231\n\nRequest for Comment\n135. Should we require accelerated filers and large accelerated filers to obtain an attestation\nreport covering their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions disclosure, as proposed? Should we\nrequire accelerated filers and large accelerated filers to obtain an attestation report\ncovering other aspects of their climate-related disclosures beyond Scope 1 and 2\nemissions? For example, should we also require the attestation of GHG intensity metrics,\nor of Scope 3 emissions, if disclosed? Conversely, should we require accelerated filers\nand large accelerated filers to obtain assurance covering only Scope 1 emissions\ndisclosure? Should any voluntary assurance obtained by these filers after limited\nassurance is required be required to follow the same attestation requirements of Item\n1505(b)\u2013(d), as proposed?\n136. If we required accelerated filers and large accelerated filers to obtain an attestation report\ncovering Scope 3 emissions disclosure, should the requirement be phased-in over time? If\nso, what time frame? Should we require all Scope 3 emissions disclosure to be subject to\nassurance or only certain categories of Scope 3 emissions? Would it be possible for\naccelerated filers and large accelerated filers to obtain an attestation report covering the\nprocess or methodology for calculating Scope 3 emissions rather than obtaining an\nattestation report covering the calculations of Scope 3 emissions? Alternatively, is there\nanother form of verification over Scope 3 disclosure that would be more appropriate than\nobtaining an attestation report?\n137. Should the attestation requirement be limited to accelerated filers and large accelerated\nfilers, as proposed? Alternatively, should the attestation requirement be limited to a subset\nof accelerated filers and large accelerated filers? If so, what conditions should apply?\n232\n\nShould the attestation requirement only apply to well-known seasoned issuers?606 Should\nthe attestation requirement also apply to other types of registrants? Should we create a\nnew test for determining whether the attestation requirements apply to a registrant that\nwould take into account the resources of the registrant and also apply to initial public\nofferings? For example, should we create a test similar to the SRC definition,607 which\nincludes a separate determination for initial registration statements, but using higher\npublic float and annual revenue amounts?\n138. Instead of requiring only accelerated filers and large accelerated filers to include an\nattestation report for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, should the proposed attestation\nrequirements also apply to registrants other than accelerated filers and large accelerated\nfilers? If so, should the requirement apply only after a specified transition period? Should\nsuch registrants be required to provide assurance at the same level as accelerated filers and\nlarge accelerated filers and over the same scope of GHG emissions disclosure, or should\nwe impose lesser requirements (e.g., only limited assurance and/or assurance over Scope 1\nemissions disclosure only)?\n139. Should we require accelerated filers and large accelerated filers to initially include\nattestation reports reflecting attestation engagements at a limited assurance level,\neventually increasing to a reasonable assurance level, as proposed? What level of\nassurance should apply to the proposed GHG emissions disclosure, if any, and when\nshould that level apply? Should we provide a one fiscal year transition period between the\nGHG emissions disclosure compliance date and when limited assurance would be required\n606 See 17 CFR 230.405 (defining \u201cwell-known seasoned issuer\u201d).\n607 See, e.g., 17 CFR 240.12b-2.\n233\n\nfor accelerated filers and large accelerated filers, as proposed? Should we provide an\nadditional two fiscal year transition period between when limited assurance is first\nrequired and when reasonable assurance is required for accelerated filers and large\naccelerated filers, as proposed?\n140. Should we provide the same transition periods (from the Scopes 1 and 2 emissions\ndisclosure compliance date) for accelerated filers and large accelerated filers, as proposed?\nInstead, should different transition periods apply to accelerated filers and large accelerated\nfilers? Should we provide transition periods with different lengths than those proposed?\nShould we require the attestation to be at a reasonable assurance level without having a\ntransition period where only limited assurance is required? Should we instead impose\nassurance requirements to coincide with reporting compliance periods?\n141. Under prevailing attestation standards, \u201climited assurance\u201d and \u201creasonable assurance\u201d\nare defined terms that we believe are generally understood in the marketplace, both by\nthose seeking and those engaged to provide such assurance. As a result, we have not\nproposed definitions of those terms. Should we define \u201climited assurance\u201d and\n\u201creasonable assurance\u201d and, if so, how should we define them? Would providing\ndefinitions in this context cause confusion in other attestation engagements not covered by\nthe proposed rules? Are the differences between these types of attestation engagements\nsufficiently clear without providing definitions?\n142. As proposed, there would be no requirement for a registrant to either provide a separate\nassessment and disclosure of the effectiveness of controls over GHG emissions disclosure\nby management or obtain an attestation report from a GHG emissions attestation provider\nspecifically covering the effectiveness of controls over GHG emissions disclosure.\n234\n\nShould we require accelerated filers and large accelerated filers to provide a separate\nmanagement assessment and disclosure of the effectiveness of controls over GHG\nemissions disclosure (separate from the existing requirements with respect to the\nassessment and effectiveness of DCP)? Should we require management to provide a\nstatement in their annual report on their responsibility for the design and evaluation of\ncontrols over GHG emissions disclosure and to disclose their conclusion regarding the\neffectiveness of such controls? Instead of, or in addition to, such management assessment\nand statement, should we require the registrant to obtain an attestation report from a GHG\nemissions attestation provider that covers the effectiveness of such GHG emissions\ncontrols as of the date when the accelerated filer or large accelerated filer is required to\ncomply with the reasonable assurance requirement under proposed Item 1505(a)? If so:\n(i) Would it be confusing to apply either such requirement in light of the existing DCP\nrequirements that would apply to the proposed GHG emissions disclosure?\n(ii) Would a separate management assessment and statement on the effectiveness of\ncontrols over GHG emissions provide meaningful disclosure to investors beyond the\nexisting requirement for DCP?\n(iii) Should we specify that the separate management assessment and statement must be\nprovided by the accelerated filer\u2019s or large accelerated filer\u2019s principal executive and\nprincipal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions? Should we\nclarify which members of the accelerated filer or large accelerated filer\u2019s\nmanagement should be involved in performing the underlying assessment?\n(iv) What controls framework(s) would the effectiveness of the registrant\u2019s controls over\nGHG emissions disclosure be evaluated against, if any?\n235\n\n(v) For the GHG emissions attestation provider, what requirements should be applied to\nsuch GHG emissions disclosure controls attestation requirement? For example, what\nattestation standards should apply? Should other service provider(s) in addition to or\nin lieu of the GHG emissions attestation provider be permitted to provide such\nattestation over the effectiveness of the GHG controls?\n(vi) Should we limit such a requirement to accelerated filers and large accelerated filers\nonly or should it apply to other registrants as well?\n(vii) What would be the potential benefits and costs of either approach?\n(viii) Should we require a certification on the design and evaluation of controls over GHG\nemissions disclosures by officers serving in the principal executive and principal\nfinancial officer roles or persons performing similar functions for an accelerated filer\nor large accelerated filer? Would a certification requirement have any additional\nbenefits or impose any additional costs when compared to a requirement for\nmanagement to assess and disclose in a statement in the annual report the\neffectiveness of controls over GHG emissions?\n143. We considered whether to require registrants to include the GHG emissions metrics in\nthe notes or a separate schedule to their financial statements, by amending Regulation S-X\ninstead of Regulation S-K.\n(i) Would there be benefits to including this information in a registrant\u2019s financial\nstatements? For example, would requiring the GHG emissions disclosure to be\nincluded in the financial statements improve the consistency, comparability, reliability,\nand decision-usefulness of the information for investors? Would it facilitate the\nintegration of GHG metrics and targets into the registrant\u2019s financial analysis? Would\n236\n\nsuch placement cause registrants to incur significantly more expense in obtaining an\naudit of the disclosure? If so, please quantify those additional expenses where\npossible.\n(ii) Should we require a registrant to include the GHG emissions disclosure in its audited\nfinancial statements so that the disclosure would be subject to the existing\nrequirements for an independent audit and ICFR? If so, we seek comment on the\nfollowing aspects of this alternative:\n(a) If GHG emissions disclosure is subject to ICFR, or an internal control framework\nsimilar to ICFR, would GHG emissions disclosure be more reliable compared to\nwhat is currently proposed? What are the benefits or costs?\n(b) Should the GHG emissions disclosure be included in a note to the registrant\u2019s\nfinancial statements (e.g., in the note where the proposed financial statement\nmetrics as discussed above in Section II.F would be included) or in a schedule, or\nsomewhere else? If the GHG emissions disclosure was required in the financial\nstatements, should it be subject to a reasonable assurance audit like the other\ninformation in the financial statements? If in a schedule, should the GHG\nemissions disclosure be disclosed in a schedule similar to those required under\nArticle 12 of Regulation S-X, which would subject the disclosure to audit and\nICFR requirements? Should we instead require the metrics to be disclosed as\nsupplemental financial information, similar to the disclosure requirements under\nFASB ASC Topic 932-235-50-2 for registrants that have significant oil- and gas-\nproducing activities? If so, should such supplemental schedule be subject to ICFR\nrequirements? Instead of requiring the GHG emissions disclosure to be included\n237\n\nin a note to the registrant\u2019s audited financial statements, should we require a new\nfinancial statement for such metrics?\n(c) PCAOB auditing standards apply to the audit of a registrant\u2019s financial statements.\nIf GHG emissions disclosure is included in a supplemental schedule to the\nfinancial statements, should we allow other auditing standards to be applied? If so,\nwhich ones? What, if any, additional guidance or revisions to such standards\nwould be needed in order to apply them to the audit of GHG emissions disclosure?\n(d) What are the costs and benefits of employing registered public accounting firms to\nperform audits of GHG emissions disclosure and related attestation of internal\ncontrols? Are there potential cost savings in employing registered public\naccountants that currently perform audits of financial statements and attestation of\nICFR to review GHG emissions disclosure and any related internal controls? If we\nrequire GHG emissions disclosure to be presented in the financial statements,\nshould we permit entities other than registered public accounting firms to provide\nassurance of this information, as proposed for the current attestation requirements\nunder Regulation S-K? If not limited to registered public accounting firms, who\nshould be permitted to provide assurance of GHG emissions disclosure? Should we\npermit environmental consultants, engineering firms, or other types of specialists\nto provide assurance? What are the costs and benefits of such approach? Would\nthe reliability of the audits and therefore the information disclosed be affected if\nassurance providers other than registered public accounting firms are permitted to\nconduct these audits? Please provide supporting data where possible. If we should\nallow for assurance providers that are not registered public accounting firms, what\n238"

What expertise,\nindependence and quality control standards should apply?\n(e) What would be the other potential benefits and costs of such an approach?\n2. GHG Emissions Attestation Provider Requirements\nThe proposed rules would require the GHG emissions attestation report required by\nproposed Item 1505(a) for accelerated filers and large accelerated filers to be prepared and\nsigned by a GHG emissions attestation provider.608 The proposed rules would define a GHG\nemissions attestation provider to mean a person or a firm that has all of the following\ncharacteristics:\n\u2022 Is an expert in GHG emissions by virtue of having significant experience in measuring,\nanalyzing, reporting, or attesting to GHG emissions. Significant experience means\nhaving sufficient competence and capabilities necessary to:\no perform engagements in accordance with professional standards and applicable legal\nand regulatory requirements; and\no enable the service provider to issue reports that are appropriate under the\ncircumstances.609\n608 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(b).\n609 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(b)(1).\n239\n\n\u2022 Is independent with respect to the registrant, and any of its affiliates,610 for whom it is\nproviding the attestation report, during the attestation and professional engagement\nperiod.611\nThe proposed expertise requirement is intended to help ensure that the service provider\npreparing the attestation report has sufficient competence and capabilities necessary to execute\nthe attestation engagement. In this regard, if the service provider is a firm, we would expect that\nit have policies and procedures designed to provide it with reasonable assurance that the\npersonnel selected to conduct the GHG emissions attestation engagement have significant\nexperience with respect to both attestation engagements and GHG disclosure. This would mean\nthat the service provider has the qualifications necessary for fulfillment of the responsibilities\nthat it would be called on to assume, including the appropriate engagement of specialists, if\nneeded.612 The proposed expertise requirement would apply to the person or the firm signing the\nGHG emissions attestation report.613\n610 \u201cAffiliates,\u201d for purposes of proposed 17 CFR 229.1505 has the meaning provided in 17 CFR 210.2-01, except\nreferences to \u201caudit\u201d are deemed to be references to the attestation services provided pursuant to this section.\nSee proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(b)(2)(iii).\n611 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(b)(2) and 229.1505(b)(2)(iv) (defining the term \u201cattestation and professional\nengagement period\u201d).\n612 Independent auditors and accountants are already required to comply with similar quality control and\nmanagement standards when providing audit and attest services under the PCAOB, AICPA, or IAASB\nstandards. See, e.g., PCAOB, Quality Control (QC) Standards Section 20 System of Quality Control for a CPA\nFirm\u2019s Accounting and Auditing Practice and Section 40 The Personnel Management Element of a Firm\u2019s\nSystem of Quality Control \u2013 Competencies Required by a Practitioner-in-Charge of an Attest Engagement,\navailable at https://pcaobus.org/oversight/standards/qc-standards; AICPA, QC Section 10, A Firm\u2019s System of\nQuality Control, available at https://us.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/research/standards/auditattest/\ndownloadabledocuments/qc-00010.pdf; and IAASB, International Standard on Quality Management 1, Quality\nManagement for Firms that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or Related\nServices Engagements, available at https://www.ifac.org/system/files/publications/files/IAASB-Quality-\nManagement-ISQM-1-Quality-Management-for-Firms.pdf.\n613 We have adopted similar expertise requirements in the past to determine eligibility to prepare a mining technical\nreport. Although also relating to technical, specialized disclosures, the mining technical report requirements\ndiffer in that such an engagement is not an assurance engagement. See Modernization of Property Disclosures\nfor Mining Registrants, Release No. 33-10570 (Oct. 31, 2018), [83 FR 66344 (Dec. 26, 2018)].\n240\n\nThe second proposed requirement is modeled on the Commission\u2019s qualifications for\naccountants under 17 CFR 210.2-01 (Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X), which are designed to\nensure that auditors are independent of their audit clients. Similar to how assurance provided by\nindependent public accountants improves the reliability of financial statements and disclosures\nand is a critical component of our capital markets, assurance of GHG emissions disclosure by\nindependent service providers should also improve the reliability of such disclosure. Academic\nstudies demonstrate that assurance provided by an independent auditor reduces the risk that an\nentity provides materially inaccurate information to external parties, including investors, by\nfacilitating the dissemination of transparent and reliable financial information.614 We expect that\nGHG emissions disclosure would similarly benefit if assured by an independent service provider.\nMoreover, the potential conflicts of interest, or even the appearance of such conflicts of interest,\nbetween the GHG emissions attestation provider and the registrant could raise doubts for\ninvestors about whether they can rely on the attestation service and its report.\nSimilar to Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X,615 the proposed rules would provide that a GHG\nemissions attestation provider is not independent if during the attestation and professional\nengagement period such attestation provider is not, or a reasonable investor with knowledge of\nall relevant facts and circumstances would conclude that such attestation provider is not, capable\nof exercising objective and impartial judgment on all issues encompassed within the attestation\n614 See Mark Defond & Jieying Zhang, A Review of Archival Auditing Research, 58 J. ACCT. & ECON., 275 (2014);\nQualifications of Accountants, Release No. 33-10876 (Oct. 16, 2020) [85 FR 80508 (Dec. 11, 2020)], at 80508\n(\u201cThe Commission has long recognized that an audit by an objective, impartial, and skilled professional\ncontributes to both investor protection and investor confidence\u201d). See also Statement of Paul Munter, Acting\nChief Accountant, The Importance of High Quality Independent Audits and Effective Audit Committee\nOversight to High Quality Financial Reporting to Investors (Oct. 26, 2021).\n615 See 17 CFR 210.2-01(b).\n241\n\nprovider\u2019s engagement.616 The proposed definition for the attestation and professional\nengagement period, which is modeled on Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X, includes both (1) the\nperiod covered by the attestation report and (2) the period of the engagement to attest to the\nregistrant\u2019s GHG emissions or to prepare a report filed with the Commission (the \u201cprofessional\nengagement period\u201d). Under the proposed rules, the professional engagement period would\nbegin when the GHG attestation service provider either signs an initial engagement letter (or\nother agreement to attest to a registrant\u2019s GHG emissions) or begins attest procedures, whichever\nis earlier.617\nThe proposed rules would further state that, in determining whether a GHG emissions\nattestation provider is independent, the Commission will consider:\n\u2022 whether a relationship or the provision of a service creates a mutual or conflicting interest\nbetween the attestation provider and the registrant (or any of its affiliates), places the\nattestation provider in the position of attesting to such attestation provider\u2019s own work,\nresults in the attestation provider acting as management or an employee of the registrant\n(or any of its affiliates), or places the attestation provider in a position of being an\nadvocate for the registrant (or any of its affiliates);618 and\n\u2022 all relevant circumstances, including all financial or other relationships between the\nattestation provider and the registrant (or any of its affiliates), and not just those relating\nto reports filed with the Commission.619\n616 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(b)(2)(i).\n617 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(b)(2)(iv).\n618 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(b)(2)(ii)(A).\n619 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(b)(2)(ii)(B).\n242\n\nThese proposed provisions are modeled on the factors used by the Commission in\ndetermining whether an accountant is independent.620 Similar to Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X,\nthe proposed provisions should help protect investors by requiring the GHG emissions attestation\nprovider to be independent both in fact and appearance from the registrant, including its\naffiliates.\nBecause the GHG emissions attestation provider would be a person whose profession\ngives authority to the statements made in the attestation report and who is named as having\nprovided an attestation report that is part of the registration statement, the registrant would be\nrequired to obtain and include the written consent of the GHG emissions attestation provider\npursuant to Securities Act Section 7,621 the corresponding rule requiring the written consents of\nsuch experts,622 and the Regulation S-K provision requiring the attachment of the written consent\nof an expert to a Securities Act registration statement or an Exchange Act report that\nincorporates by reference a written expert report attached to a previously filed Securities Act\nregistration statement.623 The GHG emissions attestation provider would also be subject to\nliability under the federal securities laws for the attestation conclusion or, when applicable,\nopinion provided. Such liability should encourage the attestation service provider to exercise\ndue diligence with respect to its obligations under a limited or reasonable assurance engagement.\n620 See 17 CFR 210.2-01. For the avoidance of doubt, we note that if the independent accountant who audits the\nregistrant\u2019s consolidated financial statements is also engaged to perform the GHG emissions attestation for the\nsame filing, the fees associated with the GHG emissions attestation engagement would be considered \u201cAudit-\nRelated Fees\u201d for purposes of Item 9(e) of 17 CFR 240.14a-101, Item 14 of Form 10-K, Item 16C of Form 20-\nF, or any similar requirements.\n621 15 U.S.C. 77g.\n622 See 17 CFR 230.436.\n623 See 17 CFR 229.601(b)(23).\n243\n\nRequest for Comment\n144. Should we require a registrant to obtain a GHG emissions attestation report that is\nprovided by a GHG emissions attestation provider that meets specified requirements, as\nproposed? Should one of the requirements be that the attestation provider is an expert in GHG\nemissions, with significant experience in measuring, analyzing, reporting, or attesting to GHG\nemissions, as proposed? Should we specify that significant experience means having sufficient\ncompetence and capabilities necessary to: (a) perform engagements in accordance with\nprofessional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements and (b) enable the\nservice provider to issue reports that are appropriate under the circumstances, as proposed?\nShould we instead require that the GHG emissions attestation provider have a specified number\nof years of the requisite type of experience, such as 1, 3, 5, or more years? Should we specify\nthat a GHG emissions attestation provider meets the expertise requirements if it is a member in\ngood standing of a specified accreditation body that provides oversight to service providers that\napply attestation standards? If so, which accreditation body or bodies should we consider (e.g.,\nAICPA)? Are there any other requirements for the attestation provider that we should specify?\nInstead, should we require a GHG emissions attestation provider to be a PCAOB-registered audit\nfirm?\n145. Is additional guidance needed with respect to the proposed expertise requirement?\nShould we instead include prescriptive requirements related to the qualifications and\ncharacteristics of an expert under the proposed rules? For example, should we include a\nprovision that requires a GHG emissions attestation provider that is a firm to have established\npolicies and procedures designed to provide it with reasonable assurance that the personnel\nselected to provide the GHG attestation service have the qualifications necessary for fulfillment\n244\n\nof the responsibilities that the GHG emissions attestation provider will be called on to assume,\nincluding the appropriate engagement of specialists, if needed?\n146. Should we require the GHG emissions attestation provider to be independent with\nrespect to the registrant, and any of its affiliates, for whom it is providing the attestation report,\nas proposed? Should we specify that a GHG emissions attestation provider is not independent if\nsuch attestation provider is not, or a reasonable investor with knowledge of all relevant facts and\ncircumstances would conclude that such attestation provider is not, capable of exercising\nobjective and impartial judgment on all issues encompassed within the attestation provider\u2019s\nengagement, as proposed? The proposed provision is based on a similar provision regarding the\nqualification of an accountant to be an independent auditor under Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.\nIs Rule 2-01 an appropriate model for determining the independence of a GHG emissions\nattestation provider? Is being independent from a registrant and its affiliates an appropriate\nqualification for a GHG emissions attestation provider?\n147. Should we specify that the factors the Commission would consider in determining\nwhether a GHG emissions attestation provider is independent include whether a relationship or\nthe provision of a service creates a mutual or conflicting interest between the attestation provider\nand the registrant, including its affiliates, places the attestation provider in the position of\nattesting to such attestation provider\u2019s own work, results in the attestation provider acting as\nmanagement or an employee of the registrant, including its affiliates, or places the attestation\nprovider in a position of being an advocate for the registrant and its affiliates, as proposed?\nShould we specify that the Commission also will consider all relevant circumstances, including\nall financial and other relationships between the attestation provider and the registrant, including\nits affiliates, and not just those relating to reports filed with the Commission, as proposed?\n245\n\n148. Should we adopt all of the proposed factors for determining the independence of a GHG\nemissions attestation provider, or are there factors we should omit? Are there any additional\nfactors that we should specify that the Commission will consider when determining the\nindependence of a GHG emissions attestation provider? For example, should we include any\nnon-exclusive specifications of circumstances that would be inconsistent with the independence\nrequirements, similar to those provided in 17 CFR 210.2-01(c) (Rule 2-01(c) of Regulation S-\nX)?\n149. Should the definition of \u201caffiliates\u201d be modeled on Rule 2-01, as proposed, or should we\nuse a different definition? Would defining the term differently than proposed cause confusion\nbecause the rest of the proposed independence requirement is modeled on Rule 2-01? Many\naccountants are likely familiar with the proposed definition given their required compliance with\nRule 2-01, would non-accountants understand how to comply with and apply this concept?\n150. Should the term \u201cattestation and professional engagement period\u201d be defined in the\nproposed manner? If not, how should \u201cattestation and professional engagement period\u201d be\ndefined? Alternatively, should the Commission specify a different time period during which an\nattestation provider must meet the proposed independence requirements?\n151. Should we include disclosure requirements when there is a change in, or disagreement\nwith, the registrant\u2019s GHG emissions attestation provider that are similar to the disclosure\nrequirements in Item 4.01 of Form 8-K and 17 CFR 229.304 (Item 304 of Regulation S-K)?\n152. Accountants are already required to comply with the relevant quality control and\nmanagement standards when providing audit and attest services under the PCAOB, AICPA, or\nIAASB standards. These quality control and management standards would apply to accountants\nproviding GHG attestation services pursuant to those standards as well. Should we require the\n246"

If so, what should the minimum\nrequirements be?\n153. As proposed, the GHG emissions attestation provider would be a person whose\nprofession gives authority to statements made in the attestation report and who is named as\nhaving provided an attestation report that is part of the registration statement, and therefore the\nregistrant would be required to obtain and include the written consent of the GHG emissions\nprovider pursuant to Securities Act Section 7 and related Commission rules. This would subject\nthe GHG emissions attestation provider to potential liability under Section 11 of the Securities\nAct. Would the possibility of Section 11 liability deter qualified persons from serving as GHG\nemissions attestation providers? Should we include a provision similar to 17 CFR 230.436(c), or\namend that rule, to provide that a report on GHG emissions at the limited assurance level by a\nGHG emissions attestation provider that has reviewed such information is not considered part of\na registration statement prepared or certified by a person whose profession gives authority to a\nstatement made by him or a report prepared or certified by such person within the meaning of\nSection 7 and 11 of the Act?\n3. GHG Emissions Attestation Engagement and Report Requirements\nThe proposed rules would require the attestation report required by proposed Item\n1505(a) for accelerated filers and large accelerated filers to be included in the separately-\ncaptioned \u201cClimate-Related Disclosure\u201d section in the relevant filing and provided pursuant to\n247\n\nstandards that are publicly available at no cost and are established by a body or group that has\nfollowed due process procedures, including the broad distribution of the framework for public\ncomment.624 The requirement that the standards be established by a body or group that has\nfollowed due process procedures would be similar to the requirements for determining a suitable,\nrecognized control framework for use in management\u2019s evaluation of an issuer\u2019s ICFR.625 In\nboth cases, a specific framework is not prescribed but minimum requirements for what\nconstitutes a suitable framework are provided. This approach would help to ensure that the\nstandards upon which the attestation engagement and report are based are the result of a\ntransparent, public, and reasoned process. This requirement should also help to protect investors\nwho may rely on the attestation report by limiting the standards to those that have been\nsufficiently developed. Rather than prescribe a particular attestation standard, the proposed\napproach recognizes that more than one suitable attestation standard exists and that others may\ndevelop in the future.\n624 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(a)(2) and (c).\n625 See 17 CFR 240.13a-15(c) and 240.15d-15(c) (stating that the \u201cframework on which management\u2019s evaluation\nof the issuer\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is based must be a suitable, recognized control\nframework that is established by a body or group that has followed due-process procedures, including the broad\ndistribution of the framework for public comment\u201d).\n248\n\nIn our view, the attestation standards, for example, of the PCAOB,626 AICPA,627 and\nIAASB628 would meet this due process requirement. In addition, all of these attestation\nstandards are publicly available at no cost to investors who desire to review them. We believe\nthat open access is an important consideration when determining the suitability of attestation\nstandards for application to GHG emissions disclosure because it would enable investors to\nevaluate the report against the requirements of the selected attestation standard. By highlighting\nthese standards, we do not mean to imply that other standards currently used in voluntary\nreporting would not be suitable for use under the proposed rules. Our proposal intends to set\nminimum standards while acknowledging the current voluntary practices of registrants. As\nnoted below, we seek comment on whether other standards currently used in the voluntary\nclimate-related assurance market or that are otherwise under development would meet the\nproposed due process requirement and also be suitable for application to GHG emissions under\nthe Commission\u2019s proposed rules.\nThe proposed rules would not include any requirement for a registrant to obtain an\nattestation report covering the effectiveness of internal control over GHG emissions disclosure,\n626 See PCAOB AT Section 101, Attest Engagements, available at\nhttps://pcaobus.org/oversight/standards/attestation-standards/details/AT101.\n627 See AICPA SSAE No. 18 (general attestation standard), available at\nhttps://us.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/research/standards/auditattest/downloadabledocuments/ssae-no-18.pdf;\nSSAE No. 22, Review Engagements (limited assurance standard, effective for reports dated on or after June 15,\n2022), available at\nhttps://us.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/research/standards/auditattest/downloadabledocuments/ssae-22.pdf; and\nSSAE No. 21, Direct Examination Engagements (reasonable assurance standard, effective for reports dated on\nor after June 15, 2022 and will amend SSAE No. 18), available at\nhttps://us.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/research/standards/auditattest/downloadabledocuments/ssae-21.pdf.\n628 See IAASB ISAE 3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical\nFinancial Information, available at\nhttps://www.ifac.org/system/files/publications/files/ISAE%203000%20Revised%20-%20for%20IAASB.pdf. See\nalso IAASB ISAE 3410, Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements, available at\nhttps://www.ifac.org/system/files/publications/files/Basis%20for%20Conclusions%20-%20ISAE%203410%20\nAssurance%20Engagements%20on%20Greenhouse%20Gas%20Statements-final_0.pdf.\n249\n\nand therefore such a report would not be required even when the GHG emissions attestation\nengagement is performed at a reasonable assurance level. Given the current evolving state of\nGHG emissions reporting and assurance, we believe that existing DCP obligations, and the\nproposed requirement that accelerated filers and large accelerated filers initially obtain at least\nlimited assurance of such disclosure, are appropriate first steps toward enhancing the reliability\nof GHG emissions disclosure. We also note that, under prevailing attestation standards for\nlimited assurance engagements, the testing of and attestation over internal controls are not\nrequired.629 With respect to the eventual reasonable assurance engagements, while there are\nrequirements under prevailing attestation standards to consider and obtain an understanding of\ninternal controls, there is no required attestation of the effectiveness of internal controls such as\nthat included in Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley Act).630\nWe recognize that the attestation standards that a GHG emissions attestation provider\nmay use would have specific requirements for the form and content of attestation reports. The\nproposed rules would require a GHG emissions attestation provider to follow the specific\nrequirements regarding form and content of the reports set forth by the attestation standard (or\nstandards) used by such attestation provider.631 Nevertheless, in order to provide some\nstandardization and comparability of GHG emissions attestation reports, the proposed rules\nwould impose minimum requirements for the GHG emissions attestation report.632 In particular,\nsuch minimum report requirements would provide investors with consistent and comparable\n629 See, e.g., AICPA SSAE No. 22, AT-C \u00a7 210.A16.\n630 See 15 U.S.C. 7262(b) (requiring a registered public accounting firm that prepares or issues an audit report for\ncertain issuers to attest to, and report on, the assessment made by the management of the issuer with respect to\ninternal controls).\n631 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(c).\n632 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(c)(1) through (13).\n250\n\ninformation about the GHG emissions attestation engagement and report obtained by the\nregistrant when the engagement is conducted by a GHG emissions attestation provider using an\nattestation standard that may be less widely used or that has less robust report requirements than\nmore prevalent standards.\nThe proposed minimum attestation engagement and report requirements are primarily\nderived from the AICPA\u2019s attestation standards (e.g., SSAE No. 18), which are commonly used\nby accountants who currently provide GHG attestation engagement services as well as other non-\nGHG-related attestation engagement services, and are largely similar to the report requirements\nunder PCAOB AT-101 and IAASB ISAE 3410. Many of the following proposed minimum\nattestation report requirements are also elements of an accountant\u2019s report when attesting to\ninternal control over financial reporting, of an accountant\u2019s report on audited financial statements\n(which is conducted at a reasonable assurance level), or of a review report on interim financial\nstatements (which is conducted at a limited assurance level). We explain below each of the\nproposed minimum components of a GHG emissions attestation report. These are all common\nelements of current assurance reports and are also similar to elements of other expert reports and\nlegal opinions provided in Commission filings and other transactions.\nAs proposed, the GHG emissions attestation report would be required to include an\nidentification or description of the subject matter or assertion on which the attestation provider is\nreporting.633 For example, the attestation report would identify the subject matter as Scope 1 and\nScope 2 emissions disclosure. If a registrant voluntarily sought attestation of additional items of\ndisclosure, such as GHG intensity metrics or Scope 3 emissions, the attestation provider would\n633 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(c)(1).\n251\n\nbe required to identify those additional items as well in the attestation report. If a registrant has\nmade an assertion about the measurement or evaluation of the subject matter to the attestation\nprovider,634 the attestation report must include such assertion. For example, the attestation report\nmight refer to the registrant\u2019s assertion that the Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions disclosure\nincluded within the filing has been presented in accordance with Item 1504 of Regulation S-K.\nThese proposed minimum requirements would elicit information that is fundamental to\nunderstanding the attestation report and would clarify the scope of the attestation report when the\nscope does not align with the scope of the registrant\u2019s GHG emissions disclosure (e.g., when\nScope 3 emissions disclosure is included in the filing but not covered by the attestation report).\nThe proposed rules would also require the GHG emissions attestation report to include\nthe point in time or period of time to which the measurement or evaluation of the subject matter\nor assertion relates.635 Therefore, the attestation provider would be required to identify the time\nperiod to which the Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosure (or other additional disclosure) relates,\nwhich would be the registrant\u2019s most recently completed fiscal year or some other 12-month\nperiod if permitted under the applicable climate-related disclosure rules636 as well as any relevant\nhistorical period disclosure included within the filing. This proposed requirement seeks to avoid\nany confusion investors may have about which period or periods of the climate-related\ndisclosures included within the filing are subject to the attestation.\n634 See, e.g., AICPA SSAE No. 22, AT-C \u00a7210.45(c); AICPA SSAE No. 21, AT-C \u00a7205.63(c).\n635 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(c)(1).\n636 As previously mentioned, we are soliciting comment regarding whether the GHG emissions should be reported\nas of fiscal year-end or some other 12-month period. See supra Section II.G.1.\n252\n\nThe proposed rules would also require the attestation report to identify the criteria against\nwhich the subject matter was measured or evaluated.637 For an attestation report solely covering\nScopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosure, the identified criteria would include the requirements in\nproposed Item 1504 of Regulation S-K and, in particular, Item 1504(a), which includes\npresentation requirements such as disaggregation by each constituent greenhouse gas. The\nidentified criteria would also include Item 1504(b) and the applicable instructions in Item\n1504(e) regarding methodology, organizational boundary, and operational boundary. In other\nwords, this minimum requirement would require an attestation provider to refer to the\nrequirements with which the registrant must comply when making the disclosure that is subject\nto the attestation. Without the frame of reference provided by the identified criteria, the\nconclusion or opinion included in the report may be open to individual interpretation and\nmisunderstanding by investors.\nPrevailing attestation standards require the criteria against which the subject matter is\nmeasured or evaluated to be \u201csuitable.\u201d In the context of the proposed rules, suitable criteria\nwould, when followed, result in reasonably consistent measurement or evaluation of the\nregistrant\u2019s disclosure that is within the scope of the engagement. Characteristics of suitable\ncriteria include relevance, objectivity, measurability, and completeness.638 We believe that\nproposed Item 1504 of Regulation S-K would satisfy the suitable criteria requirements of the\nprevailing attestation standards because the proposed requirements set forth relevant, objective\n637 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(c)(2).\n638 See, e.g., AICPA SSAE No. 18, AT-C \u00a7105.A16 and .A42; AICPA SSAE No. 21, AT-C \u00a7105.A16 and .A44.\nIn addition to relevance and completeness, the characteristics of suitable criteria under ISAE 3000.A23 include\nreliability, neutrality and understandability. Despite the differences in the characteristics listed, the underlying\nconcepts and objectives are consistent.\n253\n\nstandards that call for measurable and complete disclosure of GHG emissions that would allow\nfor a consistent evaluation of the registrant\u2019s disclosure.\nThe GHG emissions attestation report would further be required to include a statement\nthat identifies the level of assurance provided and describes the nature of the attestation\nengagement.639 For example, under the proposed rule, an attestation report providing limited\nassurance would need to include not only a statement that limited assurance is the provided level\nof assurance, but also would need to describe the scope of work performed in a limited assurance\nengagement, which typically would indicate that the procedures performed vary in nature,\ntiming, and extent compared to a reasonable assurance engagement. This proposed minimum\nrequirement would help investors understand the level of assurance provided.\nThe proposed rules would require the attestation report to include a statement that\nidentifies the attestation standard (or standards) used.640 As previously discussed, the standard\nused must be publicly available at no cost and have been established by a body or group that has\nfollowed due process procedures, including the broad distribution of the framework for public\ncomment.641 This minimum report requirement would allow investors to easily identify the\nattestation standard that the engagement is executed against, which is particularly important\nbecause the proposed rules do not prescribe a particular attestation standard. Understanding the\nattestation standard used would allow investors to better understand the attestation performed by\nevaluating the report against the attestation standard\u2019s requirements and would facilitate\ncomparability across the attestation reports of different registrants.\n639 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(c)(3).\n640 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(c)(4).\n641 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(a)(2).\n254\n\nThe attestation report would also be required to include a statement that describes the\nregistrant\u2019s responsibility to report on the subject matter or assertion being reported on in order\nto make it clear to investors who is ultimately responsible for the disclosure.642 At a minimum,\nthis proposed provision would require a statement that the registrant is responsible for the subject\nmatter, or its assertion on the subject matter. This proposed requirement, like all of the minimum\nrequirements, has corollaries outside of the GHG emissions context. For example, an\nindependent auditor\u2019s audit report on a registrant\u2019s financial statements is required to include a\nstatement that the registrant\u2019s management is responsible for the financial statements that are\nbeing audited.643\nThe proposed rules would further require the attestation report to include a statement that\ndescribes the attestation provider\u2019s responsibilities in connection with the preparation of the\nattestation report.644 This is consistent with existing requirements in reports such as those issued\nby the independent auditor on the audited financial statements or a review report on the interim\nfinancial statements. For example, with respect to a limited assurance engagement, under\nprevailing attestation standards, the report would typically include a statement that the attestation\nprovider\u2019s responsibilities include expressing a conclusion on the subject matter or the assertion\nbased on the attestation provider\u2019s review.645 Similarly, for a reasonable assurance engagement,\nthe report would typically include a statement that the attestation provider\u2019s responsibilities\n642 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(c)(5).\n643 See, e.g., PCAOB AS 3101, par. 9(a).\n644 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(c)(6).\n645 See, e.g., AICPA SSAE No.22, AT-C sec. 210.45(f).\n255\n\ninclude expressing an opinion on the subject matter or assertion, based on the attestation\nprovider\u2019s examination.646\nThe proposed rules would also require the attestation report to include a statement that\nthe attestation provider is independent, as required by proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(a).647 Because\nindependence from the registrant, including its affiliates, would be a necessary qualification for\nthe GHG emissions attestation provider,648 the attestation report would be required to include the\nattestation provider\u2019s confirmation of his or her compliance with the proposed independence\nrequirement.\nThe proposed rules would further require the attestation report, for a limited assurance\nengagement, to include a description of the work performed as a basis for the attestation\nprovider\u2019s conclusion.649 This proposed provision is intended to enhance the transparency of the\nGHG emissions attestation report for investors by eliciting disclosure about the procedures\nundertaken by the attestation provider in its limited assurance engagement, such as inquiries and\nanalytical procedures. This information would allow investors to assess and understand the\nextent of procedures performed to support the conclusion reached by the attestation provider,\nwhich could also facilitate an investor\u2019s comparison of different attestation reports provided\nunder the same or different attestation standards.\nThe GHG emissions attestation report would also be required to include a statement that\ndescribes any significant inherent limitations associated with the measurement or evaluation of\n646 See, e.g., AICPA SSAE No. 21, AT-C sec. 205.63(f) and sec. 206.12(e)(ii).\n647 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(c)(7).\n648 See supra Section II.H.2.\n649 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(c)(8).\n256\n\nthe subject matter (at a minimum, Scopes 1 and 2 emissions) against the criteria (i.e., the\napplicable requirements in proposed Item 1504).650 Such a statement is a common characteristic\nof attestation reports, including the independent auditor\u2019s report on internal control over financial\nreporting. This proposed provision is intended to elicit disclosure about the estimation\nuncertainties inherent in the quantification of GHG emissions, driven by reasons such as the state\nof the science, methodology, and assumptions used in the measurement and reporting processes.\nFor example, an attestation provider might include in its report a statement about measurement\nuncertainty resulting from accuracy and precision of GHG emission conversion factors.\nThe proposed rules would require the GHG emissions attestation report to include the\nattestation provider\u2019s conclusion or opinion, as applicable, based on the attestation standard(s)\nused.651 For a limited assurance engagement, under prevailing attestation standards, the\nconclusion would typically state whether the provider is aware of any material modifications that\nshould be made to the subject matter in order for the disclosure to be in accordance with (or\nbased on) the requirements specified in Item 1504, or for the registrant\u2019s assertion about such\nsubject matter to be fairly stated.652 For a reasonable assurance engagement, the attestation\nprovider would typically provide an opinion on whether the subject matter is in accordance with\n(or based on) the requirements specified in Item 1504 in all material respects, or that the\nregistrant\u2019s assertion about its subject matter is fairly stated, in all material respects.653\n650 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(c)(9).\n651 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(c)(10).\n652 See, e.g., AICPA SSAE No. 22, AT-C sec. 210.45(l).\n653 See, e.g., AICPA SSAE No. 21 AT-C sec. 205.63(k) and sec. 206.12(j).\n257\n\nFinally, the proposed rules would require the GHG emissions attestation report to include\nthe signature of the attestation provider (whether by an individual or a person signing on behalf\nof the attestation provider\u2019s firm),654 the city and state where the attestation report has been\nissued,655 and the date of the report.656 These are all common elements of current assurance and\nexpert reports, and each of these proposed provisions would help to identify and confirm the\nvalidity of the GHG emissions attestation provider.\nRequest for Comment\n154. Should we require the attestation engagement and related attestation report to be\nprovided pursuant to standards that are publicly available at no cost and are established by a\nbody or group that has followed due process procedures, including the broad distribution of the\nframework for public comment, as proposed? Is the requirement of \u201cdue process procedures,\nincluding the broad distribution of the framework for public comment\u201d sufficiently clear?\nWould the attestation standards of the PCAOB, AICPA, and IAASB meet this due process\nrequirement? Are there other standards currently used in the voluntary climate-related assurance\nmarket or otherwise in development that would meet the due process and publicly availability\nrequirements? For example, would verification standards commonly used by non-accountants\ncurrently, such as ISO 14064-3 and the AccountAbility\u2019s AA1000 Series of Standards, meet the\nproposed requirements? Are there standards currently used in the voluntary climate-related\nassurance market or otherwise under development that would be appropriate for use under the\nCommission\u2019s climate-related disclosure rules although they may not strictly meet the proposed\n654 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(c)(11).\n655 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(c)(12).\n656 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(c)(13).\n258\n\npublic comment requirement? If so, please explain whether those standards have other\ncharacteristics that would serve to protect investors?\n155. Should we require that the attestation standards used be publicly available at no cost to\ninvestors, as proposed? Should we permit the use of attestation standards, even if not publicly\navailable at no cost, provided that registrants provide access to those standards at the request of\ntheir investors?\n156. Should we require the GHG emissions attestation report to meet certain minimum\nrequirements in addition to any form and content requirements set forth by the attestation\nstandard or standards used by the GHG emissions attestation provider, as proposed? Should we\ninstead require that the attestation report solely meet whatever requirements are established by\nthe attestation standard or standards used?\n157. Should we adopt each of the proposed minimum requirements? Are there any proposed\nrequirements that we should omit or add to the proposed list of minimum GHG emissions\nattestation report requirements?\n158. Regarding the proposed provision requiring the identification of the criteria against\nwhich the subject matter was measured or evaluated, would reference to proposed Item 1504(a),\nItem 1504(b), and Item 1504(e)\u2019s instructions concerning the presentation, methodology,\nincluding underlying assumptions, and organizational and operational boundaries applicable to\nthe determination of Scopes 1 and 2 emissions meet the \u201csuitable criteria\u201d requirement under\nprevailing attestation standards (e.g., AICPA SSAE No. 18, AT-C 105.A16)?\n159. If we require or permit a registrant to use the GHG Protocol as the methodology for\ndetermining GHG emissions, would the provisions of the GHG Protocol qualify as \u201csuitable\ncriteria\u201d against which the Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions disclosure should be evaluated?\n259"

    "text": "4. Additional Disclosure by the Registrant\nIn addition to the minimum attestation report requirements described above, which reflect\nthe contents of attestation reports under prevailing attestation standards, we are proposing to\nrequire disclosure by the registrant of certain additional matters related to the attestation of a\nregistrant\u2019s GHG emissions.657 These disclosures are not typically included in an attestation\nreport, and would not be included in the GHG emissions attestation report under the proposed\nrules. Instead, the registrant would be required to provide these disclosures in the separately\ncaptioned \u201cClimate-Related Disclosure\u201d section, where the GHG emissions disclosure would be\nprovided pursuant to the proposed rules.658\nThese proposed additional disclosures should assist investors in evaluating the\nqualifications of the GHG emissions attestation provider selected by the registrant, particularly in\nlight of the broad spectrum of attestation providers that would be permitted to provide an\nattestation report under the proposed rules.659\nWe considered requiring the proposed disclosures to be provided in the attestation report\nbut are not proposing to do so because we are concerned such an approach may create confusion\nby conflicting with prevalent attestation standards. Furthermore, in light of the variety of\nattestation service providers the registrant is permitted to engage, requiring the registrant to\nprovide such disclosures may allow the registrant to better provide its investors with relevant\ninformation about the qualifications of the service provider that the registrant engaged for the\nGHG emissions attestation.\n657 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(d).\n658 See id.\n659 See supra Section II.H.2.\n260\n\nWith respect to the Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions attestation required pursuant to\nproposed Item 1505(a) for accelerated filers and large accelerated filers,660 the registrant would\nbe required to disclose in the filing, based on relevant information obtained from any GHG\nemissions attestation provider:\n\u2022 Whether the attestation provider has a license from any licensing or accreditation body to\nprovide assurance, and if so, the identity of the licensing or accreditation body, and\nwhether the attestation provider is a member in good standing of that licensing or\naccreditation body;661\n\u2022 Whether the GHG emissions attestation engagement is subject to any oversight\ninspection program, and if so, which program (or programs);662 and\n\u2022 Whether the attestation provider is subject to record-keeping requirements with respect to\nthe work performed for the GHG emissions attestation engagement and, if so, identify the\nrecord-keeping requirements and the duration of those requirements.663\nThe first two above items of disclosure would help investors better understand the\nqualifications of the GHG emissions attestation provider, which in turn could help them assess\nthe reliability of the attestation results. An example of a license from a licensing or accreditation\nbody to provide assurance would be a Certified Public Accountant license issued by a state board\nof accountancy (e.g., the California Board of Accountancy), while an example of oversight\nprograms would include the AICPA peer review program, among others. The proposed\n660 If an accelerated filer or a large accelerated filer voluntarily obtains assurance beyond what would be required\nby proposed Item 1505(a) and uses a different service provider for such assurance, it would also be required to\nprovide the information required by proposed Item 1505(d) for such service provider.\n661 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(d)(1).\n662 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(d)(2).\n663 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(d)(3).\n261\n\ndisclosure requirement about any record-keeping requirements to which the attestation provider\nis subject would help enhance the transparency of the attestation process by providing investors\nwith information about the business practices of the attestation provider that has been retained by\nthe registrant.664\nRequest for Comment\n160. Should we require certain items of disclosure related to the attestation of a registrant\u2019s\nGHG emissions to be provided by the registrant in its filing that includes the attestation report\n(where the GHG emissions and other climate-related disclosures are presented), based on\nrelevant information obtained from the GHG emissions attestation provider, as proposed?\nShould these additional items of disclosure instead be included in the attestation report?\n161. Should we require the registrant to disclose whether the attestation provider has a\nlicense from any licensing or accreditation body to provide assurance, and if so, the identity of\nthe licensing or accreditation body, and whether the attestation provider is a member in good\nstanding of that licensing or accreditation body, as proposed? In lieu of disclosure, should we\nrequire a GHG emissions attestation provider to be licensed to provide assurance by specified\nlicensing or accreditation bodies? If so, which licensing or accreditation bodies should we\nspecify?\n162. Should we require a registrant to disclose whether the GHG emissions attestation\nengagement is subject to any oversight inspection program, and if so, which program (or\nprograms), as proposed? Should we instead require the registrant to disclose whether the\n664 For example, the AICPA imposes a minimum five-year documentation retention program for an audit. See AU-\nC 230.17.

Targets and Goals Disclosure\nIf a registrant has set any climate-related targets or goals, then the proposed rules would\nrequire the registrant to provide certain information about those targets or goals.672 Those goals\n672 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1506(a)(1).\n266\n\nor targets might, for example, relate to the reduction of GHG emissions, or address energy\nusage,673 water usage, conservation or ecosystem restoration. A registrant might also set goals\nwith regard to revenues from low-carbon products in line with anticipated regulatory\nrequirements, market constraints, or other goals established by a climate-related treaty, law,\nregulation, policy, or organization. The proposed disclosure requirements could help investors\nbetter understand the scope of a registrant\u2019s climate-related targets or goals, including those\nrelated to GHG emissions, and assist in assessing progress towards achieving those targets or\ngoals.\nMany commenters recommended that we require registrants to provide detailed\ninformation about their climate-related targets and goals, including action plans and timelines for\nachieving such targets as GHG emissions reductions and performance data measured against\nthose targets.674 This information could be important for investors in light of the fact that,\naccording to one publication, two-thirds of S&P 500 companies had set a carbon reduction target\nby the end of 2020.675 Despite the numerous commitments to reduce GHG emissions, according\nto several sources, many companies do not provide their investors with sufficient information to\nunderstand how the companies intend to achieve those commitments or the progress made\n673 For example, numerous companies have pledged to achieve 100% of the electricity used in their global\noperations from renewable sources by 2050. See RE100, What are the requirements to become a RE100\nmember?, available at https://www.there100.org/technical-guidance.\n674 See, e.g., letters from Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund and Public Citizen; Center for Law and\nSocial Policy; Domini Impact Investments; Dynamhex, Inc.; FAIRR Initiative; Generation Investment\nManagement; Hannon Armstrong; HP, Inc.; Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility; NYC Office of\nComptroller; Pre-Distribution Initiative; Regenerative Crisis Response Committee; and WK Associates.\n675 See supra note 66 (referencing The Wall Street Journal (Nov. 5, 2021)).\n267\n\nregarding them.676 The proposed disclosure requirements are intended to elicit enhanced\ninformation about climate-related targets and goals so that investors can better evaluate these\npoints.\nIf a registrant has set climate-related targets or goals, the proposed rules would require it\nto disclose them, including, as applicable, a description of:\n\u2022 The scope of activities and emissions included in the target;\n\u2022 The unit of measurement, including whether the target is absolute or intensity based;\n\u2022 The defined time horizon by which the target is intended to be achieved, and whether the\ntime horizon is consistent with one or more goals established by a climate-related treaty,\nlaw, regulation, policy, or organization;\n\u2022 The defined baseline time period and baseline emissions against which progress will be\ntracked with a consistent base year set for multiple targets;\n\u2022 Any interim targets set by the registrant; and\n\u2022 How the registrant intends to meet its climate-related targets or goals.677\nThis information would help investors understand a registrant\u2019s particular target or goal\nand a particular timeline for that target or goal, how the target or goal is to be measured, and how\nprogress against the target or goal is to be tracked. For example, a registrant might disclose that\nit plans to cut its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions by 50 percent by 2030.678 The registrant might also\ndisclose a target to reduce its Scope 3 emissions by 50 percent by 2035. In addition, the\n676 See, e.g., Jocelyn Timperley, The Guardian, The truth behind corporate climate pledges (July 26, 2021); Peter\nEavis and Clifford Krauss, The New York Times, What\u2019s Really Behind Corporate Promises on Climate\nChange? (May 12, 2021); and Alice C. Hill and Jennifer Nash, The Hill, The truth behind companies' 'net zero'\nclimate commitments (Apr. 9, 2021).\n677 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1506(b)(1) through (6).\n678 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1506(b)(3).\n268\n\nregistrant might also set a goal of achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions across its\noperations by 2050, in keeping with the goals of the Paris Agreement.\nUnder the proposed rules, the registrant would be required to disclose the baseline year\nfor multiple targets.679 Requiring disclosure of defined baseline time periods and baseline\nemissions against which progress will be tracked, with a consistent base year for multiple targets,\ncould help investors compare the progress made towards each target. The registrant would also\nbe required to disclose the unit of measurement, including whether the target is expressed in\nabsolute terms or is intensity-based. If the registrant has set intervening targets (e.g., reducing its\nScope 3 emissions by 35 percent by 2030), the registrant would be required to disclose these\ntargets.680 Each of the proposed disclosure requirements is intended to provide investors with\nadditional insight into the scope and specifics of a registrant\u2019s climate-related targets or goals.\nThe proposed rules would further require a registrant to discuss how it intends to meet its\nclimate-related targets or goals.681 This information should enable investors to better understand\nthe potential impacts on a registrant associated with pursuing its climate-related targets or goals.\nFor example, for a target or goal regarding net GHG emissions reduction, the discussion could\ninclude a strategy to increase energy efficiency, transition to lower carbon products, purchase\ncarbon offsets or RECs, or engage in carbon removal and carbon storage.682 For a registrant\noperating in a water-stressed area, with the goal of reducing its freshwater needs, the discussion\ncould include a strategy to increase the water efficiency of its operations, such as by recycling\n679 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1506(b)(4).\n680 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1506(b)(5).\n681 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1506(b)(6).\n682 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1506(b)(6).\n269\n\nwastewater or, if in agriculture, engaging in bioengineering techniques to make crops more\nresilient and less water dependent. Information about how a registrant intends to achieve its\nclimate-related target or goal could provide investors with a better understanding of the potential\ncosts to mitigate a potential climate-related risk, such as a manufacturer\u2019s reduction of GHG\nemissions through implementation of a relatively high cost solution such as carbon capture and\nstorage technology.683\nThe proposed rules would also require a registrant to disclose relevant data to indicate\nwhether it is making progress toward achieving the target or goal and how such progress has\nbeen achieved.684 A registrant would be required to update this disclosure each fiscal year by\ndescribing the actions taken during the year to achieve its targets or goals.685 This proposed\ndisclosure could help investors assess how well a registrant is managing its identified climate-\nrelated risks.\nSome companies might establish climate-related goals or targets without yet knowing\nhow they will achieve those goals. They might plan to develop their strategies over time,\nparticularly as new technologies become available that might facilitate their achievement of their\ngoals. The fact that a company has set a goal or target does not mean that it has a specific plan\nfor how it will achieve those goals. What is important is that investors be informed of a\nregistrant\u2019s plans and progress wherever it is in the process of developing and implementing its\nplan.\n683 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1502.\n684 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1506(c).\n685 See id.\n270\n\nIf the registrant has used carbon offsets or RECs in its plan to achieve climate-related\ntargets or goals, it would be required to disclose the amount of carbon reduction represented by\nthe offsets or the amount of generated renewable energy represented by the RECS, the source of\nthe offsets or RECs, a description and location of the underlying projects, any registries or other\nauthentication of the offsets or RECs, and the cost of the offsets or RECs.686 For example, a\ncarbon offset might pertain to an underlying project to reduce GHG emissions, increase the\nstorage of carbon, or enhance GHG removals from the atmosphere. Information regarding the\nsource, value, underlying projects, and authentication of the offsets or RECs could help investors\nassess the offsets or RECs and the effectiveness of the registrant\u2019s plan to achieve its climate-\nrelated targets or goals. Such information could also help investors understand changes in the\nuse or viability of the carbon offsets or RECs as part of achieving a registrant\u2019s climate-related\ntargets or goals that are caused by changes in regulation or markets. A reasonable investor could\nwell assess differently the effectiveness and value to a registrant of the use of carbon offsets\nwhere the underlying projects resulted in authenticated reductions in GHG emissions compared\nto the use of offsets where the underlying projects resulted in the avoidance, but not the\nreduction, in GHG emissions or otherwise lacked verification. As some commenters have\nindicated, mandated detailed disclosure about the nature of a purchased carbon offset could also\nhelp to mitigate instances of greenwashing.687\nProposed 17 CFR 229.1505(a)(2) (Item 1505(a)(2)) would state that a registrant may\nprovide the disclosures required by the section when discussing climate-related impacts on its\nstrategy, business model, and outlook (in response to proposed Item 1502) or when discussing its\n686 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1506(d).\n687 See, e.g., letter from Dimensional Fund Advisors.\n271\n\ntransition plan as part of its risk management disclosure (in response to proposed Item 1503). If\nso, it need not repeat the disclosure in response to the proposed targets and goals section but\nshould cross-refer to the section where the information has been provided.\nA registrant\u2019s disclosure of its climate-related targets or goals should not be construed to\nbe promises or guarantees. To the extent that information regarding a registrant\u2019s climate-related\ntargets or goals would constitute forward-looking statements, which we would expect, for\nexample, with respect to how a registrant intends to achieve its climate-related targets or goals\nand expected progress regarding those targets and goals, the PSLRA safe harbors would apply to\nsuch statements, assuming all other statutory requirements for those safe harbors are satisfied.\nRequest for Comment\n168. Should we require a registrant to disclose whether it has set any targets related to the\nreduction of GHG emissions, as proposed? Should we also require a registrant to disclose\nwhether it has set any other climate-related target or goal, e.g., regarding energy usage, water\nusage, conservation or ecosystem restoration, or revenues from low-carbon products, in line with\nanticipated regulatory requirements, market constraints, or other goals, as proposed? Are there\nany other climate-related targets or goals that we should specify and, if so, which targets or\ngoals? Is it clear when disclosure under this proposed item would be triggered, or do we need to\nprovide additional guidance? Would our proposal discourage registrants from setting such\ntargets or goals?\n169. Should we require a registrant, when disclosing its targets or goals, to disclose:\n\u2022 The scope of activities and emissions included in the target;\n\u2022 The unit of measurement, including whether the target is absolute or intensity based;\n272\n\n\u2022 The defined time horizon by which the target is intended to be achieved, and whether the\ntime horizon is consistent with one or more goals established by a climate-related treaty,\nlaw, regulation, or organization;\n\u2022 The defined baseline time period and baseline emissions against which progress will be\ntracked with a consistent base year set for multiple targets;\n\u2022 Any intervening targets set by the registrant; and\n\u2022 How it intends to meet its targets or goals, each as proposed?\nAre there any other items of information about a registrant\u2019s climate-related targets or\ngoals that we should require to be disclosed, in addition to or instead of these proposed items?\nAre there any proposed items regarding such targets or goals that we should exclude from the\nrequired disclosure? If a registrant has set multiple targets or goals, should it be permitted to\nestablish different base years for those targets or goals?\n170. Should we require a registrant to discuss how it intends to meet its climate-related\ntargets or goals, as proposed? Should we provide examples of potential items of discussion\nabout a target or goal regarding GHG emissions reduction, such as a strategy to increase energy\nefficiency, a transition to lower carbon products, purchasing carbon offsets or RECs, or engaging\nin carbon removal and carbon storage, as proposed? Should we provide additional examples of\nitems of discussion about climate-related targets or goals and, if so, what items should we add?\nShould we remove any of the proposed examples of items of discussion?\n171. Should we require a registrant, when disclosing its targets or goals, to disclose any data\nthat indicates whether the registrant is making progress towards meeting the target and how such\nprogress has been achieved, as proposed?\n273\n\n172. Should we require that the disclosure be provided in any particular format, such as\ncharts? Would certain formats help investors and others better assess these disclosures in the\ncontext of assessing the registrant\u2019s business and financial condition? What additional or other\nrequirements would help in this regard?\n173. If a registrant has used carbon offsets or RECs, should we require the registrant to\ndisclose the amount of carbon reduction represented by the offsets or the amount of generated\nrenewable energy represented by the RECS, the source of the offsets or RECs, the nature and\nlocation of the underlying projects, any registries or other authentication of the offsets or RECs,\nand the cost of the offsets or RECs, as proposed? Are there other items of information about\ncarbon offsets or RECs that we should specifically require to be disclosed when a registrant\ndescribes its targets or goals and the related use of offsets or RECs? Are there proposed items of\ninformation that we should exclude from the required disclosure about offsets and RECs?\n174. Should we apply the PSLRA statutory safe harbors as they currently exist to forward-\nlooking statements involving climate-related targets and goals, or other climate-related forward-\nlooking information? Should we instead create a separate safe harbor for forward-looking\nclimate-related information, including targets and goals? Should we adopt an exception to the\nPSLRA statutory safe harbors that would extend the safe harbors to climate-related forward-\nlooking disclosures made in an initial public offering registration statement?\n274"

    "text": "J. Registrants Subject to the Climate-Related Disclosure Rules and Affected\nForms\nThe proposed climate-related disclosure rules would apply to a registrant with Exchange\nAct reporting obligations pursuant to Exchange Act Section 13(a)688 or Section 15(d)689 and\ncompanies filing a Securities Act or Exchange Act registration statement. Specifically, we are\nproposing to require a registrant to include climate-related disclosure in Securities Act or\nExchange Act registration statements (Securities Act Forms S-1, F-1, S-3, F-3, S-4, F-4, and S-\n11, and Exchange Act Forms 10 and 20-F)690 and Exchange Act annual reports (Forms 10-K and\n20-F), including the proposed financial statement metrics.691 Similar to the treatment of other\nimportant business and financial information, the proposed rules would also require registrants to\ndisclose any material change to the climate-related disclosure provided in a registration statement\n688 15 U.S.C. 78m(a).\n689 15 U.S.C. 78o(d).\n690 Form 20-F is the Exchange Act form used by a foreign private issuer for its annual report or to register a class\nof securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. The proposed rules would amend Part I of Form 20-F to\nrequire a foreign private issuer to provide the climate-related disclosures pursuant to the proposed rules either\nwhen registering a class of securities under the Exchange Act or when filing its Exchange Act annual report. A\nforeign private issuer would also be required to comply with the proposed rules when filing a Securities Act\nregistration statement on Form F-1. Because Form F-1 requires a registrant to include the disclosures required\nby Part I of Form 20-F, the proposed amendment to Form 20-F would render unnecessary a formal amendment\nto Form F-1. We are similarly not formally amending Forms S-3 and F-3 because the climate-related disclosure\nwould be included in a registrant\u2019s Form 10-K or 20-F annual report that is incorporated by reference into those\nSecurities Act registration statements.\n691 See Form 20-F, General Instruction B(d) (stating that Regulation S-X applies to the presentation of financial\ninformation in the form). Although Item 17 and 18 of Form 20-F, and the forms that refer to Form 20-F\n(including Forms F-1 and F-3) permit a foreign private issuer to file financial statements prepared in accordance\nwith IFRS as issued by the IASB, the proposed Article 14 disclosure would nevertheless be required (similar to\ndisclosure required by Article 12 of Regulation S-X). See Acceptance from Foreign Private Issuers of\nFinancial Statements Prepared in Accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards Without\nReconciliation to U.S. GAAP, Rel. No. 33-8879 (Dec. 21, 2007) [73 FR 986 (Jan. 4, 2008)], 999, n.136 (stating\nthat \u201cRegulation S\u2013X will continue to apply to the filings of all foreign private issuers, including those who file\nfinancial statements prepared using IFRS as issued by the IASB,\u201d but providing that such issuers \u201cwill comply\nwith IASB requirements for form and content within the financial statements, rather than with the specific\npresentation and disclosure provisions in Articles 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10 of Regulation S-X\u201d).\n275\n\nor annual report in its Form 10-Q (or, in certain circumstances, Form 6-K for a registrant that is a\nforeign private issuer that does not report on domestic forms).692\nThe proposed rules would amend Form 20-F and the Securities Act forms that a foreign\nprivate issuer may use to register the offer and sale of securities under the Securities Act to\nrequire the same climate-related disclosures as proposed for a domestic registrant.693 Because\nclimate-related risks potentially impact both domestic and foreign private issuers, regardless of\nthe registrant\u2019s jurisdiction of origin or organization, requiring that foreign private issuers\nprovide this disclosure would be important to achieving our goal of more consistent, reliable, and\ncomparable information across registrants. Moreover, we note that Form 20-F imposes\nsubstantially similar disclosure requirements as those required for Form 10-K filers on matters,\nsuch as risk factors and MD&A, that are similar and relevant to the proposed climate-related\ndisclosures.694\n692 Form 6-K is the form furnished by a foreign private issuer with an Exchange Act reporting obligation if the\nissuer: (i) makes or is required to make the information public pursuant to the law of the jurisdiction of its\ndomicile or in which it is incorporated or organized, or (ii) files or is required to file the information with a\nstock exchange on which its securities are traded and which was made public by that exchange, or (iii)\ndistributes or is required to distribute the information to its security holders. See General Instruction B to Form\n6-K. That instruction currently list certain types of information that are required to be furnished pursuant to\nsubparagraphs (i), (ii), and (iii), above. While we are proposing to amend Form 6-K to add climate-related\ndisclosure to the list of the types of information to be provided on Form 6-K, a foreign private issuer would not\nbe required to provide the climate-related disclosure if such disclosure is not required to be furnished pursuant\nto subparagraphs (i), (ii), or (iii) of General Instruction B.\n693 See proposed Item 3.E to Form 20-F.\n694 For similar reasons, we believe that requiring the proposed climate disclosures on Forms F-1, F-3, and F-4 is\nappropriate because those forms either require the disclosure pursuant to certain parts of Form 20-F (Forms F-1\nand F-4) and certain items, such as risk factors, under Regulation S-K, or permit the incorporation by reference\nof Form 20-F (Forms F-3 and F-4) and therefore require disclosure similar to the domestic forms.\n276\n\nWe are not proposing generally to exempt SRCs, EGCs,695 or registrants that are foreign\nprivate issuers from the entire scope of the proposed climate-related disclosure rules because we\nagree with commenters who stated that, because of their broad impact across industries and\njurisdictions, climate-related risks may pose a significant risk to the operations and financial\ncondition of domestic and foreign issuers, both large and small.696 While we are not proposing\nto exempt SRCs from the full scope of the proposed climate-related disclosure rules, we are\nproposing to exempt SRCs from the proposed Scope 3 emissions disclosure requirement.697 We\nalso are proposing to provide a longer transition period for SRCs to comply with the proposed\nrules than we are proposing for other registrants.698 The proposed accommodations for Scope 3\nemissions disclosures could mitigate the proposed rules\u2019 compliance burden for smaller\nregistrants that, when compared to larger registrants with more resources, may be less able to\nafford the fixed costs associated with the reporting of GHG emissions. In addition, the extended\ncompliance period would give SRCs additional time to allocate the resources necessary to\ncompile and prepare their climate-related disclosures.\n695 An emerging growth company (\u201cEGC\u201d) is a registrant that had total annual gross revenues of less than $1.07\nbillion during its most recently completed fiscal year and has not met the specified conditions for no longer\nbeing considered an EGC. See 17 CFR 230.405; 17 CFR 240.12b-2; 15 U.S.C. 77b(a)(19); 15 U.S.C.\n78c(a)(80); and Inflation Adjustments and Other Technical Amendments under Titles I and II of the JOBS Act,\nRelease No. 33- 10332 (Mar. 31, 2017) [82 FR 17545 (Apr. 12, 2017)].\n696 See, e.g., letters from Rob Bonta, California Attorney General et al.; Ceres et al.; and Natural Resources\nDefense Council.\n697 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(c)(3). In this regard we note that participants in the Commission-hosted 2021\nSmall Business Forum recommended that the Commission provide exemptions or scaled requirements for small\nand medium-sized companies in connection with any new ESG disclosure requirements adopted by the\nCommission. See Report on the 40th Annual Small Business Forum (May 2021), available at\nhttps://www.sec.gov/files/2021_OASB_Annual_Forum_Report_FINAL_508.pdf. See also Office of the\nAdvocate for Small Business Capital Formation, Annual Report for Fiscal Year 2021 (supporting \u201cefforts to\ncontinue tailoring the disclosure and reporting framework to the complexity and size of operations of\ncompanies, either by scaling obligations or delaying compliance for the smallest of the public companies,\nparticularly as it pertains to potential new or expanded disclosure requirements\u201d).\n698 See infra Section II.M.\n277\n\nRequest for Comment\n175. Should the proposed climate-related disclosures be required in Exchange Act reports\nand registration statements, as proposed? Should we exempt SRCs from all of the proposed\nclimate-related disclosure rules instead of exempting them solely from Scope 3 emissions\ndisclosure requirements, as proposed? Should we exempt SRCs from certain other proposed\nclimate-related disclosure requirements and, if so, which requirements? For example, in addition\nto the proposed exemption from Scope 3 emissions disclosure, should we exempt SRCs from the\nproposed requirement to disclose Scopes 1 and 2 emissions? Are there certain types of other\nregistrants, such as EGCs or business development companies (\u201cBDCs\u201d),699 that should be\nexcluded from all or some of the proposed climate-related disclosure rules?\n176. Should we require foreign private issuers that report on Form 20-F to provide the same\nclimate-related disclosures as Form 10-K filers, as proposed? Should we require climate-related\ndisclosures in the registration statements available for foreign private issuers, as proposed? If\nnot, how should the climate-related disclosures provided by foreign private issuer registrants\ndiffer from the disclosures provided by domestic registrants?\n177. Should we require a registrant to disclose any material changes to the climate-related\ndisclosure provided in its registration statement or annual report in its Form 10-Q or Form 6-K,\nas proposed? Are there any changes that should be required to be reported on Form 8-K?\n178. Should we require the climate-related disclosure in the forms specified above? Is the\napplication of the proposed rules to the forms sufficiently clear, or should we include additional\n699 A BDC is a closed-end investment company that has a class of its equity securities registered under, or has filed\na registration statement pursuant to, Section 12 of the Exchange Act, and elects to be regulated as a business\ndevelopment company. See Section 54 of the Investment Company Act, 15 U.S.C. 80a-53. Like other Section\n12 registrants, BDCs are required to file Exchange Act annual reports.\n278\n\nclarifying amendments? For example, would the application of proposed Article 14 to Forms\n20-F, F-1 and F-3 be sufficiently clear when a registrant prepares its financial statements\npursuant to IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (\u201cIASB\u201d) without\nreconciliation to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d), or should we\nadd a related instruction to those forms?\n179. Are there certain registration statements or annual reports that should be excluded from\nthe scope of the proposed climate-related disclosure rules? For example, should we exclude\nSecurities Act registration statements filed in connection with a registrant\u2019s initial public\noffering? Would such an accommodation help address concerns about the burdens of\ntransitioning to public company status? We have not proposed to require climate-related\ndisclosures in registration statements on Form S-8 or annual reports on Form 11-K. Should we\nrequire such disclosures?\n180. Should we require climate-related disclosure in Forms S-4 and F-4, as proposed?\nShould we provide transitional relief for recently acquired companies? For example, should we\nprovide that a registrant would not be required to provide the proposed climate-related\ndisclosures for a company that is a target of a proposed acquisition under Form S-4 or F-4 until\nthe fiscal year following the year of the acquisition if the target company is not an Exchange Act\nreporting company and is not the subject of foreign climate-related disclosure requirements that\nare substantially similar to the Commission\u2019s proposed requirements? Should such transitional\nrelief in this instance be for a longer period than one year and, if so, for how long should such\ntransitional relief extend?\n181. We have not proposed to amend Form 40-F, the Exchange Act form used by a\nCanadian issuer eligible to report under the Multijurisdictional Disclosure System (\u201cMJDS\u201d) to\n279\n\nregister securities or to file its annual report under the Exchange Act, to include the proposed\nclimate-related disclosure requirements. Should we require a Form 40-F issuer to comply with\nthe Commission\u2019s proposed climate-related disclosure requirements? Should we permit a MJDS\nissuer to comply with Canadian climate-related disclosure requirements instead of the proposed\nrules if they meet certain conditions or provide certain additional disclosures and, if so, which\nconditions or disclosures?\n182. The proposed rules would not apply to asset-backed issuers. The Commission and staff\nare continuing to evaluate climate-related disclosures with respect to asset-backed securities.\nShould we require asset-backed issuers to provide some or all of the disclosures under proposed\nSubpart 1500 of Regulation S-K? If so, which of the proposed disclosures should apply to asset-\nbacked issuers? Are other types of climate disclosure better suited to asset-backed issuers? How\ncan climate disclosure best be tailored to various asset classes?\n183. Should we adopt an alternative reporting provision that would permit a registrant that is\na foreign private issuer and subject to the climate-related disclosure requirements of an\nalternative reporting regime that has been deemed by the Commission to be substantially similar\nto the requirements of proposed Subpart 1500 of Regulation S-K and Article 14 of Regulation S-\nX to satisfy its disclosure obligations under those provisions by complying with the reporting\nrequirements of the alternative reporting regime (\u201calternative reporting provision\u201d)? If so,\nshould we require the submission of an application for recognition of an alternative reporting\nregime as having substantially similar requirements for purposes of alternative reporting\nregarding climate-related disclosures? Should we permit companies, governments, industry\ngroups, or climate-related associations to file such an application? Should we require the\napplicant to follow certain procedures, such as those set forth in 17 CFR 240.0-13?\n280\n\n184. If we adopt an alternative reporting provision, should we specify certain minimum\nstandards that the alternative reporting regime must meet in order to be recognized and, if so,\nwhat standards? For example, should we specify that an alternative reporting regime must\nrequire the disclosure of a foreign private issuer\u2019s Scopes 1 and 2 emissions and related targets,\nthe proposed financial statement metrics, as well as disclosures pursuant to the TCFD\u2019s\nrecommendations regarding governance, strategy, and risk management disclosure? Should we\nspecify that the alternative reporting regime must require the disclosure of Scope 3 emissions\nand, if so, should we deem the alternative reporting regime to be substantially similar even if its\nScope 3 emissions requirements become effective after the Commission\u2019s phase in period for\nScope 3 emissions disclosure requirements? Should we specify that the alternative reporting\nregime must require the disclosure of scenario analysis if a registrant uses scenario analysis in\nformulating its strategy regarding climate-related risks? Are there certain climate-related\ndisclosure requirements that have been adopted or are in the process of being adopted in other\njurisdictions that we should consider to be substantially similar to the Commission\u2019s rules for\npurposes of an alternative reporting provision? If so, which requirements should we consider?\n185. If we adopt an alternative reporting provision, should it be a mutual recognition system,\nso that, as a condition of our recognition of a particular jurisdiction as an alternative reporting\nregime, that jurisdiction must recognize the Commission\u2019s climate-related disclosure rules as an\nalternative reporting system that a registrant dual-listed in the United States and the other\njurisdiction may use to fulfill the foreign jurisdiction\u2019s climate-related disclosure rules?\n186. If we adopt an alternative reporting provision, should we require a registrant filing the\nalternative climate-related disclosure to make certain changes that we deem necessary as a\ncondition to alternative reporting? For example, should we require a registrant to comply with\n281\n\nXBRL tagging requirements as a condition to filing alternative climate-related disclosure? Are\nthere other specific conditions that we should impose on disclosure under an alternative climate\nreporting provision?\n187. If we adopt an alternative reporting provision, should we require a registrant using that\nsystem to:\n\u2022 State in the filing that it is relying on this alternative reporting provision;\n\u2022 Identify the alternative reporting regime for which the climate-related disclosure was\nprepared;\n\u2022 Identify the exhibit number of the filing where the alternative disclosure can be found;\nand\n\u2022 File a fair and accurate English translation of the alternative climate-related disclosure if\nin a foreign language?\nWould these requirements enhance the accessibility of the alternative disclosures? Are there\nother requirements that we should impose to enhance the transparency of the alternative climate-\nrelated disclosure?\n188. If we adopt an alternative reporting provision, should we permit a registrant to follow\nthe submission deadline of the approved alternative reporting regime even if that deadline differs\nfrom the deadline for reporting under our rules? If so, what conditions, if any, should apply to\npermit the use of such alternative deadline? For example, should the registrant be required to\nprovide adequate notice, before the due date of the Commission filing in which the alternative\ndisclosure is required to be included? Should such notice indicate the registrant\u2019s intent to file\nthe alternative disclosure using the alternative jurisdiction\u2019s deadline? If so, what would\nconstitute adequate notice? For example, should the deadline for filing the notice be three, five,\n282"

Should we permit a registrant to\nprovide such notice through an appropriate submission to the Commission\u2019s EDGAR system?\nShould we permit a registrant to indicate in its Form 20-F or other report that it will file the\nalternative disclosure at a later date if permitted to do so by the alternative reporting regime? In\nthat case, should we permit the registrant to file the alternative disclosure on a Form 6-K or 8-K?\nShould we instead require a registrant to submit the notice via a form that we would create for\nsuch purpose? Should there be any consequences if a registrant fails to file a timely notice or\nfails to file the alternative disclosure by the alternative regime\u2019s due date? For example, should\nwe preclude such a registrant from relying on the alternative reporting provision for the\nfollowing fiscal year?\n189. An International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) has recently been created,\nwhich is expected to issue global sustainability standards, including climate-related disclosure\nstandards.700 If we adopt an alternative reporting provision, should that provision be structured\nto encompass reports made pursuant to criteria developed by a global sustainability standards\nbody, such as the ISSB? If so, should such alternative reporting be limited to foreign private\nissuers, or should we extend this option to all registrants? What conditions, if any, should we\nplace on a registrant\u2019s use of alternative reporting provisions based on the ISSB or a similar\nbody?\nK. Structured Data Requirement\nThe proposed rules would require a registrant to tag the proposed climate-related\ndisclosures in a structured, machine-readable data language.701 Specifically, the proposed rules\n700 See supra note 92.\n701 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1507.\n283\n\nwould require a registrant to tag climate-related disclosures in Inline eXtensible Business\nReporting Language (\u201cInline XBRL\u201d) in accordance with 17 CFR 232.405 (Rule 405 of\nRegulation S-T) and the EDGAR Filer Manual. The proposed requirements would include block\ntext tagging and detail tagging of narrative and quantitative disclosures provided pursuant to\nSubpart 1500 of Regulation S-K and Article 14 of Regulation S-X.702\nIn 2009, the Commission adopted rules requiring operating companies to submit the\ninformation from the financial statements (including footnotes and schedules thereto) included in\ncertain registration statements and periodic and current reports in a structured, machine-readable\ndata language using eXtensible Business Reporting Language (\u201cXBRL\u201d).703 In 2018, the\nCommission adopted modifications to these requirements by requiring issuers to use Inline\nXBRL, which is both machine-readable and human-readable, to reduce the time and effort\nassociated with preparing XBRL filings and improve the quality and usability of XBRL data for\n702 For the proposed Subpart 1500 disclosures, this tagging requirement would be implemented by including a\ncross-reference to Rule 405 of Regulation S-T in proposed Item 1507 of Regulation S-K, and by revising Rule\n405(b) of Regulation S-T to include the proposed climate-related disclosures required by Subpart 1500 of\nRegulation S-K. The proposed Article 14 of Regulation S-X disclosures would be subject to existing\nrequirements in Rule 405(b) to tag information in financial statements (including footnotes). Pursuant to Rule\n301 of Regulation S-T the EDGAR Filer Manual is incorporated by reference into the Commission\u2019s rules. In\nconjunction with the EDGAR Filer Manual, Regulation S-T governs the electronic submission of documents\nfiled with the Commission. Rule 405 of Regulation S-T specifically governs the scope and manner of\ndisclosure tagging requirements for operating companies and investment companies, including the requirement\nin Rule 405(a)(3) to use Inline XBRL as the specific structured data language to use for tagging the disclosures.\n703 Interactive Data to Improve Financial Reporting, Release No. 33-9002 (Jan. 30, 2009) [74 FR 6776 (Feb. 10,\n2009)] (\u201c2009 Financial Statement Information Adopting Release\u201d) (requiring submission of an Interactive\nData File to the Commission in exhibits to such reports); see also Release No. 33-9002A (Apr. 1, 2009) [74 FR\n15666 (Apr. 7, 2009)].\n284\n\ninvestors.704 In 2020, the Commission adopted Inline XBRL requirements for business\ndevelopment companies that will be effective no later than February 2023.705\nRequiring Inline XBRL tagging of the proposed climate-related disclosures would benefit\ninvestors by making the disclosures more readily available and easily accessible to investors,\nmarket participants, and other users for aggregation, comparison, filtering, and other analysis, as\ncompared to requiring a non-machine readable data language such as ASCII or HTML. This\nwould enable automated extraction and analysis of climate-related disclosures, allowing\ninvestors and other market participants to more efficiently perform large-scale analysis and\ncomparison of climate-related disclosures across companies and time periods. At the same time,\nwe do not expect the incremental compliance burden associated with tagging the additional\ninformation to be unduly burdensome, because issuers subject to the proposed requirements are\nor in the near future will be subject to similar Inline XBRL requirements in other Commission\nfilings.706\nRequest for Comment\n190. Should we require registrants to tag the climate-related disclosures, including block text\ntagging and detail tagging of narrative and quantitative disclosures required by Subpart 1500 of\nRegulation S-K and Article 14 of Regulation S-X in Inline XBRL, as proposed? Should we\npermit custom tags for the climate-related disclosures?\n704 Inline XBRL Filing of Tagged Data, Release No. 33-10514 (June 28, 2018) [83 FR 40846, 40847 (Aug. 16,\n2018)]. Inline XBRL allows filers to embed XBRL data directly into an HTML document, eliminating the need\nto tag a copy of the information in a separate XBRL exhibit.

Should we require issuers to use a different structured data language to tag climate-\nrelated disclosures? If so, what structured data language should we require?

Treatment for Purposes of Securities Act and Exchange Act\nWe are proposing to treat the proposed required climate-related disclosures as \u201cfiled\u201d and\ntherefore subject to potential liability under Exchange Act Section 18,707 except for disclosures\nfurnished on Form 6-K. The proposed filed climate-related disclosures would also be subject to\npotential Section 11 liability708 if included in or incorporated by reference into a Securities Act\nregistration statement. This treatment would apply both to the disclosures in response to\nproposed subpart 1500 of Regulation S-K and to proposed Article 14 of Regulation S-X.\nForm 6-K disclosures would not be treated as \u201cfiled\u201d because the form, by its own terms,\nstates that \u201cinformation and documents furnished in this report shall not be deemed to be \u201cfiled\u201d\nfor the purposes of Section 18 of the Act or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section.\u201d709\nThe treatment of disclosures on Form 6-K as furnished is a long-standing part of our foreign\nprivate issuer disclosure system.710\n707 15 U.S.C. 78r.\n708 15 U.S.C. 77k.\n709 Form 6-K, General Instruction B.\n710 See Release No. 34-8069 (Apr. 28, 1967), [32 FR 7853 (May 30, 1967)]. Form 6-K\u2019s treatment as furnished for\npurposes of Section 18 has existed since the Commission adopted the form.\n286\n\nCommenters expressed differing views on whether we should treat Commission-\nmandated climate-related disclosures as filed or furnished. Many commenters recommended that\nwe treat such climate-related disclosures as filed.711 Some of these commenters stated that we\nshould treat climate-related disclosures like financial disclosures and require them to be filed\ntogether with the rest of the Commission filing.712 Other commenters indicated that the\ntreatment of climate-related disclosures as filed would help ensure that investors have confidence\nin the accuracy and completeness of such disclosures because of the liability associated with\nfiled documents.713\nOther commenters recommended that we treat climate-related disclosures as furnished.714\nSome of these commenters stated that the Commission\u2019s treatment of such disclosures as filed\ncould act as a disincentive to providing \u201cbroader\u201d disclosure and would incentivize some issuers\n\u201cto disclose in the manner most limited to meet the specific requirement and avoid more robust\nexplanation.\u201d715 Other commenters stated that the treatment of climate-related disclosures as\n711 See, e.g., letters from Baillie Gifford; Rob Bonta, California Attorney General et al.; Calvert Research and\nManagement; Carolyn Kohoot; Center for American Progress; Ceres et al.; Certified B Corporations; Clean\nYield Asset Management; Climate Risk Disclosure Lab; Consumer Federation of America; Environmental\nBankers Association; Friends of the Earth, Amazon Watch, and Rainforest Action Network; Garcia Hamilton &\nAssociates (June 11, 2021); Grant Thornton; Sarah Ladin; Miller/Howard Investments; Natural Resources\nDefense Council; New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants; Nia Impact Capital; Teachers\nInsurance and Annuity Association of America; ValueEdge Advisors (July 5, 2021); and Vert Asset\nManagement.\n712 See, e.g., letters from Rob Bonta, California Attorney General et al.; Calvert Research and Management; and\nCeres et al.\n713 See, e.g., letters from Consumer Federation of America; and Natural Resources Defense Council.\n714 See, e.g., letters from American Petroleum Institute; Associated General Contractors of America; Bank Policy\nInstitute; Business Roundtable; Chamber of Commerce; Chevron; Cisco; ConocoPhilips; Dell Technologies;\nDow; FedEx Corporation (June 11, 2021); Investment Company Institute; NACCO Industries, Inc.

While we acknowledge commenters who stated that\nthe methodology underlying climate data continues to evolve,718 we intend to provide registrants\nwith an ample transition period to prepare to provide such disclosure.719 Further, much of the\ndisclosure proposed to be required reflects discussion of a company\u2019s own climate risk\nassessment and strategy, which is not dependent on external sources of information. In addition,\nwe have provided guidance and proposed rules on the applicability of safe harbors to certain\ndisclosures under the proposed rules. For these reasons, we believe it would be appropriate for\nthe proposed disclosures to be filed rather than furnished, except with respect to the proposed\ndisclosure we are requiring on Form 6-K.\nRequest for Comment\n194.

Should we treat the climate disclosures on Form 6-K as filed?\nM. Compliance Date\nWe recognize that many registrants may require time to establish the necessary systems,\ncontrols, and procedures to comply with the proposed climate-related disclosure requirements.\nIn addition, some commenters recommended that the Commission not adopt a \u201cone size fits all\u201d\napproach when promulgating climate-related disclosure rules because such an approach would\ndisproportionately impact smaller registrants.720 In order to provide registrants, especially\nsmaller registrants, with additional time to prepare for the proposed climate-related disclosures,\nwe are proposing phased-in dates for complying with proposed subpart 1500 of Regulation S-K\nand Article 14 of Regulation S-X, which would provide additional time for certain smaller\n720 See supra note 556.\n289\n\nregistrants. The table below summarizes the proposed phase-ins for the compliance date. The\ntable assumes, for illustrative purposes, that the proposed rules will be adopted with an effective\ndate in December 2022, and that the registrant has a December 31st fiscal year-end.\nRegistrant Type Disclosure Financial Statement\nCompliance Date Metrics Audit\nCompliance Date\nAll proposed disclosures, including GHG emissions metrics:\nGHG emissions metrics: Scope 1, Scope 3 and associated\nScope 2, and associated intensity intensity metric\nmetric, but excluding Scope 3.\nLarge Fiscal year 2023 Fiscal year 2024\nAccelerated Filer (filed in 2024) (filed in 2025)\nAccelerated Filer Fiscal year 2024 Fiscal year 2025 Same as\nand Non- (filed in 2025) (filed in 2026) disclosure\nAccelerated Filer compliance date\nSRC Fiscal year 2025 Exempted\n(filed in 2026)\nThe proposed compliance dates in the table above would apply to both annual reports and\nregistration statements. For example, if a non-accelerated filer with a December 31st fiscal year-\nend filed a registration statement that was not required to include audited financial statements for\nfiscal year 2024 (e.g., the registration statement was filed in 2023 or 2024), it would not be\nrequired to comply with the proposed climate disclosure rules in that registration statement.\nA registrant with a different fiscal year-end date that results in its fiscal year 2023\ncommencing before the effective date of the rules would not be required to comply with subpart\n1500 of Regulation S-K and Article 14 of Regulation S-X until the following fiscal year. For\nexample, a large accelerated filer with a March 31st fiscal year-end date would not be required to\ncomply with the proposed climate disclosure rules until its Form 10-K for fiscal year 2024, filed\nin June, 2024. This would provide large accelerated filers, who would have the earliest\ncompliance date of all categories of filers, with what we believe is a reasonable amount of time\nto comply with the rules.\n290\n\nWe believe that initially applying the disclosure requirements to the more limited pool of\nlarge accelerated filers would be appropriate, because many large accelerated filers are already\ncollecting and disclosing climate-related information, have already devoted resources to these\nefforts, and have some levels of controls and processes in place for such disclosure.721 In\ncomparison, registrants that are not large accelerated filers may need more time to develop the\nsystems, controls, and processes necessary to comply with the proposed rules, and may face\nproportionately higher costs. Accordingly, we propose to provide them additional time to\ncomply.\nWe also recognize that obtaining the data necessary to calculate a registrant\u2019s Scope 3\nemissions might prove challenging since much of the data is likely to be under the control of\nthird parties. In order to provide sufficient time for registrants to make the necessary\narrangements to begin gathering and assessing such data, we are proposing an additional one-\nyear phase-in period for the Scope 3 emissions disclosure requirements. As previously\nmentioned, we also are proposing an exemption for SRCs from the proposed Scope 3 emissions\ndisclosure provision.722\nThe proposed mandatory compliance periods are intended to provide registrants with\nample time to prepare to provide the proposed disclosures. Registrants would, however, be able\nto provide the disclosures at any time after the effective date of the rules.\nRequest for Comment\n197.

The primary\nbenefit is that investors would have access to more consistent, comparable, and reliable\ndisclosures with respect to registrants\u2019 climate-related risks, which is expected to enable\ninvestors to make more informed investment or voting decisions. 724 By providing access to this\ninformation through SEC filings for all public issuers, this enhanced disclosure could mitigate\nthe challenges that investors currently confront in assessing the nature and extent of the climate-\nrelated risks faced by registrants and their impact on registrants\u2019 business operations and\nfinancial condition. In this way, the proposed rules may reduce information asymmetry both\namong investors, which can reduce adverse selection problems and improve stock liquidity,725\n723 Section 2(b) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. 77b (b), and Section 3(f) of the Exchange Act, 17 U.S.C. 78c(f),\nrequire the Commission, when engaging in rulemaking where it is required to consider or determine whether an\naction is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, to consider, in addition to the protection of investors,\nwhether the action will promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation. Further, Section 23(a)(2) of the\nExchange Act, 17 U.S.C. 78w(a)(2), requires the Commission, when making rules under the Exchange Act, to\nconsider the impact that the rules would have on competition, and prohibits the Commission from adopting any\nrule that would impose a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the Exchange\nAct.\n724 See infra Section IV.C.1.\n725 Id.\n293"

Affected Parties\nThe proposed disclosure requirements would apply to Forms S-1, F-1, S-3, F-3, S-4, F-4,\nS-11, 6-K, 10, 10-Q, 10-K, and 20-F. Thus, the parties that are likely affected by the proposed\nrules include registrants subject to the disclosure requirements imposed by these forms, as well\nas investors and other market participants that use the information in these filings (e.g. financial\nanalysts, investment advisors, asset managers, etc.).\nThe proposed rules may affect both domestic registrants and foreign private issuers\n(FPIs).729 We estimate that during calendar year 2020, excluding registered investment\ncompanies, there were approximately 6,220 registrants that filed on domestic forms730 and\napproximately 740 FPIs that filed on Forms 20-F. Among the registrants that filed on domestic\nforms, approximately 31 percent were large accelerated filers, 11 percent were accelerated filers,\nand 58 percent were non-accelerated filers. In addition, we estimate that approximately 50\npercent of these domestic registrants were smaller reporting companies (SRCs) and 22 percent\nwere emerging growth companies (EGCs).\n729 FPIs refer to the subset of all FPIs that file annual reports on Form 20-F, excluding MJDS filers using form 40-\nF.The number of domestic registrants and FPIs affected by the final amendments is estimated as the number of\nunique companies, identified by Central Index Key (CIK), that filed a Form 10-K, Form 20-F, or an amendment\nthereto, or both a Form 10-Q and a Form S-1, S-3, S-4, or S-11 with the Commission during calendar year\n2020, excluding asset-backed securities issuers. For purposes of this economic analysis, these estimates do not\ninclude registrants that only filed a Securities Act registration statement during calendar year 2020, or only filed\na Form 10-Q not preceded by a Securities Act registration statement (in order to avoid including entities such as\ncertain co-issuers of debt securities). We believe that most registrants that have filed a Securities Act\nregistration statement or a Form 10-Q not preceded by a Securities Act registration statement, other than such\nco-issuers, would be captured by this estimate. The estimates for the percentages of SRCs, EGCs, accelerated\nfilers, large accelerated filers, and non-accelerated filers are based on data obtained by Commission staff using a\ncomputer program that analyzes SEC filings, with supplemental data from Ives Group Audit Analytics and\nmanual review of filings by staff.\n730 This number includes approximately 20 FPIs that filed on domestic forms in 2020 and approximately 90 BDCs.\n295"

    "text": "2. Current Regulatory Framework\nA number of the Commission\u2019s existing disclosure requirements may elicit disclosure\nabout climate-related risks; however, many of these requirements are principles-based in nature\nand thus the nature and extent of the information provided depends to an extent on the judgment\nof management. As discussed above, in 2010, the Commission published interpretive guidance\non existing disclosure requirements as they pertain to business or legal developments related to\nclimate change.731 The 2010 Guidance emphasized that if climate-related factors have a material\nimpact on a firm\u2019s financial condition, disclosure may be required under current Item 101\n(Description of Business), Item 103 (Legal Proceedings), Item 105 (Risk Factors), or Item 303\n(MD&A) of Regulation S-K. While these provisions may elicit some useful climate-related\ndisclosure, these provisions have not resulted in the consistent and comparable information about\nclimate-related risks that many investors have stated that they need in order to make informed\ninvestment or voting decisions.732\n3. Existing State and Federal Laws\nThere are also state and other Federal laws that require certain climate-related disclosures\nor reporting. For instance, there are requirements for mandatory climate risk disclosure within\nthe insurance industry. As of 2021, 14 states733 and the District of Columbia require any\n731 See Commission Guidance Regarding Disclosure Related to Climate Change, Release No. 33-9106 (Feb. 2,\n2010) [75 FR 6290 (Feb, 8, 2010)] (\u201c2010 Climate Change Guidance\u201d), available at\nhttps://www.sec.gov/rules/interp/2010/33-9106.pdf (The guidance did not create new legal requirements nor\nmodify existing ones. Instead, it highlighted climate-related topics that registrants should consider in seeking to\nmeet their existing disclosure obligations (e.g. the impact of legislation, regulation, international accords,\nindirect consequences, physical risks, etc.) and in what section they should be discussed (e.g. risk factors,\nMD&A, etc.)). See also discussion in Section I.A.\n732 See Section I.B.\n733 The 14 states are California, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New\nMexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington.\n296\n\ndomestic insurers that write more than $100 million in annual net written premium734 to disclose\ntheir climate-related risk assessment and strategy via the NAIC Climate Risk Disclosure\nSurvey.735 Survey question topics include climate risk governance, climate risk management,\nmodeling and analytics, stakeholder engagement, and greenhouse gas management. In fiscal year\n2020, there were 66 publicly traded insurance companies that may be required to provide\ndisclosure pursuant to these state law provisions and that also would be subject to the proposed\nrules.\nThere also exist Federal- and state-level reporting requirements related to greenhouse gas\n(GHG) emissions. Federal GHG reporting requirements consist of the U.S. Environmental\nProtection Agency\u2019s (EPA) 2009 Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule.736 This rule\nrequires large direct emitters and suppliers of fossil fuels to report their emissions to the EPA.737\nSpecifically, the rule requires each facility that directly emits more than 25,000 metric tons of\nCO e per year to report these direct emissions. Additionally, facilities that supply certain\n2\nproducts that would result in over 25,000 metric tons of CO e if those products were released,\n2\n734 Net written premium is defined as the premiums written by an insurance company, minus premiums paid to\nreinsurance companies, plus any reinsurance assumed.\n735 See NAIC, Assessments of and Insights from NAIC Climate Risk Disclosure Data (Nov. 2020), available at\nhttps://content.naic.org/article/news_release_naic_assesses_provides_insight_insurer_climate_risk_disclosure_s\nurvey_data.htm.\n736 See 40 CFR Part 98 (2022); see also EPA, EPA Fact Sheet: Greenhouse Gases Reporting Program\nImplementation (2013), available at https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2014-09/documents/ghgrp-\noverview-factsheet.pdf.\n737 According to the EPA, \"direct emitters\" are facilities that combust fuels or otherwise put GHGs into the\natmosphere directly from their facility. An example of this is a power plant that burns coal or natural gas and\nemits carbon dioxide directly into the atmosphere. The EPA estimates that the GHGRP data reported by direct\nemitters covers about half of total U.S. emissions. \"Suppliers\" are those entities that supply products into the\neconomy which if combusted, released or oxidized emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These fuels and\nindustrial gases are not emitted from the supplier facility but instead distributed throughout the country and\nused. An example of this is gasoline, which is sold in the U.S. and primarily burned in cars throughout the\ncountry. The majority of GHG emissions associated with the transportation, residential and commercial sectors\nare accounted for by these suppliers.\n297\n\ncombusted, or oxidized must similarly report these \u201csupplied\u201d emissions.738 The resulting\nemissions data are then made public through their website.\nDue to the nature of the EPA\u2019s reporting requirements, their emissions data does not\nallow a clean disaggregation across the different scopes of emissions for a given registrant. The\nEPA requires reporting of facility-level direct emissions, which can contribute to a registrant\u2019s\nScope 1 emissions (but can typically be considered a subset, to the extent that the registrant has\nother non-reporting facilities), and facility-level supplied emissions, which can contribute to a\nregistrant\u2019s Scope 3 emissions (but can also be very different from it).739 Gases required to be\nreported by the EPA include all those referenced by the GHG Protocol and included within the\nproposed definition of \u201cgreenhouse gases.\u201d740 The EPA estimates that the required reporting\nunder their rule covers 85-90% of all GHG emissions from over 8,000 facilities in the United\nStates.741\nIn addition, at least 17 states have specific GHG emissions reporting requirements.742\nStates\u2019 rules vary with respect to reporting thresholds and emissions calculation methodologies,\n738 The EPA\u2019s emissions data does not include emissions from agriculture, land use, or direct emissions from\nsources that have annual emissions of less than 25,000 metric tons of CO2e.\n739 On this latest point, in particular, facility-level supplied emissions cannot necessarily be characterized as a\nportion of the registrant\u2019s Scope 3 emission as the boundaries of the entity required to report under the EPA\nreporting regime (the facility) are different from the boundaries of the entity required to report under our\nproposed rules (the registrant).\n740 The EPA requires emissions reporting only for domestic facilities, while the proposed rule would not be limited\nto U.S. facilities and includes indirect emissions. The EPA also requires some gases (e.g. fluorinated ethers,\nperfluoropolyether) that are considered optional under the GHG Protocol and that are not included within the\nproposed definition of \u201cgreenhouse gases.\u201d\n741 See supra note736.\n742 See NCSL, Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Targets and Market-Based Policies (2021), available at\nhttps://www.ncsl.org/research/energy/greenhouse-gas-emissions-reduction-targets-and-market-based-\npolicies.aspx. The 17 states with GHG reporting requirements are Hawaii, Washington, Oregon, California,\nNevada, Colorado, Minnesota, Iowa, Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Connecticut,\nMassachusetts, Vermont, and Maine.\n298"

    "text": "but most tend to focus on direct emissions (i.e., Scope 1), with certain exceptions. For example,\nNew York requires the reporting of direct emissions from any owner or operator of a facility that\ndirectly emits or has the potential to emit 100 tons per year or more of GHGs, and 100,000 tons\nper year or more of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO e).743 Colorado excludes oil and gas that is\n2\nexported out of state, but includes both imported and exported electricity when calculating the\nstate\u2019s emissions inventory.744 California requires annual reporting of GHG emissions by\nindustrial sources that emit more than 10,000 metric tons of CO e, transportation and natural gas\n2\nfuel suppliers, and electricity importers.745 As a result of these federal and state-level emissions\nreporting requirements, some registrants affected by the proposed rules may already have in\nplace certain processes and systems to measure and disclose their emissions.\n4. International Disclosure Requirements\nIssuers with operations abroad may also be subject to those jurisdictions\u2019 disclosure\nrequirements. Many jurisdictions\u2019 current and/or proposed requirements are based on the\nTCFD\u2019s framework for climate-related financial reporting.746 In 2015, the Financial Stability\nBoard (FSB) established the TCFD, an industry-led task force charged with developing a\nframework for assessing and disclosing climate-related financial risk. In 2017, the TCFD\npublished disclosure recommendations that provide a framework to evaluate climate-related risks\n743 See Air Compliance and Emissions (ACE) Reporting, available at\nhttps://www.dec.ny.gov/chemical/54266.html.\n744 See M. Sakas, Colorado Greenhouse Gas Producers Are Now Required To Report Emissions Data To The\nState, Colorado Public Radio News (2020), available at https://www.cpr.org/2020/05/22/colorado-greenhouse-\ngas-producers-are-now-required-to-report-emissions-data-to-the-state.\n745 See Cal. Air Res. Bd., Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting 2020 Emissions Year Frequently Asked Questions\n(Nov. 4, 2021), available at https://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/reporting/ghg-rep/reported-\ndata/2020mrrfaqs.pdf?_ga=2.110314373.182173320.1638196601-1516874544.1627053872.\n746 See Section I.D.\n299\n\nand opportunities through an assessment of their projected short-, medium-, and long-term\nfinancial impact on an issuer. The framework establishes eleven disclosure topics related to four\npillars that reflect how companies operate: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics\nand targets.747 The TCFD forms the framework for the recently published climate prototype\nstandard that the IFRS Foundation is considering as a potential model for standards by the IFRS\nFoundation\u2019s International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). As of September 2021, the\nTCFD reported that eight jurisdictions have implemented formal TCFD-aligned disclosure\nrequirements for domestic issuers: Brazil, the European Union, Hong Kong, Japan, New\nZealand, Singapore, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.748 In these jurisdictions, disclosures\nare already being provided by in-scope issuers or are expected to start between 2022 and 2025.\nPlans to expand the scope of current requirements have also been announced in several countries,\n747 See TCFD, Overview (Mar. 2021) (\u201cTCFD_Booklet_FNL_Digital_March-2020\u201d), available at\nhttps://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/60/2020/10/TCFD_Booklet_FNL_Digital_March-2020.pdf.\n748 See TCFD, 2021 Status Report (Oct. 2021), available at\nhttps://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/60/2021/07/2021-TCFD-Status_Report.pdf.\n300\n\nincluding the United Kingdom,749 the European Union,750 and Japan.751 In addition, several other\njurisdictions have proposed TCFD-aligned disclosure requirements, issued policies or guidance\nin line with the TCFD recommendations, or otherwise indicated support for the TCFD\n749 For example, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued a policy statement in 2021\nexpanding its TCFD-aligned disclosure requirements to standard issuers and formally incorporating references\nto the TCFD\u2019s Oct. 2021 guidance on metrics, targets and transition plans and updated implementation annex.\nThis policy will apply for accounting periods beginning on or after Jan. 1, 2022. The FCA requirements are\ncurrently on a comply-or-explain basis; the FCA has announced that it plans to consult on making these\nrequirements mandatory alongside future proposals adapting the rules to any future ISSB climate standard, once\nissued. See FCA, PS21/23: Enhancing Climate-Related Disclosures by Standard Listed Companies (Dec.\n2021), available at https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/policy/ps21-23.pdf. In addition, the United Kingdom has\nadopted TCFD-aligned disclosure requirements for asset managers and certain asset owners, effective Jan. 1,\n2022, with certain phase-ins. See FCA, PS21/24: Enhancing Climate-Related Disclosures by Asset Managers,\nLife Insurers and FCA-Regulated Pension Providers (Dec. 2021), available at\nhttps://www.fca.org.uk/publication/policy/ps21-24.pdf.\n750 In the European Union, the European Commission (EC) adopted a proposal for a Corporate Sustainability\nReporting Directive (CSRD), which would revise existing company reporting rules and aim to provide more\ncomparable and consistent information to investors. The CSRD proposal enlarges the scope of the reporting\nrequirements and would cover nearly 50,000 companies in the European Union. The CSRD proposal\nacknowledges the importance of the IFRS\u2019 efforts to establish the ISSB and seeks compatibility with the TCFD\nrecommendations, along with other international frameworks. The EC aims to have the new CSRD reporting\nrequirements in place for reporting year 2023. See Proposal for Directive of the European Parliament and of\nthe Council amending Directive 2013/34/EU, Directive 2004/109/EC, Directive 2006/43/EC and Regulation\n(EU) No 537/2014, as regards corporate sustainability reporting, COM (2021) 189 final (Apr. 21, 2021),\navailable at https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0189. Additionally, the EC\nis progressing work on reporting standards for meeting the proposed CSRD requirement. The European\nFinancial Reporting Advisory Group (\u201cEFRAG\u201d) published a climate standard prototype in Sept. 2021 that is\nbased on the TCFD framework. See EFRAG, Climate Standard Working Paper, (Sept. 8, 2021), available at\nhttps://www.efrag.org/News/Project-527/EFRAG-PTF-ESRS-welcomes-Climate-standard-prototype-working-\npaper?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1.\n751 Japan\u2019s Financial Services Agency (FSA) is planning to make it mandatory for large companies to make\nclimate-related disclosures aligned with the TCFD framework from as early as Apr. 2022. In addition, climate\ndisclosures have been part of Japan\u2019s corporate governance code since June 2021; however, the code is not\nlegally binding and the disclosures were introduced on a \u2018comply-or-explain\u2019 basis. In Apr. 2022, the Tokyo\nStock Exchange (TSE) will be replacing its First and Second sections, the \u201cMothers\u201d market for startups and the\ntech-focused JASDAQ, with three new segments: Prime, Standard and Growth. According to Nikkei,\ncompanies listed on the Prime market will be required to comply with disclosure requirements aligned with the\nTCFD recommendations starting in Apr. 2022.

Current Market Practices\na. Climate-Related Disclosures in SEC Filings\nThe Commission\u2019s staff reviewed 6,644 annual reports (Forms 10-K, 40-F, and 20-F)\nsubmitted from June 27, 2019 until December 31, 2020 to determine how many contain any of\nthe following keywords: \u201cclimate change\u201d, \u201cclimate risk\u201d, or \u201cglobal warming\u201d. The presence of\nany of the keywords in any part of the annual report is indicative of some form of climate-related\ndisclosure.754 Table 1 (presented as a graph in Figure 1) shows that 33% of all annual reports\ncontain some disclosure related to climate change, with a greater proportion coming from foreign\nregistrants (the corresponding percentages for Forms 20-F and 40-F are 39% and 73%,\nrespectively). Table 2 (presented as a graph in Figure 2) provides a breakdown by accelerated\nfiler status. Among large accelerated filers, 49% of filings discussed climate change, while the\nfigures for accelerated filers and non-accelerated filers are 29% and 17%, respectively. Table 3\n(presented as a graph in Figure 3), which provides a breakdown by industry groups, shows that\n752 The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) is considering proposed climate-related disclosure requirements\nlargely consistent with the TCFD recommendations, with a few exceptions. The proposed requirements would\nelicit disclosure by issuers related to the four pillars of the TCFD recommendations (Governance, Strategy, Risk\nmanagement, and Metrics and targets). The CSA anticipates that the proposed requirements would come into\nforce in 2022 and would be phased in over one and three year periods. See Consultation: Climate -Related\nDisclosure Update and CSA and Request for Comment, available at https://www.osc.ca/sites/default/files/2021-\n10/csa_20211018_51-107_disclosure-update.pdf.\n753 See TCFD 2021 Status Report, available at https://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/60/2021/07/2021-TCFD-\nStatus_Report.pdf.\n754 One limitation of using this keyword search is that it is unable to discern the extent or quality of climate-related\ndisclosures, nor can it determine specific sub-topics within climate-related disclosures. For these reasons, the\nanalysis was supplemented by natural language processing (NLP) analysis, as described later in this section.\n302\n\nthe industries with the highest percentage of annual reports containing climate-related disclosure\ninclude maritime transportation, electric services, oil and gas, steel manufacturing, and rail\ntransportation, among others.\nTable 1.

The analysis finds significant heterogeneity, both within the\nquantity and content, of climate-related disclosures across industries, as shown in Figures 4 and\n5. Figure 4 presents the intensity of disclosure for domestic filings. The intensity refers to\nsentences per firm, which is calculated by taking the aggregate number of sentences in an\nindustry and dividing it by the total number of firms within the industry (including those that do\nnot discuss climate change at all). Thus, the intensity represents a more comparable estimate\nacross industries.\nFigure 4 shows that firms in the following industries have the most ample climate-related\ndiscussion, on average: electric services, oil and gas, steel manufacturing, passenger air and air\nfreight, and maritime transportation. The majority of the discussion is on business impact,\nfollowed by emissions, international climate accords, and physical risks. Figure 5 presents the\ncorresponding information for foreign filings (Forms 40-F and 20-F). Overall, the analysis\nindicates that the majority of the disclosure is focused on transition risks, with comparatively\nfewer mentions of physical risk.\n755 The specific NLP method used in this analysis is word embedding, which utilizes Google\u2019s publicly available,\npre-trained word vectors that are then applied to the text of climate-related disclosures within regulatory filings.\nWhile this NLP analysis can be used to identify the general topic and the extent of disclosures, it is limited in its\nability to discern the quality or decision-usefulness of disclosures from investors\u2019 perspective.\n307\n\nFigure 4.

Natural language processing (NLP) is used to analyze sentences contained within the\nannual filings and classify them into four broad topics (i.e. clusters): business impact, emissions, international\nclimate accords, and physical risks. Intensity refers to sentences per firm, which is calculated by taking the\naggregate number of sentences in an industry and dividing it by the total number of firms within the industry.\nThe staff\u2019s findings are consistent with academic studies that have looked at the extent of\nclimate-related disclosures by SEC registrants. Bolstad et al. (2020) systematically reviewed\n309\n\nForm 10-K filings from Russell 3000 firms over the last 12 years and found that the majority of\nclimate-related disclosure is focused on transition risks as opposed to physical risks.756 They\nfurther report that while 35% of Russell 3000 firms provided climate-related information in\n2009, this figure grew to 60% in 2020,757 representing a significant increase. They also found\nthat the extent of disclosure for a given report has increased. In 2009, firms mentioned climate\nrisks 8.4 times on average in their Form 10-K. This figure grew to 19.1 times in 2020.\nb. Additional Trends in Climate-Related Disclosures\nWhile Commission staff reviewed certain firms\u2019 sustainability reports for climate-related\ndisclosures, they did not conduct a systematic review of a large, representative sample of\nsustainability reports. However, as discussed below, a number of industry and advocacy groups\nhave examined the scope of voluntary ESG reporting, including climate-related disclosures and\ntheir findings could be relevant to an assessment of the proposed rules\u2019 impact.\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness (CCMC),\nin collaboration with several other organizations, conducted a survey (\u201cCCMC Survey\u201d) on a\nsample of U.S. public companies \u2013 436 companies across 17 industries that range from small to\nlarge in terms of market capitalization.758 According to the survey, over half of the companies\n(52%) are currently publishing a corporate social responsibility (CSR), sustainability, ESG or\nsimilar report whose content commonly includes information regarding climate-related risks.\n756 See P. Bolstad, S. Frank, E. Gesick, and D. Victor, Flying Blind: What Do Investors Really Know About\nClimate Change Risks in the U.S. Equity and Municipal Debt Markets, Hutchins Center Working Paper 67\n(2020).\n757 Id. The methodology uses a series of keywords to determine whether a company provides climate-related\ndisclosures. Some keywords may occur in non-climate contexts, with the authors noting that the statistics are\nbiased.\n758 See Climate Change & ESG Reporting from the Public Company Perspective (2021), available at\nhttps://www.centerforcapitalmarkets.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CCMC_ESG_Report_v4.pdf.\n310\n\nThe most frequently discussed topics there are energy (74%), emissions (70%), environmental\npolicy (69%), water (59%), climate mitigation strategy (57%), and supplier environmental\npolicies (35%). Among the registrants that report climate-related information to the public, the\nmajority disclose such information via external reports or company websites rather than\nregulatory filings. Similar to the Commission staff review, the CCMC Survey finds that about a\nthird (34%) of the respondents disclose climate change, greenhouse gas emissions, or energy\nsourcing in their SEC filings information on risks. Among these firms, 82% disclose such\ninformation in Risk Factors, 26% in the MD&A, 19% in the Description of Business, and 4% in\nLegal Proceedings.\nThe Governance & Accountability Institute759 (\u201cG&A\u201d) analyzed sustainability reports\nby the companies belonging to the Russell 1000 Index and found that in 2020, 70% published\nsustainability reports \u0336 up from 65% in 2019 and 60% in 2018.760\nOther sources confirm that, at least within samples of larger firms, a sizeable portion\nalready measure and disclose their emissions, though not necessarily through their regulatory\nfilings. The CDP761 reports that out of the 524 U.S. companies in their Climate High Impact\n759 Governance & Accountability Institute Inc. (\u201cG&A, Inc.\u201d) is a consulting and research organization providing\nservices to publicly traded and privately owned companies to help enhance their public environmental, social\nand governance (ESG) and sustainability profiles.\n760 See G & A Inc., Sustainability Reporting in Focus (2021), available at https://www.ga-\ninstitute.com/research/ga-research-collection/sustainability-reporting-trends/2021-sustainability-reporting-in-\nfocus.html.\n761 CDP operates a global disclosure system that enables companies, cities, states and regions to measure and\nmanage their environmental risks, opportunities and impacts. Despite not being a framework like GRI, SASB\nand TCFD, CDP\u2019s questionnaires gather both qualitative and quantitative information from across governance,\nstrategy, risk, impact and performance. To aid comparability and ensure comprehensiveness, CDP includes\nsector-specific questions and data points. In 2018, CDP aligned its climate change questionnaire with the\nTCFD.\n311\n\nSample,762 402 disclosed through the CDP system in 2021, up from 379 in 2020, and 364 in\n2019. Out of the sample of reviewed companies, 22.1% (89 out of 402 companies) reported\nScope 3 emissions in 2021. This reflects an increase from the previous two years, during which\n18% (67 out of 379 companies) reported such information in 2020, and 17% (62 out of 364\ncompanies) in 2019.763 One commenter stated that there is significant variation in disclosure\nrates of GHG emissions across various industries.764 The commenter, using a sample of the 1,100\nU.S. companies included within the Sustainalytics dataset, reports that the disclosure rate of\nmaterial Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions is 59.5%.765 Furthermore, the International Platform on\nSustainable Finance found that among the U.S. listed firms present in the Refinitiv dataset,\n10.8% disclosed Scope 1 emissions in 2019, representing 55.4% of U.S. market capitalization.766\nTo the extent that registrants\u2019 current climate-related disclosures overlap with the proposed rules,\nregistrants may face lower incremental compliance costs, as discussed in further detail below.767\nc. Use of Third-Party Frameworks\nSome companies follow existing third-party reporting frameworks when developing\nclimate-related disclosures for SEC filings or to be included in CSR, sustainability, ESG, or\nsimilar reports. For instance, the CCMC Survey finds that 59% of respondents follow one or\n762 The CDP Climate High Impact sample identifies companies deemed high impact based on two main\nconsiderations \u2013 market cap and GHG emissions.\n763 See Letter from CDP North America (Dec. 13, 2021).\n764 See Letter from Aron Szapiro, Head of Policy Research, Morningstar (June 9, 2021).\n765 Id. The comment letter does not disaggregate the disclosure rate across the different scopes of emissions.\n766 See State and Trends of ESG Disclosure Policy Measures Across IPSF Jurisdictions, Brazil, and the US,\nInternational Platform on Sustainable Finance (2021) (The disclosure rates are calculated using data from\nRefinitiv), available at\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/business_economy_euro/banking_and_finance/documents/211104-\nipsf-esg-disclosure-report_en.pdf.\n767 See Section IV.C.2.3.\n312\n\nmore such frameworks. Among these respondents, 44% use the SASB,768 31% use the GRI,769\n29% use the TCFD,770 and 24% use the CDP.771 Similar statistics on the usage of different\nreporting frameworks are also provided by other studies. The G&A report772 finds that 53% of\nthe Russel 1000 reporters either mention or align with SASB,773 52% utilized GRI reporting\nstandards,774 30% either mention or align with TCFD recommendations,775 and 40% responded\nto the CDP Climate Change questionnaire. The law firm White & Case also conducted an in-\n768 The SASB standards are designed for communication by companies to investors about how sustainability issues\nimpact long-term enterprise value. SASB standards guide the disclosure of financially material sustainability\ninformation by companies to their investors. SASB standards, which are available for 77 industries, identify the\nsubset of ESG issues most relevant to financial performance in each industry. The SASB standards can be both\ncomplementary with the core elements of the TCFD recommendations, as well as used by organizations to\noperationalize them. See https://www.sasb.org/about/sasb-and-other-esg-frameworks/\n769 The GRI standards outline both how and what to report regarding the material economic, social and\nenvironmental impacts of an organization on sustainable development. For 33 potentially material sustainability\ntopics, the GRI standards contain disclosure requirements. Three series of GRI standards support the reporting\nprocess: the GRI Topic Standards, each dedicated to a particular topic and listing disclosures relevant to that\ntopic; the GRI Sector Standards, which are applicable to specific sectors; and the GRI Universal Standards,\nwhich apply to all organizations. The GRI Standards can be used in sustainability reports, as well as in annual\nor integrated reports that are oriented at a broad range of stakeholders. See\nhttps://www.globalreporting.org/standards/\n770 The TCFD recommended disclosures cover four core elements: Governance, Strategy, Risk Management and\nMetrics and Targets. Each element has two or three specific disclosures (as shown in Table 4) to be made in the\norganization\u2019s mainstream report (i.e. annual financial filings). These are meant to generate comparable,\nconsistent and reliable information on climate-related risks. The TCFD provides both general, and in some\ncases, sector-specific guidance for each disclosure, while simultaneously framing the context for disclosure, and\noffering suggestions on what and how to disclose in the mainstream report. See https://www.fsb-\ntcfd.org/recommendations/\n771 See supra note 761.\n772 See supra note 760.\n773 Of the Russell 1000 reporting companies, 39% indicate that they are in alignment with SASB standards, while\nthe other 14% simply mention the standards.\n774 Of those reporters utilizing the GRI standards, G&A finds that a small portion (5%) utilizes the\n\u201cComprehensive\u201d level of reporting, the majority (64%) chose to report in accordance with the \u201cCore\u201d option,\nwhile the remaining portion (31%) utilizes \u201cGRI-Referenced\u201d reports, which are not fully in accordance with\nthe GRI standards. GRI-Referenced reports contain the GRI Content Index and reference certain disclosures.\n775 Of the Russell 1000 reporting companies, 17% indicate that they are in alignment with the TCFD\nrecommendations, while the other 13% simply mention the recommendations.\n313\n\ndepth review of website sustainability disclosures by 80 small- and mid-cap firms across five\ndifferent industries and found comparable numbers.776\nWhile these various frameworks are distinct, they overlap in their alignment with the\nTCFD. In particular, the CDP questionnaire fully incorporates the TCFD framework and thus\nexhibits full alignment.777 The Corporate Reporting Dialogue778 also provides a detailed\nassessment of the various frameworks\u2019 degrees of alignment with each TCFD disclosure item,\nranging from maximum to minimum alignment as follows: Full, Reasonable, Moderate, Very\nLimited, and None. They report that the GRI exhibits \u201cReasonable\u201d alignment, while the SASB\ngenerally exhibits \u201cModerate\u201d or \u201cReasonable\u201d alignment with the majority of the TCFD\ndisclosure items. Thus, companies that report following the CDP, SASB, or GRI frameworks\nare, to varying degrees, already producing disclosures that are in line with parts of the TCFD.\nHowever, because each framework takes different approaches (e.g. intended audience, reporting\nchannel) and because certain differences exist in the scope and definitions of certain elements,\ninvestors may find it difficult to compare disclosures under each framework. Table 4 reports the\n776 See White & Case and the Society for Corporate Governance: A Survey and In-Depth Review of Sustainability\nDisclosures by Small- and Mid-Cap Companies, available at\nhttps://www.whitecase.com/publications/article/survey-and-depth-review-sustainability-disclosures-small-and-\nmid-cap-companies (Among the firms reviewed, 41 firms (51%) provided some form of voluntary sustainability\ndisclosure on their websites. Further, only nine of those 41 firms indicated the reporting standards with which\nthey aligned their reporting, with the majority of the nine companies not following any one set of standards\ncompletely. Additionally, six firms followed the GRI, while three firms stated that they follow both the TCFD\nand SASB).\n777 See How CDP is Aligned to the TCFD (2018), available at https://www.cdp.net/en/guidance/how-cdp-is-\naligned-to-the-tcfd.\n778 The Corporate Reporting Dialogue is a platform, convened by the Value Reporting Foundation, to promote\ngreater coherence, consistency and comparability between corporate reporting frameworks, standards and\nrelated requirement.

To arrive at these statistics, Moody\u2019s conducted an artificial intelligence (AI) based review of all public\nfilings, including financial filings, annual reports, integrated reports, sustainability reports, and other publicly\navailable reports that were associated with companies\u2019 annual reporting on sustainability. Non-public\ndisclosures, such as CDP reports, were not included in the analysis.\n315\n\nc) Describe the targets used by the organization to manage climate-related\n25%\nrisks and opportunities and performance against targets\nd. Climate-Related Targets, Goals, and Transition Plan Disclosures\nCarbon reduction targets or goals have become an increasing focus for both companies\nand countries.780 For example, 191 countries, including the United States and European Union,\nhave signed the Paris Climate Agreement. The agreement aims to strengthen the global response\nto the threat of climate change by keeping a rise in global temperatures to well below 2\u00ba Celsius\nabove pre-industrial levels this century, as well as pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase\neven further to 1.5\u00ba degrees Celsius.781 As of 2020, according to one source, about two-thirds of\nS&P 500 companies have established a target for carbon emissions \u2013 a number that has nearly\ndoubled over the past decade.782 Approximately one-fifth of these companies have science-based\ntargets in-line with a 1.5 degree Celsius limit on global warming.783 In addition, a growing\nnumber of companies or organizations have signed on to the Climate Pledge, which indicates a\n780 See Commitments to Net Zero Double in Less Than a Year, United Nations Climate Change (Sept. 21, 2020),\navailable at https://unfccc.int/news/commitments-to-net-zero-double-in-less-than-a-year.\n781 See Section I.\n782 See, e.g., J. Eaglesham, Climate Promises by Businesses Face New Scrutiny, The Wall Street Journal (2021),\navailable at www.wsj.com/articles/climate-promises-by-businesses-face-new-scrutiny-11636104600.\n783 See memorandum, dated Nov. 30, 2021, concerning staff meeting with representatives of Persefoni. This\nstatistic is compiled by Persefoni using information from the Science Based Targets Initiative. This and the\nother staff memoranda referenced below are available at https://www-draft.sec.gov/comments/s7-10-\n22/s71022.htm.\n316\n\ncommitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040.784 The trend in companies disclosing other\nclimate-related targets (e.g. water usage) has also been increasing over time.785\nDespite the increasing prevalence in stated targets and goals, monitoring which firms are\ntaking steps to implement them is difficult given the lack of required recurring standardized\nmetrics for progress. Absent such a monitoring device, investors have insufficient information to\ngauge the credibility of the targets. Moreover, without knowing the specific strategy that\nregistrants intend on adopting in pursuit of their targets, investors are unable to determine how\nthe targets will impact the company\u2019s financial position (e.g., a company that plans to only\npurchase offsets may face different risks and costs over time than a company that invests in\nrenewable energy or carbon capture technology).786\nConsistent with this need for an oversight or monitoring mechanism, research suggests\nthat the prevalence of \u201cgreen bonds\u201d and positive cumulative abnormal stock returns surrounding\ntheir announcements may arise, at least in part, because they help signal credible value-\nenhancing targets in the absence of mandatory standardized public disclosures.787 These findings\nsuggest a demand for such an oversight or monitoring mechanism for targets and goals among\ninvestors that would facilitate their understanding of registrants\u2019 stated climate-related targets\nand progress and the impact on the registrant\u2019s business.\n784 As of Jan. 25, 2022, The Climate Pledge has acquired 217 signatories. See The Climate Pledge, available at\nhttps://www.theclimatepledge.com/us/en/Signatories.\n785 For example, the percentage of both global and U.S. companies with water reduction targets grew by 4% in\n2019 on a year-over-year basis. This represented 28% of major global companies (i.e. those listed on the S&P\nGlobal 1200 index) and 27% of major (i.e. those listed in the S&P 500 index)) U.S. companies publicly\ndisclosing these targets. See State of Green Business 2021, available at\nhttps://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/research/state-of-green-business-2021.\n786 See S. Lu, The Green Bonding Hypothesis: How do Green Bonds Enhance the Credibility of Environmental\nCommitments? (2021), available at https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3898909.\n787 See C. Flammer, Corporate Green Bonds, Journal of Financial Economics, 499-516 (2021). (Green bonds may\nonly be a partial solution to achieving credible targets given that they have implications beyond commitment.)\n317\n\ne. Third-Party Assurance of Climate-Related Disclosures\nAmong the companies that provide climate-related disclosures, a considerable portion\ninclude some form of third-party assurance for these disclosures. The G&A study788 finds that\n35% of Russell 1000 index firms, which are virtually all large accelerated filers, obtained third-\nparty assurance for their sustainability reports in 2020, up from 24% in the year prior. The rate of\nassurance is concentrated among the larger half of the sample firms (i.e., the S&P 500 firms).\nAmong the firms that obtained assurance, however, only 3% obtained assurance for the entire\nreport. The remaining firms were evenly split between obtaining assurance on specified sections\nonly and GHG emissions only. Regarding the level of assurance, the overwhelming majority\n(90%) obtained limited assurance while only 7% obtained reasonable assurance. Regarding\nservice providers, 14% of firms received assurance from an accounting firm, 31% from small\nconsultancy/boutique firms, and 55% from engineering firms. Because these statistics are limited\nto Russell 1000 firms, corresponding figures for the full sample of U.S. registrants may be lower\nto the extent that the practice of obtaining third-party assurance is concentrated in large firms.789\n788 See supra note 760.\n789 Other studies also report evidence of third-party assurance among smaller samples of companies analyzed. For\nexample, according to a recent study by the International Federation of Accountants, in 2019, 99 out of the 100\nlargest U.S. firms by market capitalization provided some form of sustainability disclosure, which may contain\nclimate-related information among other sustainability-related topics. Seventy of those firms obtained some\nlevel of third-party assurance, with the vast majority being \u201climited assurance\u201d according to the study. Of the 70\nfirms that obtained assurance, the study reports that 54 obtained \u201climited assurance,\u201d eight obtained \u201creasonable\nassurance,\u201d five obtained \u201cmoderate assurance,\u201d and three did not disclose any assurance. Of the 81 unique\nassurance reports examined in the study, nine were found to be issued by an auditing firm, while 72 were issued\nby another service provider. See International Federation of Accountants (\u201cIFAC\u201d), The State of Play in\nSustainability Assurance (2021), available at https://www.ifac.org/knowledge-gateway/contributing-global-\neconomy/publications/state-play-sustainability-assurance. Among the sample of 436 companies included in the\nCCMC Survey, 28% disclosed that they engaged a third party to provide some form of assurance regarding their\nclimate-related disclosure (the frequency of these disclosures was 52% among the 436 companies in the\nsample).

Investors\u2019 Demand for Climate Information\nInvestors have expressed a need for information on climate-related risks as they relate to\ncompanies\u2019 operations and financial condition. 790 The results of multiple recent surveys indicate\nthat climate risks are among the most important priorities for a broad set of large asset\nmanagers.791 PWC reported in their Annual Global CEO Survey that in 2016, only 39% of asset\nand wealth management CEOs reported that they were concerned about the threats posed by\nphysical risks brought about climate change, whereas this figure increased to 70% in 2021.792\n790 See 2021 Global Investor Statement to Governments on the Climate Crisis (2021) (this statement has been\nsigned by 733 investors collectively managing over US$52 trillion in assets), available at\nhttps://theinvestoragenda.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Global-Investor-Statement-to-Governments-\non-the-Climate-Crisis.pdf; See also Alexander Karsner, Testimony Before the House Financial Services\nSubcommittee on National Security, INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND MONETARY POLICY (Sept. 11, 2019),\navailable at https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hhrg-116-ba10-wstate-karsnera-20190911.pdf. A\nrecent report examined how climate change could affect 22 different sectors of the U.S. economy and found that\nif global temperatures rose 2.8 \u00b0C from pre-industrial levels by 2100, climate change could cost $396 billion\neach year. If temperatures increased by 4.5\u02da \u00b0C, the yearly costs would reach $520 billion. See Jeremy\nMartinich and Allison Crimmins, Climate Damages and Adaptation Potential Across Diverse Sectors of the\nUnited States, NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE 9, 397\u2013404 (2019); available at\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-019-0444-6. Similarly, the Swiss Re Institute estimated how global\nwarming could affect 48 countries \u2013 representing 90% of the world economy \u2013 and found that the decrease in\nGDP in North America could range from \u2013 3.1% if Paris Agreement targets are met (a well-below 2\u00b0C\nincrease), to \u2013 9.5% if no mitigating actions are taken (3.2\u00b0C increase); See The Economics of Climate Change:\nNo Action Not an Option, available at https://www.swissre.com/dam/jcr:e73ee7c3-7f83-4c17-a2b8-\n8ef23a8d3312/swiss-re-institute-expertise-publication-economics-of-climate-change.pdf.\n791 See, e.g., Emirhan Ilhan, Climate Risk Disclosure and Institutional Investors, Swiss Fin.

A significant majority (85%) of surveyed investors cite climate risk as the\nleading issue driving their engagements with companies. These institutional investors also\nindicated that they consider climate risk to be material to their investment portfolios and are\ndemanding robust and quantifiable disclosure around its impacts and the plan to transition to net\nzero.794\nState Street Global Advisors (SSGA) and Blackrock, two of the world\u2019s largest\ninvestment managers, recently announced the focus areas for their asset stewardship program for\n2022, with climate change at the top of their priority list.

For example, disclosures by one registrant may provide investors\nwith useful information via inference with respect to peer firms. Consistent with this theory,\n805 See Section IV.B.2.b.\n806 See IOSCO, Report on Sustainability-Related Registrant Disclosures(2021), available at\nhttps://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD678.pdf.\n807 See GAO, Climate-Related Risks (2018) available at https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-18-188.pdf (reporting that\n\u201cinvestors may find it difficult to navigate through the filings to identify, compare, and analyze the climate-\nrelated disclosures across filings\u201d).\n808 Agency problems are those conflicts of interest between shareholders (i.e., the principals) and managers (i.e.,\nthe agents) of a firm.\n809 See Beyer, Cohen, Lys, and Walther, The Financial Reporting Environment: Review of The recent Literature, J.\nACCT. ECON. 296\u2013343 (2010) for a more technical and detailed discussion of these and other additional\nassumptions.\n810 See for example R.E. Verrecchia, Discretionary Disclosure, 5 JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING AND ECONOMICS 365-\n380 (1983).\n323\n\nresearch in the accounting literature has documented that earnings announcements by one firm\ncan provide predictive signals about the earnings of other firms in the same industry.811 In these\ncases, disclosures can benefit investors in the aggregate (though not necessarily investors of a\nspecific firm) by allowing them to make comparisons across firms, which can aid in their capital\nallocation decisions.\nThis illustrates how, theoretically, in the absence of mandated disclosure requirements,\nregistrants fully internalize the costs of disclosure but not the benefits, which may lead them to\nrationally under-disclose relative to what is optimal from the investors\u2019 perspective.812 As a\nresult, a tension can exist between investors (in the aggregate) and managers, where investors\nprefer more disclosure and managers prefer less. In such instances, there may be scope for\nregulation to substantially increase information provision since absent regulation, investors are\nnot able to fully ascertain the risks and opportunities that firms face.\n(2) Agency problems\nIn order for voluntary disclosure to result in the complete revelation of all relevant private\ninformation, there would need to be no agency problems (i.e., no conflicts of interest between\nmanagers and shareholders) such that managers\u2019 sole objective with respect to such disclosures\nwould be to maximize shareholder information and, ultimately, shareholder value. However, if\nmanagers have other objectives and incentives for making voluntary disclosures (i.e., there exist\nagency problems), then the voluntary disclosures may not result in the same complete\n811 See Robert Freeman and Senyo Tse, An Earnings Prediction Approach to Examining Intercompany Information\nTransfers, 15(4) J. ACCT. ECON. 509-523 (1992).\n812 It is worth noting that in some cases, undertaking costly signals can allow agents to credibly signal their type to\ninvestors. In these cases, costly disclosures can lead to a separating equilibrium where it may otherwise not\nexist. See D. Kreps and J. Sobel, 2(1) Signaling, HANDBOOK OF GAME THEORY WITH ECONOMIC APPLICATIONS,\n849-867 (1994); J. Riley, Silver Signals: Twenty-Five Years of Screening and Signaling, 39(1) JOURNAL OF\nECONOMIC LITERATURE 432-478, (2001).\n324\n\ninformation.813 Moreover, when agency problems exist, investors can no longer be sure if the\nabsence of disclosure under a voluntary regime reflects good or bad news for the firm, given that\nsome managers may have self-serving incentives. For example, managers may have career\nconcerns which could incentivize them to withhold disclosing information they expect to be\nfavorably received until it is useful to balance out bad news. In contrast, when the disclosure\nrequirements are mandatory, the relevant, complete information should be disclosed regardless\nof managers\u2019 objectives or incentives, and investors would accordingly have more confidence in\nthe completeness of the resulting disclosures. For these reasons, the benefits of a mandatory\nreporting regime may be more pronounced in settings in which disclosure-related conflicts of\ninterests exist between managers and shareholders.\n(3) Misrepresentation by managers\nIf investors are unable to verify that managerial disclosures are complete and truthful\n(e.g., if investors have difficulty in determining the extent of managers\u2019 selective disclosure of\nmetrics or methods of computation, exaggeration, obfuscation, outright misreporting, etc.), then\nvoluntary disclosures may not be fully revealing. For example, managers may be able to engage\nin misleading reporting (i.e., they can apply a favorable bias to their disclosures), but they incur a\ncost that increases with the magnitude of the misreporting.814 Under these circumstances,\ntheoretical research suggests that, in equilibrium, they may not accurately report their private\ninformation. This is because investors would not be able to distinguish truthful disclosures from\n813 See E. Einhorn. Voluntary Disclosure Under Uncertainty About the Reporting Objective, 43 JOURNAL OF\nACCOUNTING AND ECONOMICS 245-274(2007).\n814 See E. Einhorn, and A. Ziv, Biased Voluntary Disclosure, REVIEW OF ACCOUNTING STUDIES 420-442 (2012)\n(Biases in reporting can be any number of costs in these models. These include not only inefficient actual\ninvestments associated with the cost of distorted reporting, but also the risk of litigation, reputation erosion,\nand/or future flexibility in reporting.).\n325\n\nthose that are misleading (i.e., favorably biased). In this setting, all managers would then have an\nincentive to misreport by providing disclosures with a favorable bias, the extent of which\ndepends on the cost of misreporting. Furthermore, because misreporting comes at a cost, this\nwould violate the assumption of costless disclosure, which can exacerbate the issue of\nincomplete disclosures.815\nIf, on the other hand, misreporting has no costs for managers, then this results in what is\nreferred to as a cheap talk equilibrium.816 In this setting, any misalignment of incentives between\nmanagers and investors could again result in a situation in which not all relevant private\ninformation is fully revealed. While this could be driven by agency problems stemming from\nmanagerial self-interest, it also occurs when investors have heterogeneous preferences that cause\ndiffering incentives or if managers are concerned with strategic disclosures that may be viewed\nby not only investors, but also competitors, regulators, and customers.\nIn this case, a mandatory reporting regime would be beneficial to investors to the extent\nthat voluntary disclosures are unverifiable and possibly misleading. These include situations\nwhere managers obfuscate certain information in their disclosures, convey information in a\ncomplex or difficult manner, or conceal the discretionary choices with respect to what was\nreported.\n815 If misrepresentation becomes sufficiently costly, then there may be no managers who find it advantageous to\nmisrepresent, despite any potential benefits. In this case, purposeful misrepresentation would not occur, thereby\nfulfilling one of the assumptions of the standard full revelation argument. Clear guidelines for disclosure and\nimposed costs upon the discovery of misrepresentation are important mechanisms for enforcing and promoting\nthe transmission of information to investors.\n816 See V. Crawford, J. Sobel, Strategic Information Transformation, 50 ECONOMETRICA 1431-1451 (1982).\n326"

    "text": "(4) Uncertain investor responses\nAnother condition necessary for voluntary reporting to be fully revealing is that managers\nmust be certain of investor responses to disclosures. However, if investors have heterogeneous\nprior beliefs, such that managers cannot determine whether investors will consider a given\ndisclosure good or bad news, then not all managers will choose to disclose, resulting in certain\nprivate information remaining undisclosed.817 Similarly, if there are varying levels of\nsophistication among investors in their ability to understand disclosures, then again, some\nmanagers may be uncertain about how reports may be interpreted, leading them to abstain from\nsome disclosures.818 In this respect, mandatory disclosure is more likely to benefit investors in\nsettings where the types of disclosures are complex or divisive, such that managers may not be\ncertain how they will be perceived by investors with differing prior beliefs and/or sophistication.\nb. Climate-specific factors that exacerbate impediments to voluntary disclosure\nIn the context of climate-related disclosure, these impediments may be made worse due\nto agency problems arising from the potentially long-term nature of certain climate-related risks\nand other issues related to the complexity and uncertainty of climate-related factors. We explore\neach of these impediments in further detail.\nImpediments to climate-related disclosures may be exacerbated due to agency problems\nrelated to potential conflicts between short-term profitability and long-term climate risk horizons.\nPhysical and transition risks can materialize over time horizons ranging from the immediate\n817 See J. Suijs, Voluntary Disclosure Of Information When Firms Are Uncertain Of Investor Response, 43\nJOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING AND ECONOMICS 391-410 (2007).\n818 See R.A. Dye, Investor Sophistication and Voluntary Disclosures, 3 REVIEW OF ACCOUNTING STUDIES 261-287\n(1998).\n327\n\nfuture to several decades.819 Likewise, shareholders may have interests in maximizing their\ninvestment returns over both the short- and long-term. Agency problems can worsen to the extent\nthat the investment horizons of a firm\u2019s shareholders and its management are misaligned.820 If\nmanagement prioritizes short-term results821 due to pressures to perform along certain metrics,822\nmanagement may fail to assess and provide relevant disclosures on certain climate-related\nrisks,823 particularly those that are medium- or long-term in nature.824 Stock-based management\ncompensation has the potential to mitigate this issue, provided that the stock price reflects the\nvalue of the company in the long-run. However, under the current regime, certain climate-related\nrisks may be unobservable or obfuscated, and hence not fully reflected into stock prices, giving\n819 Longer horizons, for example, tend to involve changes in chronic physical risks \u2014 sea-level rise, drought, etc.\nShorter-term horizons may, instead, be relevant for any increase in acute physical risks such as hurricanes,\nwildfires, and heatwaves. See ING Climate Risk Report 2020, available at\nhttps://www.ing.com/MediaEditPage/ING-Climate-Risk-report-2020.htm.\n820 A stream of literature examines the association of climate-related disclosures with corporate governance\nstructures and managerial characteristics.

First, this uncertainty and complexity may lead to misrepresentation\nof disclosures, which, as discussed previously, violates a condition for the full revelation of\nmaterial information in a voluntary reporting environment. The complexity of these risks has led\nto many types of methodologies, metrics, and statements that can be provided to communicate\npotential economic impacts and risks.825 This multitude of choices to represent such risks may\ntherefore allow managers substantial discretion to selectively choose metrics that appear\nfavorable. If this managerial discretion is more difficult to be verified by investors, managers\nmay face lower costs for their misreporting. Moreover, the complex and multidimensional nature\nof certain climate-related risks may further impede investors\u2019 abilities to detect misreporting.\nThis could lead to a cheap-talk equilibrium, which, as previously discussed, could lead to\nclimate-related information remaining undisclosed.\nThe uncertainty and complexity of climate-related risks may also be an impediment to\nvoluntary disclosure if managers are less able to anticipate how investors may respond to such\ndisclosures. As noted above, predictable investor responses to disclosures is one of the key\nassumptions necessary for the full revelation of material information in a voluntary reporting\n825 See, e.g., TCFD, Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, at 16 (June\n2017), available at https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/FINAL-2017-TCFD-Report-\n11052018.pdf.\n329\n\nenvironment.826 Uncertainty in responses means mandatory disclosures have the potential to\nimprove information provision to investors. The challenge in anticipating investor responses to\nclimate-related disclosure may stem, in part, from the fact that the impact of these risks on\nregistrants\u2019 financial outcomes and operations can vary significantly. This challenge may be\ncompounded by the uncertainty surrounding the future path of climate change and the evolving\nnature of the science and methodologies measuring their economic impacts.827 The uncertainty\nand complexity of climate-related risks are likely to cause substantial heterogeneity with respect\nto investors\u2019 interpretation of related disclosures and their understanding of firms\u2019 exposures to\nsuch risks, resulting in heterogeneous and unpredictable investor responses. In this circumstance,\nmanagers may prefer to withhold applicable disclosures.828\nDue to these impediments, companies may not report (or may report only limited\namounts of) relevant climate-related information, and hence, the stock price that investors\nobserve may not reflect the companies\u2019 true exposures to physical and transition risks.829 Even\nwhen companies assess and disclose climate-related risks, reporting fragmentation can present\n826 In other words, this assumes that all investors uniformly interpret (and react to) managers\u2019 disclosures or their\nabsence and that investors\u2019 interpretation and reaction is known to managers.

Multiple third-party\nclimate reporting frameworks have emerged to try to fill this reporting gap.835 Due to the\nvoluntary nature of third-party frameworks, however, companies often disclose some but not all\ncomponents, and the components that are disclosed may not be the same across companies.836\n830 Carbon Disclosure Project (\u201cCDP\u201d), Pitfalls Of Climate-Related Disclosures (2020), available at Pitfalls-of-\nClimate-Related-Disclosure.pdf (rackcdn.com).\n831 See SASB, The State Of Disclosure: An Analysis of the Effectiveness of Sustainability Disclosure in SEC\nFilings, (2017), available at https://www.sasb.org/knowledge-hub/state-of-disclosure-2017/.\n832 The SASB reports that about 50% of SEC registrants provide generic or boilerplate sustainability information\nin their regulatory filings.\n833 See Vincent P.

This has resulted in considerable heterogeneity in firms\u2019 existing\ndisclosure practices.837 The wide range of reporting practices and frameworks makes it difficult\nto assess how much material climate-related information firms currently are disclosing and may\nleave opportunities for companies to omit unfavorable information.838 Some studies point to the\npotential for substantial underreporting of material climate-related information within the current\nvoluntary reporting regime.839\nThe proposed rules aim to address these market failures by requiring more specificity\naround the way registrants disclose climate-related risks and their impacts on business activities\nand operations in the short, medium, and long-term. By requiring comprehensive and\nstandardized climate-related disclosures along several dimensions, including disclosure on\ngovernance, business strategy, risk management, financial statement metrics, GHG emissions,\nand targets and goals, the proposed rules would provide investors with climate-related\n837 See Section IV.A.5. A recent survey of members of the Society for Corporate Governance (SCG) regarding the\nstate of U.S. climate risk disclosures revealed that companies are using many of the existing frameworks to\npresent emissions, environmental data, and other information on ESG issues. Many of the respondents indicated\nthat their companies are now reporting using CDP, GRI, SASB and other standards, with corporate registrants\nexpressing a desire for greater clarity regarding how to make adequate climate disclosures. The survey results\nindicate that many companies are grappling with how best to provide useful information to investors regarding\ncomplex and interrelated risks.

Benefits\nThe primary benefit of the proposed rules is that investors would have access to more\ncomparable, consistent, and reliable disclosures with respect to registrants\u2019 climate-related risks.\nAs discussed in the previous sections, investors currently face obstacles in accessing comparable,\nconsistent, and reliable climate-related information due to a combination of registrants not\ndisclosing this information at all, or registrants disclosing this information but with varying\ndegrees of coverage and specificity and in varying formats and locations, including company\nwebsites, standalone reports, and SEC filings.\nInvestors are expected to benefit from the required disclosures given that material\nclimate-related information would be provided to the market more consistently across registrants\nof different sizes and filer status, whether domestic or foreign issuers, and regardless of industry.\nInvestors are also expected to benefit from the more consistent content of the disclosures.\nSpecifically, the proposed rules would enhance comparability by requiring registrants to provide\ndisclosures on a common set of qualitative and quantitative climate-related disclosure topics in\ntheir filings.\nIn addition to the standardized content, investors are expected to benefit from a common\nlocation of the disclosures in regulatory filings. The proposed rules would require registrants to\nplace all relevant climate-related disclosures in Securities Act or Exchange Act registration\nstatements and Exchange Act annual reports in a separately captioned \u201cClimate-Related\nDisclosure\u201d section, or alternatively, to incorporate by reference from another section, such as\nRisk Factors, Description of Business, or MD&A. By mandating that standardized climate-\n334\n\nrelated information be disclosed, and requiring it to be placed in a centralized location within\nregulatory filings, the proposed rules could reduce investors\u2019 search costs and improve their\ninformation-processing efficiency. These factors can also lead to positive information\nexternalities \u2013 as more firms disclose how measures of climate risk affect their business\noperations, investors would gain a better understanding of how those same climate risks may\naffect other similar firms.841\nFurthermore, by requiring this information to be filed with the Commission as opposed to\nposted on company websites or furnished as exhibits to regulatory filings, the proposed rules are\nexpected to improve the reliability of information provided to investors moving forward.842\nSeveral commenters indicated that the treatment of climate-related disclosures as filed would\nhelp improve investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of such disclosures.843\nRecent academic work provides evidence of firms\u2019 engagement in obfuscation and other\nmisleading efforts (so-called \u201cgreenwashing\u201d)844 to manipulate the set of information available\non corporate websites and sustainability reports with the goal of attaining higher ESG ratings,\nwhich are relied upon, in particular, by unsophisticated investors for the value of institutional\n841 One study documents how investors can use information from one firm to make inferences of other similar firms\nin the context of earnings announcements. See supra note 811.\n842 By proposing to treat the proposed required climate-related disclosures as \u201cfiled,\u201d we are therefore subjecting\nthem to potential liability under Exchange Act Section 18, except for disclosures made on Form 6-K. The\nproposed filed climate-related disclosures would also be subject to potential Section 11 liability if included in or\nincorporated by reference into a Securities Act registration statement. See Section II.C.4 (discussions within).\n843 See Section II.H.k.\n844 A review of several academic papers reveal that there is no universally accepted definition of \u201cgreenwashing.\u201d\nThough the term \u201cgreenwashing\u201d is often used in industry discussions regarding ESG, the Commission does not\ndefine \u201cgreenwashing\u201d in this proposal, rules, or form amendments. Greenwashing is typically described as the\nset of activities conducted by firms or funds to falsely convey to investors that their investment products or\npractices are aligned with environmental or other ESG principles.\n335\n\ncertification.845 Direct disclosures may also reduce reliance on these ESG ratings, which are not\nnecessarily standardized nor fully transparent with respect to their methodologies. In fact, several\nstudies found low correlations of classifications across ESG providers.846 Additionally, a study\nsuggested that models and metrics used by ESG providers for appropriately classifying funds are\nnot always transparent and consistent across ESG providers.847\nAs discussed in Section IV.B.1, surveys of institutional investors indicate that climate\nrisk is one of the most prominent issues driving their investment decisions and engagements with\ncompanies. Evidence from the stock market response appears consistent with this, with increased\nmandatory ESG disclosure being associated with aggregate stock price movement.848 Such stock\nprice effects tend to display cross-sectional heterogeneity with, for example, firms disclosing\nlarge GHG emissions experiencing price declines.849 Similar effects have also been observed in\n845 See Ruoke Yang, What Do We Learn From Ratings About Corporate Social Responsibility?, R&R JOURNAL OF\nFINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION (2021), available at https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3165783.\n846 Florian Berg, Julian K\u00f6lbel, Roberto Rigobon, Aggregate Confusion: The Divergence of ESG Ratings, MIT\nSLOAN SCHOOL (Working Paper 5822-19) (May 17, 2020), available at https://ssrn.com/abstract=3438533 or\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3438533.

OECD\nanalyzed different rating providers, such as Bloomberg, MSCI and Refinitiv and found wide differences in the\nESG ratings assigned, with an average correlation of 0.4.

Taken together, the mandatory and standardized nature of the proposed\nclimate-related disclosures could benefit investors by improving their ability to assess these risks\nand their impact on registrants\u2019 financial condition and operations, thereby allowing investors to\nmake better-informed investment decisions and enhancing investor protection.\nImproving and standardizing climate disclosures also could mitigate adverse selection\nproblems that may arise in the presence of asymmetric information853 by making more accurate\nand standardized information available to the general public.854 Improved disclosure could make\nit easier for investors to process information more effectively and improve the estimation of\nfirm\u2019s future cash flows, leading to more accurate firm valuation.855 In particular, the enhanced\ndisclosures may yield further benefits for the disclosures of financial firms. Because financial\nfirms can have significant exposures to climate-related risks through their portfolio companies,\n850 E. Ilhan, Z. Sautner, G. Vilkov, Carbon Tail Risk, 34 (3) REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES 1540-1571 (2021).\n851 See supra note 802.\n852 See supra note 804.\n853 Asymmetric information occurs when one party to an economic transaction possesses greater material\nknowledge than the other party. Adverse selection occurs when the more knowledgeable party only chooses to\ntransact in settings that, based on their private information, is advantageous for them. Less informed parties\naware of their informational disadvantage might be less inclined to transact at all for fear of being taken\nadvantage of.

Agency problems could\noccur when management act opportunistically in their own self-interest at the expense of\nshareholders by disclosing only certain climate-related information at their discretion. As\npreviously discussed in Section IV.B.2.b, management may be motivated to selectively disclose\nonly climate-related information,857 while omitting harder to verify risks.858 In the context of\nclimate-related risks, agency issues may be exacerbated by the potential conflicts between short-\nterm profitability and long-term climate risk horizons859 and the misalignment of interests and\n856 In 2021, the CDP coordinated with 168 financial institutions, with a combined AUM of $17 trillion USD, to\nengage over 1,300 companies to request climate-related information, among other topics.

In\naddition, there are a number of academic studies examining the association of climate-related disclosures with\ncorporate governance structures and managerial characteristics. See, e.g., M.

Long horizons, for example, tend to involve changes in chronic physical risks \u2014 (sea-level\nrise, drought, etc.). Shorter-term horizons may, instead, be relevant for increase in acute physical risks such as\nhurricanes, wildfires, and heatwaves. See ING Climate Risk Report 2020, available at\nhttps://www.ing.com/2021-Climate-Report.htm.\n338\n\nincentives between long-term shareholders and management,860 whereby the latter may unduly\nfocus on short-term results861 given pressures to demonstrate performance.862 Under the current\nregime, many climate-related risks may be unobservable or obfuscated, giving short-term-\nfocused managers an incentive to initiate projects exposed to these risks without properly\ninforming investors.\nAgency problems might be exacerbated by registrants\u2019 use of boilerplate language or\nselective disclosure (i.e. \u201ccherry picking\u201d),863 which might reduce transparency and impair\ninvestors\u2019 ability to effectively monitor firm management. The lack of a standardized disclosure\nframework could make it easier for registrants to forego the use of certain metrics or scopes and\nomit information that might otherwise indicate shortcomings.864 Previous studies have found that\nmore detailed reporting can mitigate agency problems as it facilitates the scrutiny and discipline\nof firm management, allowing investors to monitor firms' operations more closely and thus\n860 A report by the Environmental Audit Committee of the UK House of Commons on Greening Finance, issued in\nJune 2018, found that short-termism is a pervasive problem in corporate decision making and leaves business\nill-equipped to consider and incorporate long term risks, such as climate change and sustainability.

This\ncan enable investors to better monitor firm\u2019s management, reducing agency problems and\nultimately strengthening investor protection. In the following sections, we discuss how specific\naspects of the proposed rules could contribute to the aforementioned benefits.\nThe proposed rules would mandate more detailed and comprehensive disclosure with\nrespect to climate-related risks. More consistent, comparable, and reliable disclosures could lead\nto capital market benefits in the form of improved liquidity, lower costs of capital, and higher\nasset prices (or firm valuations).866 These benefits would stem from reductions in information\nasymmetries brought about by the required disclosure of climate-related information, both\namong investors and between firms and their investors. In the first case, less information\nasymmetry among investors could mitigate adverse selection problems by reducing the\ninformational advantage of informed traders. This is likely to improve stock liquidity which, in\nturn, can attract more investors, thereby reducing the cost of capital. In the second case, less\ninformation asymmetry between firms and their investors could allow investors to better estimate\nfuture cash flows, which could reduce investors\u2019 uncertainty, as well as the risk premium they\n865 See C. Kanodia and D. Lee, Investment and Disclosures: The Disciplinary Role of Performance Reports, 36(1)\nJOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING RESEARCH 33-55 (1998); P. Healy, and K.

Economic theory illustrates how, all\nelse equal, a drop in the cost of capital leads to a boost in equity valuation, which can further\nbenefit investors.\na. Disclosure Regarding Climate-Related Risks and their Impacts on\nStrategy, Business Model, and Outlook\nThe proposed rules would require registrants to identify their climate-related risks that are\nreasonably likely to have a material impact on the registrant\u2019s business or consolidated financial\nstatements over the short, medium, and long-term and describe the actual and potential impacts\nof those risks on its strategy, business model, and outlook. Registrants would specifically be\nrequired to disclose impacts on, or any resulting significant changes made to, their: (i) business\noperations, including the types and locations of its operations; (ii) products or services; (iii)\nsupply chain or value chain; (iv) activities to mitigate or adapt to climate-related risks; and (v)\nexpenditures for research and development.\nIf, as part of its net emissions reduction strategy, a registrant uses carbon offsets or RECs,\nthe proposed rules would require it to disclose specific information around the role that carbon\noffsets or RECs play in the registrant\u2019s climate-related business strategy. If a registrant uses an\ninternal carbon price, the proposed rules would require it to disclose information around the\nboundaries for measurement of overall CO e, the price per metric ton of CO e, as well as how\n2 2\nthe total price is estimated to change over time, if applicable. Similarly, to the extent that the\nregistrant uses analytical tools such as scenario analysis, the proposed rules would require a\ndescription of those analytical tools, including the assumptions and methods used.\nThe specific disclosures required by the proposed rules are expected to improve\ninvestors\u2019 understanding of what the registrant considers to be the relevant short-, medium-, and\n341\n\nlong-term climate-related risks that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on its\nbusiness, taking into consideration the useful life of the organization\u2019s assets or infrastructure\nand the fact that climate-related risks may manifest themselves over the medium and longer\nterms. Compared to the baseline, investors would be better able to identify and assess how\nclimate-related risks may affect a registrant\u2019s businesses, strategy, and financial planning in\nseveral areas, including products and services, supply chain and/or value chain, adaptation and\nmitigation activities, investment in research and development, operations (including types of\noperations and location of facilities), acquisitions or divestments, and access to capital. Investors\nwould gain insight into how climate-related risks may serve as an input to the registrant\u2019s\nfinancial planning process and the time period(s) used for this process.\nFor example, investors may gain better insights into the registrant\u2019s estimated costs of\nany operational changes expected to be implemented to achieve emission reduction targets.\nAlternatively, investors may gain valuable information on how certain climate events may\nimpact the registrant\u2019s property, workforce, or its production schedule across the different\nphysical sites where the registrant conducts business. Adverse climate-related events may impact\nthe useful lives and/or valuation reserves of balance sheet assets. For example, sea level\nincreases and other climate related patterns may adversely impact the estimated useful lives of\ncoastal facilities. Similarly, more extreme weather patterns may adversely impact agricultural\nregions and the value of related equipment and lands. This information is expected to be useful\nfor investors in assessing how climate-related risks are managed, and whether and how these\nrisks may affect a registrant\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. The required\ndisclosure around the role that carbon offsets or RECs play in the registrant\u2019s climate-related\nbusiness strategy could help investors better understand that strategy, including how resilient it is\n342\n\nto changes in costs or the availability or value of offsets or RECs over the short, medium and\nlong-term. The required disclosures around internal carbon price, when used by a registrant,\ncould provide investors with more standardized and detailed information regarding how the\nregistrant developed a particular business strategy and help investors assess whether a\nregistrant\u2019s internal carbon pricing practice is reasonable and whether its overall evaluation and\nplanning regarding climate-related factors is sound. The required disclosure around the\nassumptions and methods used by a registrant when employing analytical tools or conducting\nscenario analysis can improve investors\u2019 assessment of the resiliency of a registrant\u2019s strategy\nand business model in light of foreseeable climate-related risks and improve investors\u2019 ability to\ncompare said resiliency among registrants.\nThe proposed requirement to identify material climate-related risks over the short-,\nmedium-, and long-term could also help mitigate agency problems deriving from the potential\nmisalignment of planning horizons between the firm\u2019s shareholders and its managers. The\ninformation required to be disclosed about the firm\u2019s business operations, products or services,\nsupply or value chain, activities to mitigate or adapt to climate-related risks, and expenditure for\nresearch and development could allow investors to assess how climate-related issues may impact\nthe registrant\u2019s financial performance (e.g., revenues, costs) and financial condition(e.g., assets,\nliabilities). These disclosures should allow investors to gain valuable insights on how resources\nare being used by management to mitigate climate-related risks and to facilitate investors\u2019\nevaluation of whether managers are taking appropriate steps to address such risks.\nb. Governance Disclosure\nThe proposed rules would require a registrant to disclose information concerning the\nboard\u2019s oversight of climate-related risks as well as management\u2019s role in assessing and\n343\n\nmanaging those risks. The proposed rules would require a registrant to disclose whether any\nmember of its board of directors has expertise in climate-related matters and the processes and\nfrequency by which the board discusses climate-related factors. When describing management\u2019s\nrole in assessing and managing climate-related factors, a registrant would be required to disclose\nwhether certain management positions are responsible for assessing and managing climate-\nrelated factors and the processes by which the responsible managers are informed about and\nmanage climate-related factors.\nThe disclosures required by the proposed rules should enable investors to better\nunderstand how the firm is informed about climate-related factors and how frequently the firm\nconsiders such factors as part of its business strategy, risk management, and financial oversight.\nInvestors would be expected to gain better information around whether the organization has\nassigned climate-related responsibilities to management-level positions or committees and, if so,\nwhether those responsibilities include assessing and/or managing climate-related risks. As a\nresult, investors may be better able to understand and evaluate the processes by which\nmanagement is informed about and monitors climate-related risks. For example, investors may\nbe better positioned to assess whether and how the firm\u2019s board and management consider\nclimate-related risks when reviewing and guiding business strategy and major plans of action,\nwhen setting and monitoring implementation of risk management policies and performance\nobjectives, and when reviewing and approving annual budgets.\nWith detailed information about climate expertise among the registrant\u2019s directors,\ninvestors could more effectively evaluate the firm\u2019s governance practices related to the\nidentification and management of climate-related risks. In particular, investors may be able to\nexercise closer oversight of management\u2019s actions as they assess implementation of risk\n344\n\nmanagement policies and performance objectives, review and approve annual budgets, and\noversee major capital expenditures, acquisitions, and divestitures.\nc. Risk Management Disclosure\nThe proposed rules would require registrants to describe their processes for identifying,\nassessing, and managing climate-related risks. This includes disclosure on how registrants assess\nmateriality, whether they consider likely future regulatory actions, how they prioritize, mitigate,\nor adapt to climate-related risks, and overall how climate-related factors are integrated into the\nregistrants\u2019 risk management systems or processes. Registrants would also be required to provide\ndetailed descriptions on any transition plans,867 as applicable, including relevant targets and\nmetrics, how physical and transition risks are managed, and actions taken and progress made\ntoward the plan\u2019s targets or goals.868\nThe disclosures required by the proposed disclosures could inform investors regarding\nhow proactive and diligent registrants may be with respect to climate-related risks. Investors can\nuse this information to acquire a more detailed understanding of how resilient registrants\u2019 risk\nmanagement systems may be towards climate-related risks, which could contribute to better-\ninformed investment or voting decisions. These disclosures could allow investors to better\nmonitor and assess whether registrants have in place adequate risk management systems and\nwhether they are aligned with investor preferences.\n867 Transition plans would be defined as a registrant\u2019s strategy and implementation plan to reduce climate-related\nphysical and transition risks and increase climate-related opportunities, including by reducing its own\nemissions. If the registrant has made a public commitment to reduce its GHG emissions by a certain date, it\nmust disclose such date and its plan to achieve its public commitment.\n868 See Section IV.C.1.f for a more detailed discussion of the potential benefits of targets and goals disclosure.\n345\n\nConversely, investors may be better able to detect whether certain registrants\u2019 risk\nmanagement systems would fail to account for certain types of climate factors such as change in\nconsumer preferences, adjustments of business models, and technological challenges or\ninnovations, which may have implications on companies\u2019 operations and financial conditions.\nThese disclosures may also allow investors to assess whether registrants are evaluating these\nrisks over specific time horizons, which may be particularly relevant in cases in which\nmanagement may be more concerned with short-term performance while neglecting longer term\nrisks. Accordingly, this provision could help address agency problems related to the\nmisalignment of planning horizons.\nd. Financial Statement Metrics\nThe proposed rules would require registrants to disclose certain disaggregated climate-\nrelated metrics in its financial statements under the following categories: (i) financial impact\nmetrics; (ii) financial expenditure metrics; and (iii) financial assumptions. The proposed rules\nwould require a registrant to disclose the impact of climate-related events (severe weather events\nand other natural conditions and physical risks identified by the registrant) and transition\nactivities (including transition risks identified by the registrant) on its consolidated financial\nstatements, if the disclosure threshold is met. For each type of metric, the provisions would\nrequire the registrant to disclose contextual information to enable the reader to understand how it\nderived the metric, including a description of significant inputs and assumptions used to calculate\nthe specified metrics, thus providing the necessary transparency for facilitating investors\u2019\nunderstanding and peer comparisons. To avoid potential confusion and to maintain consistency\nwith the rest of the financial statements, the proposed financial statement metrics would be\nrequired to be calculated using financial information that is consistent with the scope of the rest\n346\n\nof the registrant\u2019s consolidated financial statements included in the filing. The proposed rules\nwould specify the basis of calculation for the climate-related financial statement metrics and\nclarify how to apply these accounting principles when calculating the climate-related financial\nstatement metrics.\nWith respect to financial impact metrics, the proposed rules would require a registrant to\ndisclose the impacts arising from climate-related events, including physical risks identified by\nthe registrant and severe weather events and natural conditions, such as flooding, drought,\nwildfires, extreme temperatures, and sea level rise. In addition to physical risks, registrants also\nwould be required to disclose the financial impact of transition activities (including transition\nrisks identified by the registrant), such as efforts to reduce GHG emissions or otherwise mitigate\nexposure to transition risks on any relevant line items in the registrant\u2019s consolidated financial\nstatements. The proposed rule would require registrants to reflect the impact of the climate-\nrelated events or transition activities on each line item of the registrant\u2019s consolidated financial\nstatements (e.g., line items of the consolidated income statement, balance sheet, or cash flow\nstatement) unless the aggregate impact of the events and transition activities is less than one\npercent of the total line item. By exempting such line item reporting when the aggregate impact\nof the events is less than one percent, the proposed rule would reduce overall costs for firms\nassociated with disclosures for instances where the impact is likely to be quite small, while\nproviding assurance to investors that more significant impacts are reflected in line item\nreporting.869\n869 The choice of a one percent threshold is consistent with what the Commission currently uses in other contexts\nfor disclosure of certain items within the financial statements and without (e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 210.5-03.1(a), 210.12-13,\nand 229.404(d)).\n347\n\nWe expect that the proposed financial statement metrics impact would provide additional\ntransparency into the nature of a registrant\u2019s business and the significance of many of the\nclimate-related risks and impacts on its overall financial condition. Such disclosures are expected\nto provide investors with valuable insights into potential changes to, among others, revenue or\ncosts from disruptions to business operations or supply chains; impairment charges and changes\nto the carrying amount of assets due to the assets being exposed to physical risks; revenue or cost\ndue to new emissions pricing or regulations resulting in the loss of a sales contract and;\noperating, investing, or financing cash flow from changes in upstream costs, such as\ntransportation of raw materials. Separately reporting the financial statement impacts from the\nspecified climate-related events and transition activities could improve comparability of both the\nregistrant\u2019s year-to-year disclosure and between the disclosures of different registrants. Because\nthe risks presented by the climate-related events and transition activities may be correlated across\ndifferent registrants and across time, future climate-related risks could manifest in such a way\nthat a large subset of registrants are affected, making them potentially a non-diversifiable risk. In\nthis case, separate financial impact disclosures could inform investors of their exposure to these\nrisks not just for a single registrant, but across all the registrants in their portfolios. Such\ndisclosures could be beneficial as they would be informative of both individual registrant\nexposures to climate-related risks, and the level of climate-related risks in the aggregate, thus\nallowing investors to more effectively evaluate and manage the risk of their entire portfolio. .\nMoreover, to the extent that registrants are not aware of climate-related risks in the aggregate,\nthese disclosures would allow for a greater understanding of the climate-related risks they face,\nproviding them the opportunity to make more informed investment decisions taking into account\nsuch risks.\n348\n\nWith respect to financial expenditure metrics, the proposed rules would require a\nregistrant to disclose the positive and negative impacts associated with the same climate-related\nevents and transition activities as the proposed financial impact metrics. The expenditure metrics\nwould require a registrant to separately aggregate amounts of expenditure expensed and\ncapitalized costs incurred during the fiscal years presented. For each of those categories, a\nregistrant would be required to disclose separately the amount incurred during the fiscal years\npresented toward positive and negative impacts associated with the specified climate-related\nevents and to mitigate exposure to transition risks. The expenditure metrics would also be subject\nto the same disclosure threshold as the financial impact metrics, which should promote\nconsistency and clarity.\nTogether, these disclosures are expected to provide investors with information about the\ntotal expenditure toward or capitalized costs incurred for specified climate-related events. As\nsuch, they are expected to increase the resilience of assets or operations, retire or shorten the\nestimated useful lives of impacted assets, relocate assets or operations at risk, or otherwise\nreduce the future impact of severe weather events and other natural conditions on business\noperations. The proposed rules also would provide investors with information about the amount\nof expenditure expensed or capitalized costs incurred for climate-related transition activities\nrelated, among others, to research and development of new technologies, purchase of assets,\ninfrastructure, or products that are intended to reduce GHG emissions, increase energy\nefficiency, or improve other resource efficiency.\nWith respect to financial assumptions, the proposed rules would require registrants to\ndisclose whether the estimates and assumptions used to produce the consolidated financial\nstatements were impacted by risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from,\n349\n\nsevere weather events and other natural conditions, such as flooding, drought, wildfires, extreme\ntemperatures, and sea level rise. If so, the registrant would be required to provide a qualitative\ndescription of how such events have impacted the development of the estimates and assumptions\nused to prepare such financial statements. Similarly, if the estimates and assumptions were\nimpacted by potential transition risks, the registrant would be required to provide a qualitative\ndescription of how the development of the estimates and assumptions were impacted by such a\ntransition. We expect that the proposed disclosures would provide transparency to investors on\nthe impact of climate-related events and transition activities on the estimates and assumptions\nused by the registrant to prepare the financial statements and allow investors to evaluate the\nreasonableness of the registrant\u2019s estimates and assumptions.\nPrior evidence shows that existing climate-related disclosures often contain boilerplate\nlanguage or are \u201ccherry-picked\u201d to present information that is favorable to the company.870\nAccordingly, registrants under the current regulatory regime may choose to provide only brief,\nqualitative descriptions of certain climate-related factors while omitting concrete, quantitative\ninformation on how climate-related factors can impact individual financial statement line items.\nThe proposed rule may mitigate these types of agency problems by requiring registrants to\ndisclose specific, quantitative metrics according to standardized scopes and methodologies,\nthereby helping investors processing information more effectively.\nThe proposed financial metrics would be part of the financial statements and thus audited\nby an independent public accounting firm in accordance with existing Commission rules and\n870 See supra note 829 and 806.\n350\n\nPCAOB auditing standards.871 Subjecting these climate-related disclosures to reasonable\nassurance pursuant to an audit would require the auditor to assess the risk of material\nmisstatement related to the estimates and judgments, including through evaluation of the method\nof measurement and reasonableness of the assumptions used, and to understand management\u2019s\nrisk management processes, including the accuracy of the proposed disclosure, thereby\nalleviating possible concerns about the data\u2019s reliability and comparability, and improving\ninvestor confidence in such disclosure.872 Academic research finds that assurance procedures can\nincrease the relevance and reliability of disclosures, particularly for those involving significant\nestimation uncertainties. 873\ne. GHG Emissions Metrics\nThe proposed rules would require all registrants to disclose Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG\nemissions. Given the possibility of a transition to a lower-carbon economy, investors and other\nmarket participants may be concerned about registrants that have high GHG emissions since\nthese registrants may be more exposed to certain transition risks, such as regulations that restrict\nemissions or the potential impacts of changing consumer preferences or market conditions.\nShould a transition to a low-carbon economy gain momentum, registrants with higher amounts of\n871 Such audits could increase the probability of discovering and penalizing any misrepresentation. Since this\nwould increase the expected costs of engaging in misrepresentation, as discussed in Section IV.B.2, this would\nalso be likely to increase the odds of accurate revelation of material information.\n872 See Section II.F.5.\n873 See M. DeFond and J. A. Zhang, A Review of Archival Auditing Research, 58(2-3) Journal of Accounting and\nEconomics 275-326 (2014); V.K. Krishnan, The Association Between Big 6 Auditor Industry Expertise and the\nAsymmetric Timeliness of Earnings 20 Journal of Accounting, Auditing and Finance 209-228 (2005); W.\nKinney and R. Martin, Does Auditing Reduce Bias in Financial Reporting? A Review of Audit-Related\nAdjustment Studies, 13 AUDITING: A JOURNAL OF PRACTICE & THEORY 149-156 (1994); K.B. Behn, J.H. Choi,\nand T. Kang, (2008), Audit Quality and Properties of Analyst Earnings Forecasts 83 THE ACCOUNTING REVIEW\n327-349 (2008). Some commenters expressed similar views. See, e.g., Comment Letters from CAQ, Ceres;\nImpax Asset Management; San Francisco Employees\u2019 Retirement System; and UNEP-FI.\n351\n\nScope 1 and 2 emissions may be more likely to face sharp declines in cash flows, either from\ngreater costs of emissions or the need to scale back on high-emitting activities, among other\nreasons, as compared to firms with lower amounts of such emissions.\nUnderstanding the extent of this potential exposure to transition risks could help investors\nin assessing their risk exposures with respect to the companies in which they invest. Greater\nconsistency in emissions disclosures can further benefit investors as it can facilitate comparisons\nbetween the registrants and their peers and assist in understanding the overall risk of their\nportfolios. As described below, emissions disclosures would also help inform investors about\nthe extent to which a company has been or is following through with its disclosed strategies and\ntransition plans. As further discussed in Section IV.D, we expect this provision to lower\nuncertainty for investors, thereby reducing the cost of capital. This may make it easier to raise\nequity and debt, or to obtain loan financing.\nBesides the direct risk to cash flows through cost of emissions or the need to scale back\non high-emitting activities, such a transition could also cause a registrant\u2019s assets to suffer from\nunanticipated or premature write-downs, devaluations, and/or adverse adjustments in reserves.\nThe proposed Scope 1 and 2 emission disclosures would allow investors to identify registrants\nwhose assets may be more likely to become obsolete or non-performing or lose economic value\nahead of their anticipated useful life due to a potential transition to a lower-carbon economy, and\nmore generally allow investors to discern whether certain investments are unlikely to earn the\nanticipated economic return due to such transition. The proposed disclosures would also allow\ninvestors to more closely monitor whether a firm\u2019s management is properly accounting for the\nimpairment of such stranded assets to ensure that they are recorded on the balance sheet as a loss\nof profit and are not carried at more than their recoverable amount. Given the significant\n352\n\npossibility that Scope 1 and 2 emissions will affect the valuation of the registrant through\nimpacts on earnings, cost of capital, investor demand, or potentially some other channel, investor\nprotection would be enhanced by requiring disclosure of this information.\nMoreover, by specifying that the information should be provided by all registrants,\ninvestors would benefit from having access to a more comprehensive set of emissions data\nagainst which to measure a registrant\u2019s progress in meeting any stated emissions goals or\notherwise managing its climate-related risks, as a part of assessing the registrant\u2019s overall\nbusiness and financial condition. In the absence of the proposed rules, some registrants may\nchoose to selectively omit quantitative emissions metrics. The resulting state of disclosures is\nless meaningful and less transparent, making it significantly more difficult for investors to assess\nthe degree of risk in individual firms, to compare across firms, and to value securities.\nAs discussed in Section IV.A, some registrants currently report emissions via the EPA\u2019s\n2009 mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program.874 However, the nature of the reporting\nrequirements and the resulting data is more suited to the purpose of building a national inventory\nof GHG emissions, not of assessing emissions-related risks to individual registrants. Specifically,\ndirect emitters must report their emissions at the facility-level (not registrant-level) and suppliers\nof certain products must report their \u201csupplied emissions,\u201d conditional on these emissions\nexceeding a specified threshold.875 In addition, as previously discussed, the EPA emissions data\ndoes not allow a clean disaggregation across the different scopes of emissions for a given\nregistrant.876 From the point of view of an investor seeking greater information regarding a\n874 See Section IV.A.3.\n875 See supra note 737.\n876 See Section IV.A.3.\n353\n\nregistrant, the EPA\u2019s emissions data may be difficult for investors to use, because the data are\nmade public by facility and not by company. While each facility is matched to its parent\ncompany, this company may not be the entity registered with the SEC and thus of interest to\ninvestors. Taken together, the EPA emissions data is not well suited to enabling investors to fully\nassess the degree to which each registrant is exposed to transition risks.\nThe proposed rules would result in more comprehensive and tailored emissions\ninformation by requiring disclosure of Scope 1, Scope 2, and in some cases Scope 3 emissions by\nregistrants in SEC filings. Prior evidence has shown that when information that is already\npublicly available elsewhere is included within SEC filings, the public becomes more aware of\nthe information.877 While there are numerous differences with regard to EPA reporting, this\nevidence suggests that even were these differences not to exist, and the only change were to be\ninclusion in SEC filings, there would nonetheless be an advantage in improving consistency and\nreliability and decreasing search costs.\nThe proposed rules would also provide informational benefits beyond the voluntary\ndisclosure of emissions in sustainability reports. While currently disclosed information reflects\ninvestor demand, the overall information disclosed to the market may be biased due to its\nvoluntary nature, in that companies that have more favorable data (e.g., lower emissions) may be\nmore likely to make these voluntary disclosures. Requiring all registrants to provide consistent\ndisclosures, as proposed, would reduce the bias that can result from a voluntary regime.\nMoreover, as discussed above, locating the information in SEC filings may make it more\naccessible to investors and contribute to greater consistency and reliability.\n877 See H.B. Christensen, E. Floyd, L.Y. Liu, and M Maffett, The Real Effects of Mandated Information on Social\nResponsibility in Financial Reports: Evidence from Mine-Safety Records, 64 (2-3) JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING\nAND ECONOMICS 284-304 (2017).\n354\n\nSpecific provisions are designed to facilitate comparability across registrants and\nindustries. For example, requiring the disclosure of GHG intensity in terms of metric tons of\nCO e per unit of total revenue and per unit of production would allow investors to directly assess\n2\nthe efficiency of the registrant\u2019s operations and compare across different industries and firms of\nvarying size. Increased standardization in the reporting of these metrics may allow investors to\nassess more effectively a registrant\u2019s transition risk against that of its competitors. As another\nexample, the proposed rules would require a registrant to set the organizational boundaries for its\nGHG emissions disclosure using the same scope of entities, operations, assets, and other\nholdings within its business organization structure as those included in its consolidated financial\nstatements. Requiring a consistent approach would avoid potential investor confusion about the\nreporting scope used in the financial statements and enhance comparability across registrants,878\nhelping investors in assessing a registrant\u2019s transition risk against that of its competitors.\nThe proposal would also require non-SRC registrants to disclose Scope 3 emissions if\nmaterial or if the registrant has a target or goal related to Scope 3.879 In addition, specified\nregistrants would also be required to disclose the methodology used to compute emissions, the\nbreakdown of the different GHGs, as well as upstream and downstream activities, and data\nquality.880 Scope 3 emissions GHG emissions can represent the majority of the carbon footprint\n878 Unlike the GHG Protocol, which currently provides different options for setting organizational boundaries, the\nproposed rules would require that the scope of consolidation and reporting be consistent for financial data and\nGHG emissions data.\n879 The proposed rules include a safe harbor for Scope 3 emissions disclosure from certain forms of liability under\nthe federal securities laws.\n880 In calculating Scope 3 emissions, registrants have the flexibility to choose a methodology they deem fit,\nhowever, the specific methodology must be disclosed. Estimates or ranges are permitted. Emissions reporting\nmust be presented as CO e as well as disaggregated into the different types of GHGs.\n2\n355\n\nfor many companies, in some cases as high as 85% to 95%.881 For example, according to Morgan\nStanley Capital International (MSCI), the Scope 3 emissions of the integrated oil and gas\nindustry are more than six times the level of its Scope 1 and 2 emissions.882 Companies may have\nindirect control over their Scope 3 emissions through choices they make, for example in\nselecting suppliers, designing products, or sourcing inputs more efficiently. Nevertheless, the\nmajority of companies do not typically report this information. As of July 10, 2020, for example,\nwithin the sample of companies belonging to the MSCI ACWI Investable Market Index (IMI),883\nthe total Scope 3 average intensity was almost three times greater than the combined Scope 1 and\n2 intensity. Yet, only 18% of constituents of the MSCI ACWI IMI reported Scope 3 emissions,\nwith even lower reporting percentages when looking at the individual Scope 3 categories.884\nThe reporting of Scope 3 emissions for these registrants would provide additional\nbenefits for investors. Scope 3 emissions information may be material in a number of situations\nto help investors gain a more complete picture of the transition risks to which a registrant may be\nexposed. Relative to registrants with substantial Scope 1 and 2 emissions, future regulations that\nrestrict emissions may impact registrants with high Scope 3 emissions differently. In certain\nindustries, a transition to lower-emission products or processes may already be underway,\n881 See Eric Rosenbaum, Climate experts are worried about the toughest carbon emissions for companies to capture\n(Aug. 18, 2021) available at https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/18/apple-amazon-exxon-and-the-toughest-carbon-\nemissions-to-\ncapture.html#:~:text=Scope%203%20carbon%20emissions%2C%20or,as%2085%25%20to%2095%25.\n882 See also MSCI, Emissions: Seeing the Full Picture (Sept. 17, 2020), available at\nhttps://www.msci.com/www/blog-posts/scope-3-carbon-emissions-seeing/02092372761\n883 The MSCI ACWI Investable Market Index (IMI) captures large, mid and small cap representation across 23\nDeveloped Markets and 25 Emerging Markets countries, covering approximately 99% of the global equity\ninvestment opportunity set.\n884 Ibid.\n356\n\ntriggered by existing policies, a shift in consumer preferences, technological changes, or other\nmarket forces.\nRegistrants with significant Scope 3 emissions may be more likely to face disruptions not\nonly in their cash flows, but also in their business models or value chains to the extent that these\nregistrants are compelled to make changes in their products, suppliers, distributors, or other\ncommercial partners.885 Moreover, if consumer demand changes to favor less carbon intensive\nproducts, companies with high Scope 3 emissions may see a marked reduction in demand for\ntheir products, and companies that are not aware of these risks could be less profitable relative to\nthose that understand these risks and are prepared to mitigate them. Alternatively, companies that\ncan source inputs that involve less GHG emissions could achieve potential cost savings and those\nthat could produce products that generate less GHG emissions by the end user could potentially\nenjoy higher demand. Some registrants may plan to shift their activities to capitalize on these\nchanges and thus may need to allocate capital to invest in lower emissions equipment or to create\nnew types of products. Investors would need information about the registrants\u2019 full GHG\nemissions footprint and intensity to determine and compare how exposed a registrant is to the\nfinancial risks associated with a transition to lower-carbon economy.\nOver the last few years, a number of studies have shown that firms try to reduce their\nlocal carbon footprints by outsourcing their carbon emissions to suppliers in states or countries\n885 Scope 3 upstream and downstream emissions represents a substantial portion of global GHG emissions. For\nexample, according to a recent report, Scope 3 downstream emissions that happen after a product or service\nleaves a company\u2019s control/ownership represented about 49 % of global GHG emissions in 2019. Capital goods\n(87%), banks (81%) and retailing (80%) were among the industries with the highest percentage of Scope 3\ndownstream emissions relative to their total emissions. These downstream emissions can come from a variety of\nsources. For example, capital goods activities include emissions from raw material manufacturing and transport.\nBanks emit few GHGs to run their operations, \u2014 but finance the emissions of other companies through loans\nand investments. See State of Green Business 2021, available at\nhttps://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/research/state-of-green-business-2021.\n357\n\nwith weaker environmental policies.886 These studies provide evidence of the substitutional\nrelationship between direct and outsourced GHG emissions. Recent studies have also analyzed\nthe substitution effects between Scope 1 and Scope 3 GHG emission activities of U.S. firms. The\nfindings show that the relative share of Scope 1 emissions out of a firm\u2019s total emissions tend to\nfall at the expense of the rising proportion of its supplier-generated Scope 3 emissions and that a\nfirm\u2019s imports further augment the substitutional relationship between its Scope 1 and Scope 3\nemissions.887 In addition to the outsourcing incentives related to regulatory arbitrage, the authors\nof these studies posit that firms may also be outsourcing emissions abroad to exploit investors\u2019\ncurrent difficulties in assessing the firm\u2019s carbon emissions through imports along the upstream\nsupply chain. By requiring the disclosure of Scope 3 GHG emissions, the proposed rules would\nmake it more difficult for non-SRC registrants to avoid investors\u2019 scrutiny by outsourcing all or\npart of their activities abroad.\nFinally, as described in Section IV.A5.d, many companies have set emissions targets, and\nit is not always clear whether these targets pertain to Scope 3 emissions or not. As explained in\nSection IV.C.1.g, registrants would be required to disclose whether the targets pertain to Scope 3\nemissions, and as described above, if they do, they would need to report such emissions.\nWithout reporting of Scope 3 emissions amounts and categories, investors would not have the\ninformation they need to understand the scale and scope of actions the company may need to\n886 See, e.g. I Ben-David, Y. Jang, S. Kleimeier, and M. Viehs, Exporting Pollution: Where Do Multinational\nFirms Emit CO2? 36 (107) ECONOMIC POLICY 377\u2013437 (2021); X. Li and Y.M. Zhou, Offshoring\nPollution While Offshoring Production? 38 STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL 2310\u20132329 (2017).\n887 See R. Dai, R. Duan, H. Liang, and L. Ng, Outsourcing Climate Change (SSRN Working Paper)(2021),\navailable here https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3765485.\n358\n\ntake to fulfill its commitment, and thus the overall financial implications of a registrant\u2019s targets.\nFor example, a registrant\u2019s disclosure of its Scope 3 emissions, together with the proposed\nfinancial statement metrics, could allow investors to assess the potential (additional) investments\nthe registrant may need to make to meet a certain goal. Moreover, as described further below,\nreporting of Scope 3 emissions gives a quantitative metric for investors to track, thus reducing\nopportunities for misleading claims on the part of the registrant.\nBecause the value of a firm\u2019s equity is largely derived from expected future cash flows,\ndisclosure of Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions can help investors incorporate risks associated with\nsuch future cash flows into asset values today. Indeed, the academic literature indicates that\nequity is a long-term asset, meaning that even risks related to regulatory changes in the distant\nfuture could be priced today.888 Thus, for many registrants, reasonable investors may view GHG\nemissions as necessary to assess the registrants\u2019 exposure to climate-related risks, particularly\ntransition risks, and whether they have developed strategies to reduce their carbon footprint in\nthe face of potential regulatory, policy, and market constraints. This may be particularly\nimportant in light of the investor demand documented in IV.B.1 and the potential price impact,\nas discussed in IV.D.\n888 See J. van Binsbergen, Duration-Based Stock Valuation: Reassessing Stock Market Performance and Volatility\n(2021), available at https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3611428; D. Greenwald, M.\nLeombroni, H. Lustig, and S. van Nieuwerburgh, Financial and Total Wealth Inequality with Declining Interest\nRates (2021), available at https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3789220. Both of these papers\nfind that the Macauley duration of equity, the weighted average length of time which investors will receive the\ncash flows from the asset, is in excess of 35 years as of 2019. This indicates that changes in cash flows in the\ndistant future can impact equity prices today.\n359\n\nf. Assurance of GHG Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosures for large\naccelerated filers and accelerated filers\nThe proposed rules would require registrants that are large accelerated filers and\naccelerated filers to provide an attestation report for the registrant\u2019s Scope 1 and 2 GHG\nemissions disclosures. Large accelerated filers constitute approximately 31% of the universe of\nregistrants that filed annual reports during calendar year 2020 (1,950 out of 6,220), but account\nfor 93.6% of market cap within the same universe. Accelerated filers constitute approximately\n10% of the universe of registrants that filed annual reports during calendar year 2020 (645 out of\n6,220) and account for 0.9% of market cap within the same universe.\nThe proposed rules provide specific transition periods for obtaining attestation reports.\nLarge accelerated filers would be required to provide Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosures in the\nfiscal year immediately following rule adoption. Next, they would be required to obtain limited\nassurance over these disclosures in fiscal years 2 and 3 after adoption. They would then be\nrequired to obtain reasonable assurance over these disclosures in fiscal year 4 after adoption and\ngoing forward. Accelerated filers would follow the same timeline but with a delay of one fiscal\nyear. Specifically, accelerated filers would be required to provide Scopes 1 and 2 emissions\ndisclosures in fiscal year 2 after adoption. Next, they would be required to obtain limited\nassurance over these disclosures fiscal years 3 and 4 after adoption. They would then be required\nto obtain reasonable assurance over these disclosures in fiscal year 5 after adoption and going\nforward.\nThe proposed transition periods for assurance over large accelerated filers\u2019 and\naccelerated filers\u2019 Scopes 1 and 2 GHG emission disclosures are intended to provide these\nregistrants time to familiarize themselves with the GHG emissions disclosure requirements,\n360\n\ndevelop the relevant DCP, and provide the market with an opportunity to develop enough\nexpertise to satisfy the increased demand for GHG emission assurance services. We expect that\nduring the proposed transition periods, the market for assurance services would further mature\nwith respect to institutional knowledge, procedural efficiency, and overall competition, thus\nlowering costs for registrants and improving the quality of service. Although Scope 3 GHG\nemissions can constitute a large portion of a registrant\u2019s total emission, the proposed rules would\nexclude Scope 3 GHG emission disclosures from the attestation requirement due to the unique\nchallenges associated with their measurement, which is based on data sources not owned by the\nregistrant,889 as well as the potential higher costs associated with their verification.\nSection IV.A.5.e above discusses survey evidence on the frequency with which firms\nobtain assurance in sustainability reports. This evidence suggests that a significant fraction of\nlarge companies already obtain some form, albeit limited, of assurance. Practices appear to be\nfragmented with respect to the levels of assurance provided, the assurance standards used, the\ntypes of service providers, and the scope of disclosures covered by the assurance. One\nconsequence of such fragmentation has been a lack of clarity about the nature of assurance\nprovided, which can lead to confusion for investors when assessing the quality of disclosures.\nMoreover, as noted above, the voluntary nature of the reporting could result in biased or\nincomplete data. The fact, however, that a significant proportion of large companies already\nobtain some form of assurance over this information is indicative of investors\u2019 and companies\u2019\nneed for such disclosures to be reliable.\n889 See Section II.G.3.\n361\n\nThe importance of assurance for climate-related information also is highlighted by the\nInternational Federation of Accountants, which recently published its Vision for High-Quality\nSustainability Assurance.890 As discussed earlier, contrary to other quantitative information that\nis provided outside of the financial statements, and which is typically derived from the same\nbooks and records that are used to generate a registrant\u2019s audited financial statements, GHG\nemissions disclosures are not developed from information that is included in the registrant\u2019s\nbooks and records.891 Accordingly, such quantitative disclosure is not be subject to audit\nprocedures as part of the audit of the financial statements in the same filing. Because of this, the\nproposed requirement of a third-party attestation report may be particularly beneficial to verify\nthe reliability of such quantitative information and enhance its accuracy.. In general, subjecting\nclimate-related disclosures to assurance would require the assurance provider to assess the risk of\nmaterial misstatements related to the estimates and judgments, including through evaluation of\nthe method of measurement and reasonableness of the assumptions used, and an understanding\nof management\u2019s risk management processes, including the risks identified and the actions taken\nto address those risks.892 Moreover, by specifying minimum standards for the assurance\nprovided with respect to GHG Scope 1 and 2 emissions disclosures, we expect the proposed rules\nto promote accuracy and consistency in the reporting of this information, while also providing\ninvestors with a baseline level of reliability against which to evaluate the disclosures.893\n890 See IFAC Charts the Way Forward for Assurance of Sustainability Information (Dec. 6, 2021), available at\nhttps://www.ifac.org/news-events/2021-12/ifac-charts-way-forward-assurance-sustainability-information.\n891 See Section II.H.1 for more information.\n892 See PCAOB, AS 2110 Identifying and Assessing Risks of Material Misstatement (2010).\n893 See K. Hodge, K., N. Subramaniam, J. Stewart, Assurance of Sustainability Reports: Impact on Report Users'\nConfidence and Perceptions of Information Credibility, (19) Australian Accounting Review 178-194 (2009),\navailable at https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1835-2561.2009.00056.x\n362\n\nAcademic research finds that assurance procedures can increase the relevance and\nreliability of disclosures,894 particularly for those involving significant estimation uncertainties.\nWhile most of this academic evidence focuses on the effects of reasonable assurance procedures,\nwe cannot preclude the possibility that such findings may have implications for limited assurance\nas well. Experimental evidence has found that both limited and reasonable assurance can\nincrease perceived reliability of sustainability reports, but those same studies do not find a\nstatistically significant difference between limited and reasonable assurance.895 Obtaining\nassurance for sustainability reports, which as noted above is typically limited assurance, has also\nbeen associated with firms with lower costs of capital, increased analyst coverage, and decreased\nanalyst forecast errors and forecast dispersion.896\nThe proposed rules would require the attestation report to identify the criteria against\nwhich the subject matter was measured or evaluated, the level of assurance provided, the nature\nof the engagement, and the attestation standard used. In particular, the proposed rules would\n894 See supra note 873.\n895 See, e.g., K. Hodge, K., N. Subramaniam, and J. Stewart, Assurance of Sustainability Reports: Impact on Report\nUsers' Confidence and Perceptions of Information Credibility, 19 AUSTRALIAN ACCOUNTING REVIEW 178-194\n(2009), available at https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1835-2561.2009.00056.x; Mark Sheldon, User Perceptions of CSR\nDisclosure Credibility with Reasonable, Limited and Hybrid Assurances (Dissertation) (2016) available at\nhttps://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/65158/Sheldon_MD_D_2016.pdf. This absence of\nevidence, however, is not necessarily evidence of absence. It is possible that reasonable assurance can have\nbenefits over limited assurance that are not easily identifiable.\n896 See R.J. Casey and J.H. Grenier, Understanding and contributing to the enigma of corporate social\nresponsibility (CSR) assurance in the United States, 34(1) AUDITING: A JOURNAL OF PRACTICE & THEORY 97,\n97-130 (2015). The authors also find that the lower costs of capital are in excess of estimated assurance costs\n(i.e., 5% to 10% of total audit fees) for the majority of companies. We acknowledge, however, that the benefits\ncited in this study may be overstated to the extent that they reflect a selection bias. Specifically, companies that\nanticipate a net loss due to assurance would choose to forgo obtaining such assurance, thereby removing\nthemselves from the treatment group. This potential limitation in interpreting such findings is also supported by\nevidence of systematic differences in companies voluntarily reporting higher assurance levels. See C. H. Cho,\nG. Michelon, D. M. Patten, and R. W. Roberts, CSR report assurance in the USA: an empirical investigation of\ndeterminants and effects, 5(2) SUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING, MANAGEMENT AND POLICY JOURNAL 130, 130-\n148 (2014), available at https://doi.org/10.1108/SAMPJ-01-2014-0003.\n363\n\nrequire the attestation report to include a description of the work performed as a basis for the\nattestation provider\u2019s conclusion and for that conclusion to be provided pursuant to standards\nthat are established by a body or group that has followed due process procedures, including the\nbroad distribution of the framework for public comment. We expect this provision would help\nensure that the standards upon which the attestation report is based were the result of a\ntransparent and reasoned process. In this way, the requirement should help to protect investors\nwho may rely on the attestation report by limiting the standards used to those that are appropriate\nfor the subject matter and purpose. Further, we expect this provision to enhance the transparency\nof the GHG emissions attestation report for investors by providing them with additional\ninformation about the general procedures undertaken by the attestation provider. For example,\nunder the proposed rules, an attestation report providing limited assurance would need to state\nthat the procedures performed vary in nature and timing from, and are less extensive than, a\nreasonable assurance engagement, thus helping investors understand the level of assurance\nprovided.\nThe GHG emissions attestation report would also be required to include a statement that\ndescribes any significant limitations associated with the measurement or evaluation of the subject\nmatter against the criteria. The provision would require disclosure about the estimation\nuncertainties inherent in the quantification of GHG emissions, driven by reasons such as the state\nof the science and assumptions used in the measurement and reporting processes. By eliciting\ndisclosure with respect to the procedures undertaken by the attestation provider, such as inquiries\nand analytical procedures, and the methodology used in the attestation process, the proposed\nprovision would enhance the transparency of the GHG emissions attestation quality, thus\nallowing investors to gain a better understanding of the emission related information. This could\n364\n\nhelp investors process emission related information more effectively. More informed investment\ndecisions by investors also may benefit registrants by lowering their cost of capital.\nThe proposed rules would also require registrants to disclose whether the attestation\nprovider has a license from any licensing or accreditation body to provide assurance and whether\nthe GHG emissions attestation engagement is subject to any oversight inspection program and\nrecord-keeping requirements with respect to the work performed for the GHG emissions\nattestation. These requirements are expected to benefit investors by helping them to better\nunderstand the qualifications of the GHG emissions attestation provider, which in turn would\nallow them to make better informed decisions about the reliability of such information.\nFinally, the proposed rules would require that the GHG emissions attestation report be\nprepared and signed by a provider that is an expert in GHG emissions and independent with\nrespect to the registrant, and any of its affiliates, for whom it is providing the attestation report.\nThese qualification and independence requirements should help ensure that the attestation\nprovider is capable of exercising informed, objective and impartial judgment. Academic research\nhas found that the independence of assurance providers can be important in certain settings for\ndisclosure quality.897 Academic research has also found that equity prices respond to analyst\nforecast even after management has released the exact same information, highlighting more\ngenerally the perceived value of external evaluations of firm disclosures and resulting investor\nconfidence in the related disclosures.898\n897 See N. Tepalagul, and L. Lin, Auditor Independence And Audit Quality: A Literature Review, 30(1) JOURNAL\nOF ACCOUNTING, AUDITING & FINANCE 101-121 (2015) (for a more detailed discussion on academic evidence\non independence in auditing).\n898 See Marco Grotteria, and Roberto Gomez Cram, Do Financial Investors Underreact To Voluntary Corporate\nDisclosure? (Working Paper) (2022).\n365\n\ng. Targets and Goals Disclosure\nThe proposed rules would require a registrant to disclose whether it has set any climate-\nrelated targets or goals and, if so, how it intends to meet those targets and goals. Such climate-\nrelated targets or goals might relate to the reduction of GHG emissions or address energy usage,\nwater usage, conservation or ecosystem restoration. Associated disclosure would include the\nscope of activities and emissions included in the target, the unit of measurement, and the defined\ntime horizon. Additionally, disclosures include the baseline emissions for measuring progress,\nany interim targets, how it intends to meet these targets or goals, and data showing any progress\ntoward achieving these targets, including how that progress was achieved, and details about any\ncarbon offsets of RECs that have been used.\nFor example, in 2019 Amazon and Global Optimism co-founded The Climate Pledge, a\ncommitment to net zero carbon by 2040. Since then, a growing list of major companies and\norganizations have signed on to the Climate Pledge, which indicates a commitment to the\nfollowing three principles: (i) Measure and report greenhouse gas emissions on a regular basis;\n(ii) Implement decarbonization strategies in line with the Paris Agreement; (iii) Neutralize any\nremaining emissions with additional offsets to achieve net zero annual carbon emissions by\n2040.899 The proposed rules would help to make such commitments more transparent by\nrequiring disclosure on the unit of measurement, time horizon, and baseline for measuring\nprogress, including how that progress was achieved (e.g. through efficiency improvements,\nrenewable energy adoption, materials reductions, and other carbon emission elimination\nstrategies).\n899 As of Jan. 25, 2022, The Climate Pledge has acquired 217 signatories. See The Climate Pledge, available at\nhttps://www.theclimatepledge.com/us/en/Signatories.\n366\n\nSuch standardized reporting as a form of an oversight or monitoring mechanism might be\ncritical in overcoming agency problems in the presence of asymmetric information. Investment\nin achieving targets could be value-enhancing in the long-run, but reduce cash flow in the short-\nrun. Companies may decide that it is an optimal strategy to bear the costs up front of shifting its\noperations to those that have fewer emissions or upgrading their equipment, rather than bearing\nthe risk that these costs will be borne in an unpredictable and possibly disorderly way in the\nfuture. In the absence of a means to credibly convey that efforts to achieve these long-term\ntargets are being undertaken diligently, however, investors might be unable to observe which\nregistrants are actually following through on such actions. For example, if registrants are\nincurring costs in the short-run to undertake investments to reduce Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions,\nreducing short-run profitability, but are unable to convey to investors that they are meaningfully\nfollowing through on achieving potential long-term value-enhancing strategies, there could be a\ndisincentive for investors to invest in the firm, thus undermining its value in the long-run. This\nhas been put forth as one potential explanation for some private sector attempts at addressing\nthese problems, such as green bonds, which commit firms to recurring, more standardized\ndisclosure requirements for progress in achieving stated targets and goals.900 The proposed rules\nwould provide enhanced transparency about targets and goals so that investors can identify\nregistrants with credible goals and track their progress over time. This can not only reduce\nincentives for misleading goal disclosures, but can also allow investors to recognize goals that\ngenerate long-term value despite short run costs, which can attract capital and increase firm\nvalue.\n900 See S. Lu, The Green Bonding Hypothesis: How do Green Bonds Enhance the Credibility of Environmental\nCommitments? (2021), available at https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3898909.\n367\n\nAs explained above, the pursuit of targets could have a material impact, either in the\nshort-term or long-term, on a registrant\u2019s operations or financial condition.901 At this time,\nhowever, there is little consistency with respect to the extent of disclosure and the relevant\ndetails concerning such climate-related targets and goals. This can result in insufficient\ninformation for investors\u2019 monitoring or decision-making needs. The proposed disclosure could\nprovide more comparable, consistent, and reliable metrics of any climate-related targets or goals.\nIt would require a registrant to clearly define baselines for targets, the scope of activities and\nemissions covered by the target, the unit of measurement, the defined time horizon, and how\nprogress is made towards the targets. For example, the disclosure would require the registrant to\nstate whether or not the targets pertain to Scope 3 emissions. If targets do include Scope 3\nemissions, disclosure of Scope 3 emission sources and amounts would be required so that\ninvestors would understand the scale and scope of changes the company would need to\nundertake, and thus the full financial impact of meeting the target.902 Such disclosures would\nalso enable investors to monitor progress firm management has made and plans to make towards\nachieving climate-related targets or goals, assess the credibility of its goal, and evaluate the\neffectiveness of the company\u2019s investments to achieve its goals. As described above, this\nrequired disclosure could make targets more credible and serves as an oversight or monitoring\nmechanism.\n901 See supra Sections II.G.1.b. and III C.1.e.\n902 See id.\n368\n\nh. Structured Data Requirement\nUnder the proposed rules, the new climate-related disclosures would be tagged in the\nInline XBRL structured data language. The provision requiring Inline XBRL tagging of climate-\nrelated disclosures would benefit investors by making those disclosures more readily available\nfor aggregation, comparison, filtering, and other enhanced analytical methods.903 These benefits\nare expected to reduce search costs and substantially improve investors\u2019 information-processing\nefficiency.904 XBRL requirements for public company financial statement disclosures have been\nobserved to reduce information-processing costs, thereby decreasing information asymmetry and\nincreasing transparency by incorporating more company-specific information into the financial\nmarkets.905 In addition, the proposed Inline XBRL requirement for the climate-related\ndisclosures may further limit agency problems, as XBRL requirements for financial statement\n903 For example, structuring climate-related disclosures would enable more advanced analyses than those described\nin the aforementioned Commission staff review that used keyword searches and NLP. See supra IV.A.5.a.\n904 The findings on XBRL cited in the following paragraphs are not necessarily focused on climate-related\ndisclosures and metrics, but we expect the findings to be generally applicable and to result in similar benefits\nfor investors.\n905 See, e.g., Y.

Direct\ncosts would include compliance burdens for registrants in their efforts to meet the new disclosure\nrequirements. These direct costs could potentially be significant; however, the incremental costs\nwould be lower to the extent that registrants already provide the required disclosures. Indirect\ncosts may include heightened litigation risk and the potential disclosure of proprietary\ninformation.910 We proceed by discussing these various costs.\na. Direct costs\nThe primary direct costs that the proposed rules would impose on registrants are\ncompliance costs.

These costs are commonly referred to as \u201cproprietary costs.\u201d\n371\n\nconduct climate-related risk assessments, collect information or data, measure emissions (or,\nwith respect to Scope 3 emissions, gather data from relevant upstream and downstream entities),\nintegrate new software or reporting systems, seek legal counsel, and obtain assurance on\napplicable disclosures (i.e., Scopes 1 and 2 emissions). In addition, even if a registrant already\ngathers and reports the required information, some or all of this information may be in locations\noutside of SEC filings (such as sustainability reports posted on company websites or emissions\ndata reported to the EPA). These registrants may face lower incremental costs by virtue of\nalready having the necessary processes and systems in place to generate such disclosures;\nhowever they may still incur some additional costs associated with preparing this information for\ninclusion in SEC filings.\n(1) General cost estimates\nIn this section, we review sources that provide insight into the magnitude of the potential\ncosts associated with the proposed rules. With some exceptions discussed in further detail, these\nsources provide information at the level of general costs for climate disclosures. We\nacknowledge that these sources are limited in scope or representativeness and thus may not\ndirectly reflect registrants\u2019 compliance costs. For instance, some third-party sources may present\ncost estimates that do not include all items required under the proposed rules (e.g., assurance\ncosts), or else they may aggregate the costs of multiple items (including those not required under\nthe proposed rules) into a single cost figure. However, these sources may serve as useful\nreferences to the extent that they overlap with specific disclosure elements required in the\nproposed rules. For example, third-party cost estimates of preparing TCFD reports or completing\nthe CDP questionnaire can offer a rough approximation of potential compliance costs due to their\n372\n\nsimilarity with the proposed rules. Below, we request further data to assist us in estimating\npotential costs.\nAs discussed in Section V, for purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995\n(\u201cPRA\u201d),911 we estimate the annual costs over the first six years of compliance with the proposed\nrules.912 For non-SRC registrants, the costs in the first year of compliance are estimated to be\n$640,000 ($180,000 for internal costs and $460,000 for outside professional costs), while annual\ncosts in subsequent years are estimated to be $530,000 ($150,000 for internal costs and $380,000\nfor outside professional costs). For SRC registrants, the costs in the first year of compliance are\nestimated to be $490,000 ($140,000 for internal costs and $350,000 for outside professional\ncosts), while annual costs in subsequent years are estimated to be $420,000 ($120,000 for\ninternal costs and $300,000 for outside professional costs). These costs are expected to decrease\nover time for various reasons, including increased institutional knowledge, operational\nefficiency, and competition within the market for relevant services.\nOne commenter provided cost estimates for their services in assisting client companies\nprepare TCFD-aligned disclosures.913 For companies that have no prior experience in GHG\nanalysis or climate-related disclosures, the commenter estimates initial costs to range from\n911 See Paperwork Reduction Act, Pub. L. No. 104-13, 109 Stat 163 (1995) (codified at 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.).\nSee infra Section V.\n912 The following estimates are applicable to registrants filing form 10-K that have no existing climate-related\ndisclosure processes or expertise. All estimates are rounded to the nearest $5,000.\n913 See memorandum, dated Feb. 4, 2022, concerning staff meeting with representatives of S&P Global.\n373\n\n$150,000 to $200,000 to prepare TCFD-aligned disclosures.914 Companies that have already\ncalculated their carbon footprints and only need assistance with TCFD reporting may expect\ncosts of $50,000 to $200,000, with the average cost of approximately $100,000. Ongoing costs\nfor their services are expected to be zero conditional upon the TCFD requirements remaining\nunchanged,915 however the reporting company may still incur internal costs in preparing these\ndisclosures on an annual basis.\nAnother source presents survey results of climate-related disclosure costs for three\nunnamed companies, which consist of a European-based multinational large-cap financial\ninstitution, a US-based large-cap industrial manufacturing company, and a US-based mid-cap\nwaste management company.916 The survey reports that each firm has \u201calready established\nrobust in-house climate disclosure systems that can easily be leveraged to comply with any new\ndisclosure rule,\u201d as evidenced by their concurrent reporting under multiple climate disclosure\nframeworks (e.g., TCFD, CDP, SASB, GRI, etc.). The respondents indicate that anticipated\nincremental costs of a mandatory climate disclosure rule are therefore expected to be minimal.917\n914 This cost range pertains to clients\u2019 use of the commenter\u2019s \u201cTCFD Suite\u201d, which consists of the following\nmodules: benchmarking / gap assessment, management interviews, physical risk assessment, and various\ntransition risk assessments, including policy risk analysis, market risk assessment, technology risk assessment,\nand reputation risk assessment. This cost range excludes the cost of additional services, such as target-setting\n($20,000 to $30,000) and calculating GHG footprints ($75,000 to $125,000 for Scopes 1, 2, and 3), the latter of\nwhich is discussed in further detail in the following subsection.\n915 The commenter reports that should the TCFD requirements change based on new science, projections, and\nbusiness changes, costs of the TCFD Suite in future years may range from $125,000 to $175,000.\n916 See L. Reiners and K.

The respondents acknowledge that actual incremental costs would depend on the contents of\nthe final rule.\n374\n\nAll respondents disclose Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions, while none of them obtain third-party\nassurance for their climate-related disclosures.\nThe mid-cap waste management company estimates that the cost of producing their first\nTCFD report was less than $10,000. The company\u2019s reported annual costs consist of employee\ncosts ($12,600)918 and third-party costs ($60,000 to $160,000).919 However, the reported annual\ncosts may be less applicable to potential compliance costs as they combine additional costs\nassociated with several other activities not necessarily required in the proposed rules, including\nits adherence to multiple climate disclosure frameworks (e.g. TCFD, GRI, SASB, and CDP) and\ndesigning its annual sustainability report and associated webpage.920 Overall, the company\nreports that its total costs related to producing climate-related disclosures across these multiple\nframeworks are less than 5% of its total SEC compliance-related costs.\nThe large-cap industrial manufacturing company reports that the costs of preparing its\nfirst CDP questionnaire was no more than $50,000. Additionally, the combined costs of\nproducing its first TCFD, SASB, and GRI disclosures were between $200,000 and $350,000.\nReported annual costs include internal costs (between $200,000 and $350,000)921 and the cost for\n918 The company allocates three employees to produce climate-related disclosures. Two employees in Legal and\nCompliance devote a combined 80 hours per year on this task, while one employee in Management and\nAdministration devotes two hours per year.\n919 The company reports that approximately one-third of these third-party costs is associated with designing the\nannual sustainability report and associated webpage, while the remaining two-thirds is associated with report\nwriting and consulting work on the voluntary frameworks.\n920 These annual costs reflect a larger scope of climate-related disclosures (e.g. multiple frameworks, sustainability\nreport, etc.) relative to the initial cost, which is specific to TCFD reporting only. Nevertheless, because these\nestimates aggregate the costs of reporting under the TCFD in addition to other climate disclosure framework,\nthese estimates can serve as an upper bound of what annual costs may be specific to TCFD reporting only.\n921 Internal costs include the cost of approximately 20 employees working part-time on climate-related disclosures\nfrom Nov. until Mar. and one full-time consultant.\n375\n\nauditors and consultants ($400,000).922 These cost estimates, however, may overestimate\npotential compliance costs to the extent that they include disclosure items or activities not\nrequired in the proposed rules. The company reports that their annual costs of producing its\nvoluntary climate-related disclosures are less than 0.1% of their revenues.\nThe multinational financial institution reports that the cost of producing its first TCFD\nreport, SASB report, and CDP questionnaire were each less than $100,000 given that such\ninformation overlaps with what the company already discloses under the EU\u2019s Prospectus\nRegulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/1129). The company estimates annual costs ranging from\n$250,000 and $500,000 to produce these disclosures, but as before, this range may combine the\ncosts of activities that are not required in the proposed rules.923 Similar to the industrial\nmanufacturing company, this company also notes that the annual costs of producing its voluntary\nclimate-related disclosures are less than 0.1% of their revenues.\nSome commenters also provided estimates of climate-related disclosure costs for\nindividual firms. One commenter provided a breakdown of such costs for seven unnamed large\ncap firms across six different industries.924 Headcount requirements ranged from two to 20 full-\ntime equivalent employees. One large-cap firm in the energy industry reported that its TCFD\nreporting process involved 40 employees and six months of nearly full-time participation by 20\ncore team members. Employee hours spent on climate reporting ranged from 7,500 to 10,000\nannually. Fees for external advisory services ranged from $50,000 to $1.35 million annually,\n922 Auditors review data quality and data collection procedures, while consultants help prepare substantive\ndisclosures, advise on adherence to the voluntary climate disclosure frameworks, and prepare web updates.\n923 The company notes that the bulk of its annual costs comes from producing chapter 7 of its Universal\nRegistration Document, issued under the EU\u2019s Prospectus Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/1129). Chapter 7\npertains to the extra-financial performance statement of the consolidated firm.\n924 See Letter from Society for Corporate Governance (June 11, 2021).\n376\n\nwhich generally included legal counsel and consulting services related to environmental\nengineering, emissions, climate science, modeling, or sustainability reporting. Another\ncommenter, a Fortune 500 energy infrastructure firm, reported that it employs a full-time,\nmanagement level director that spends about 25% of his time developing sustainability reports\nand other ESG initiatives. This commenter also reported that it pays a third-party consulting firm\nmore than $250,000 annually to assist in its ESG and sustainability report process.925\nThe UK\u2019s Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, as part of its Green\nFinance Strategy, has released a final stage impact assessment (the \u201cUK impact assessment\u201d) of\ntheir proposed rules that would also require certain TCFD-aligned disclosures from firms and\nasset managers listed on UK financial markets.926 The UK impact assessment provides a\nbreakdown of estimated average compliance costs per affected entity. Under the assumption that\naffected entities have no pre-existing climate-related disclosure practices or expertise, the UK\nimpact assessment estimates that first-year one-time costs would include familiarization costs\n($17,300927 plus $2,600 per subsidiary, as applicable) and legal review ($4,400). They also\n925 See Letter from Williams Companies, Inc. (June 12, 2021).\n926 See U.K. Dep\u2019t for Bus., Energy, & Indus.

In total, the study estimates that a company with\nno pre-existing climate-related disclosure practices or expertise could incur costs of $201,800 in\nthe first year and $177,900 in subsequent years, plus additional costs due to subsidiaries, as\napplicable. This cost estimation methodology is conditional upon assumptions regarding the\nnumber of required staff, the rank or title of the staff, and the required labor hours, which are\nthen matched with local wage data to estimate final costs.\nIt is important to note that all of these cost estimates are conditional on specific\nassumptions and can vary significantly depending on firm characteristics, such as firm size,\nindustry, business model, the complexity of the firm\u2019s corporate structure, starting level of\ninternal expertise, etc. In addition, we note that, in certain cases, these cost estimates may\nrepresent a registrant\u2019s optimal response to investor demand, and thus may exceed the minimum\ncost necessary to fulfill mandatory reporting of climate-related risks. We are accordingly\nrequesting comments regarding compliance costs, including cost data that can be used to\n928 This number excludes the cost of scenario analysis since this is not required under the proposed rules.\n929 We note that these numbers do not include the costs of measuring and reporting Scope 3 emissions since this is\nnot required under the UK proposed rules.\n930 These numbers have been converted from GBP based on the 2021 average exchange rate of $1.3757 USD/GBP,\nrounded to the nearest $100. We note that the impact assessment also provides estimates of incremental costs\nassociated with each subsidiary; however, these costs are not included in the estimates cited above for the sake\nof brevity. Signposting costs refer to the \u201cadditional annual cost to those in scope to upload the required\nreporting documentation and signposting to this documentation within their annual report.\u201d\n378\n\ngenerate more accurate, granular, and reliable cost estimates that are more representative of the\nfull set of affected registrants.\n(2) Cost estimates specific to emissions\nIn this section, we review the available evidence, which provides some insight into the\nscope of the compliance costs associated with reporting GHG emissions. We are cognizant of the\ntype of costs that registrants will incur to report GHG emissions, e.g. resources, systems, design\nand implementation of DCP, external consulting services. In light of the limited information\navailable, however, we are unable to fully and accurately quantify these costs. Accordingly, we\nare requesting comments regarding cost data for GHG emissions reporting.\nOne commenter reports that their services in calculating client companies\u2019 GHG\nfootprints (Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions) would initially cost $75,000 to $125,000 if the client\ncompany has no prior experience in this area.931 Ongoing costs amount to approximately $40,000\nassuming no material changes in Scope 3 emissions (i.e., assess Scopes 1 and 2 only). If there are\nmaterial changes to Scope 3 emissions, ongoing costs would range from $75,000 to $125,000\n(i.e., assess Scopes 1, 2, and 3).\nAnother commenter, a climate management and accounting platform, provided cost\nestimates of the measurement and reporting of emissions. This commenter\u2019s estimates are\ndisaggregated across scopes of emissions as well as \u201clow maturity\u201d vs \u201chigh maturity\u201d\ncompanies with respect to emissions reporting. Low maturity companies are defined as those that\nhave no formal understanding of GHG emission calculations and have no related policies or\nprograms in place. Accordingly, these companies have not organized or collected any data for\n931 See supra note 783. Legal and audit fees are not included in these cost estimates.\n379\n\nsuch a calculation. High maturity companies are defined as those that have the aforementioned\nunderstanding, policies, programs, and data. Therefore, high maturity companies are expected to\nface lower incremental costs. The commenter estimates that the average first-year startup cost of\nassessing Scopes 1 and 2 emissions amount to $45,000 and $25,000 for companies of low and\nhigh maturity, respectively. Including the assessment of Scope 3 emissions would increase the\ncosts by $80,000 and $25,000 for companies of low and high maturity, respectively. The\ncommenter indicated that it expects these costs to decrease over time as software solutions\nsimplify the process and reduce the burden on companies.\nAdditional cost estimates are provided by another commenter, which is an organization\nthat assists companies, communities, and other organizations in accurately assessing emissions\ndata across all scopes of emissions.932 According to their pricing structure, initial one-time costs\namount to $10,000, which includes identifying data input needs, developing the design and\norganization of user interfaces, establishing software and IT systems, and reporting emissions\nfrom prior years to the extent that historic data is available. Ongoing costs, which includes a\nsubscription fee and data management fee, amount to $12,000 plus $1,200 per building that is\ncovered in the calculation of emissions. Another organization that offers similar services, among\nothers, indicates that their fees for GHG accounting for Scopes 1, 2, and 3 can range from\n$11,800 to $118,300.933 Their fees for applying the PCAF method on investment and lending\n932 See memorandum, dated Jan. 21, 2022, concerning staff meeting with representatives of Ledger8760, available\nat https://www-draft.sec.gov/comments/s7-10-22/s71022.htm.\n933 See memorandum, dated Jan. 14, 2022, concerning staff meeting with representatives of South Pole. These\nnumbers have been converted from EUR based on the 2021 average exchange rate of $1.183 USD/EUR,\nrounded to the nearest $100.\n380\n\nportfolios range from $11,800 to $35,500. They note that the assessment process take\napproximately 1-3 months depending on the complexity and availability of data.\nThe EPA has also sought to quantify the costs of measuring and reporting emissions in\naccordance with the mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which generally requires\nfacility-level reporting of emissions from large emitters and from large suppliers of certain\nproducts (e.g., entities that produce gasoline that will eventually be consumed downstream by the\nend-user).934 The EPA estimated that the rule would impose small expected costs on the facilities\nunder its purview. The EPA estimated that, for most sectors, the costs represent at most 0.1% of\nsales.935 For small entities,936 the EPA estimated that the costs are on average less than 0.5% of\nsales. While the EPA\u2019s emissions reporting requirements, as discussed above, may elicit some of\nthe information required under our proposed rules, given that the requirements are different, the\nactual compliance costs would differ accordingly.\nA survey conducted by PCAF provides some estimates of the costs of assessing financed\nemissions.937 Financed emissions, which can be one component of Scope 3 emissions for certain\nfinancial institutions, can be described as the emissions generated by companies in which a\nfinancial institution invests or to which it otherwise has exposure. The PCAF survey of 18\n934 See Section IV.A.3 for more information on the EPA mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program.\n935 See EPA, Regulatory Impact Analysis for the Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Sept. 2009),\navailable at https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2015-07/documents/regulatoryimpactanalysisghg.pdf. The\nEPA notes that several facility types do not currently report emissions (or the existence of such disclosure\npractices cannot be confirmed), therefore the cost estimates for these facility types reflect full start-up costs to\nmeet the reporting requirements.\n936 The EPA defines a small entity as (1) a small business, as defined by SBA\u2019s regulations at 13 CFR Part\n121.201; (2) a small governmental jurisdiction that is a government of a city, county, town, school district, or\nspecial district with a population of less than 50,000; or (3) a small organization that is any not-for-profit\nenterprise that is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.\n937 See Letter from PCAF (Dec. 21, 2021).\n381\n\nunnamed financial institutions938 found that typical staff time ranged between 50 and 100 days\nand the costs for contracting external support was less than $20,000 for the majority of\nrespondents. These estimates may provide some sense of the costs that may be incurred by those\nfinancial institutions that would be required to report Scope 3 emissions under the proposed\nrules.\n(3) Cost estimates of assurance for Scopes 1 and 2 emissions\ndisclosures\nRegistrants that are accelerated filers and large accelerated filers will incur additional\ncosts in obtaining assurance of Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosures. The Commission estimates\nthese costs starting with data on these filers\u2019 median audit fees in fiscal year 2020, which is\n$989,566 and $2,781,962 for accelerated filers and large accelerated filers, respectively.939 Next,\nan academic study suggests that assurance costs for sustainability reports (which serve as a\ncommon location for climate-related information, in addition to other non-financial topics) may\nrange from 5% to 10% of total audit fees.940 We take the minimum, median, and maximum\npercentages (5%, 7.5%, and 10%, respectively) and apply further adjustments based on (i)\nemissions disclosures typically compromising only a portion of CSR reports, (ii) the potential fee\npremium related to attestation report included in SEC filings, and (iii) the average pricing\ndifference between limited and reasonable assurance. For limited assurance, we estimate that\n938 The 18 survey respondents consist of 2 insurance companies, 13 banks (commercial, investment, or\ndevelopment), 1 asset owner, and 2 asset managers. Respondents\u2019 asset size ranges from less than a $1bn USD\nto $500bn USD. The average assets covered by this disclosure activity was approximately $5-20bn USD.\n939 Data on audit fees is from Audit Analytics, which provides all fee data disclosed by SEC registrants in\nelectronic filings since Jan. 1, 2000.\n940 See R.J. Casey and J.H. Grenier, Understanding and Contributing to the Enigma of Corporate Social\nResponsibility (CSR) Assurance in the United States, 97 AUDITING: A JOURNAL OF PRACTICE & THEORY 130\n(2015).\n382\n\naccelerated filers will incur costs ranging from $30,000 to $60,000 (with a median of $45,000),\nwhile large accelerated filers will incur costs ranging from $75,000 to $145,000 (with a median\nof $110,000). For reasonable assurance, we estimate that accelerated filers will incur costs\nranging from $50,000 to $100,000 (with a median of $75,000), while large accelerated filers will\nincur costs ranging from $115,000 to $235,000 (with a median of $175,000).\nOn the one hand, these estimates may underestimate actual costs as they are based on\nrelative costs of assurance for financial statements, and assurance on emissions may differ in\nimportant ways. On the other hand, the costs may be lower in the future to the extent that the\nmarket for assurance services matures with respect to institutional knowledge, procedural\nefficiency, and overall competition. We request additional data that may assist in accurately\nassessing the costs of obtaining assurance over emissions disclosures.\n(4) Factors that affect direct costs\nIncremental compliance costs may be relatively lower for registrants that already meet\nsome of the disclosure and tagging requirements. For instance, registrants that are currently\nsubject to the EPA\u2019s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program would face lower incremental costs in\nreporting certain scopes of emissions relative to a firm that has no emissions measurement\nsystems in place.941 Similarly, registrants that already provide extensive qualitative disclosures\non climate-related risks, which tend to be large accelerated filers and registrants in high emission\nindustries,942 may face lower incremental costs in meeting certain disclosure requirements. As\ndiscussed in Section IV.A.5.a, the Commission\u2019s staff reviewed 6,644 recent annual reports\n941 See Section IV.C.1.e for more information on how the proposed rules compare to the EPA\u2019s emissions reporting\nrequirements.\n942 See Section IV.A.5.a\n383\n\n(Forms 10-K, 40-F, and 20-F) and found that 33% of them contained disclosures related to\nclimate change, the majority of which discussed information related to business impact,\nemissions, international climate accords, and physical risks. Registrants with operations in\nforeign jurisdictions943 where disclosure requirements are based on the TCFD\u2019s framework for\nclimate-related financial reporting, would also face lower incremental costs.944 Moreover, costs\nmay also be mitigated by the proposed transition period, which would allow firms to more\ngradually transition to the new reporting regime.\nSeveral industry reports also document how a sizeable portion of U.S. companies report\nclimate-related information under one or more third-party frameworks that are either fully or\npartially aligned with the TCFD disclosure elements. For example, the CCMC survey (G&A\nstudy) reports that among their sample of U.S. public companies, 44% (53%) use the SASB,\n31% (52%) use the GRI, 29% (30%) use the TCFD, and 24% (40%) use the CDP. Moody\u2019s\nanalytics provides a detailed view for a sample of 659 U.S. companies of the existing disclosure\nrate across the different TCFD disclosure elements that range from a high of 45% disclosure rate\nfor Risks and Opportunities - Strategy (a), to a low of 5% for Risks and Opportunities - Strategy\n(c) (see Table 4). Since the proposed rules are broadly consistent with the TCFD framework, we\nwould expect lower incremental compliance costs for registrants that provide most or all\ndisclosures according to the TCFD or related frameworks, including the CDP, which has fully\nintegrated the TCFD disclosure elements into its disclosure questionnaire, and other frameworks\nand/or standards partly aligned with the TCFD recommendations.\n943 E.g., Morningstar reports that over 35% of S&P 500 revenues came from foreign markets, while this percentage\nis around 20% for the revenues coming from companies belonging to the Russell 2000 index. See,\nhttps://www.morningstar.com/articles/918437/your-us-equity-fund-is-more-global-than-you-think.\n944 See Section IV.A.4 for a discussion on International Disclosure Requirements.\n384\n\nSimilarly, registrants in the insurance industry may also face lower incremental costs due\nto their existing disclosure practices. As discussed in Section IV.A.3, a large subset of insurance\nfirms are required to disclose their climate-related risk assessment and strategy via the NAIC\nClimate Risk Disclosure Survey. A comment by a state insurance commissioner stated that\nbecause this survey overlaps extensively with the TCFD recommendations, these firms should be\nable to easily switch to reporting via the TCFD disclosure framework.945 This is because the\nproposed rules are broadly consistent with the TCFD. We expect that registrants in the insurance\nindustry may be able to adapt more easily to providing disclosure under these rules.\nSection IV.A.5.e reports survey evidence on the frequency with which firms obtain\nassurance in sustainability reports. This evidence suggests that a significant fraction of large\ncompanies already obtain some form, albeit limited, of assurance. To the extent that large\naccelerated filers and accelerated filers already voluntarily obtain some form of assurance over\ntheir GHG emissions, these registrants would face lower incremental costs associated with\ncomplying with the proposed rules\u2019 assurance requirements. These registrants tend to bear\nproportionately lower compliance costs than smaller issuers due to the fixed cost components of\nsuch compliance.946 Additionally, as the market for assurance matures, the Commission staff\nexpects these costs to decrease over time.\nIncremental costs may be higher for smaller firms considering that they are less likely to\nhave climate-related disclosure systems and processes already in place.947 If smaller firms were\n945 See Letter from Mike Kreidler, Office of the Insurance Commissioner, State of Washington (June 14, 2021).\n946 For example, during fiscal year 2020, median audit fees as percentage of revenue for large accelerated filers and\naccelerated filers was 0.16%, while the corresponding figure for non-accelerated filers was 1.1%.\n947 See supra note 760. See also discussion of the Commission staff\u2019s review using climate-related keyword\nsearches in Section IV.A.5.a.\n385\n\nto face higher proportional fixed costs in meeting the disclosure requirements, this may\npotentially put them at a competitive disadvantage to larger firms. 948 Conversely, incremental\ncosts for smaller firms may be lower to the extent that they have less complexity with respect to\ntheir assets and operations, which may allow them to assess climate-risk exposures or measure\nemissions at lower cost.\nWith respect to the Inline XBRL tagging requirements, various preparation solutions\nhave been developed and used by operating companies to fulfill their structuring requirements,\nand some evidence suggests that, for smaller companies, XBRL compliance costs have decreased\nover time.949 The incremental compliance costs associated with Inline XBRL tagging of climate-\nrelated disclosures would also be mitigated by the fact that filers that would be subject to the\nproposed requirements would also be subject to other Inline XBRL requirements for other\ndisclosures in Commission filings, including financial statement and cover page disclosures in\n948 Because higher proportional fixed costs for smaller firms may be particularly acute with respect to assessing\nScope 3 emissions, the proposed rules exempt SRCs from providing Scope 3 emissions disclosures. Since SRCs\nare a small fraction of the market, the overall benefit to investors would not be as large as for non-SRCs, while\navoiding high fixed costs that could put them at a potential competitive disadvantage.\n949 An AICPA survey of 1,032 reporting companies with $75 million or less in market capitalization in 2018 found\nan average cost of $5,850 per year, a median cost of $2,500 per year, and a maximum cost of $51,500 per year\nfor fully outsourced XBRL creation and filing, representing a 45% decline in average cost and a 69% decline in\nmedian cost since 2014. See M. Cohn, AICPA Sees 45% Drop in XBRL Costs for Small Companies, Accounting\nToday (Aug. 15, 2018) (stating that a 2018 NASDAQ survey of 151 listed registrants found an average XBRL\ncompliance cost of $20,000 per quarter, a median XBRL compliance cost of $7,500 per quarter, and a\nmaximum, XBRL compliance cost of $350,000 per quarter in XBRL costs per quarter), available at\nhttps://www.accountingtoday.com/news/aicpa-sees-45-drop-in-xbrl-costs-for-small-reporting-companies\n(retrieved from Factiva database).

Reg.\n65601 (Dec. 21, 2018).\n386\n\ncertain periodic reports and registration statements.950 As such, the proposal would not impose\nInline XBRL compliance requirements on filers that would otherwise not be subject to such\nrequirements, and filers may be able to leverage existing Inline XBRL preparation processes\nand/or expertise in complying with the proposed climate-related disclosure tagging requirements.\nWe expect that the number of registrants committed to preparing climate-related\ndisclosures will increase in the future, independently from our proposed rules. As discussed in\nSection IV.B.1, a sizeable and growing portion of global investors consider climate change as the\nleading issue driving their engagements with companies and is demanding robust disclosure\naround its impacts and the plan to mitigate climate-related risks. Consistent with this increasing\ndemand for climate-related information, recent trends showed an uptick in climate-related\ndisclosures, particularly within samples of larger firms, though not necessarily through their\nregulatory filings.951 Furthermore, the market for related services (e.g., GHG accounting\nservices, auditors, and other consultants, etc.) may become more competitive, driving down\ncosts. To the extent that these trends continue in the future, we would expect that the incremental\ncosts for complying with the proposed rules would become lower for an increasing number of\nfirms.\n950 See 17 CFR 229.601(b)(101); 17 CFR 232.405 (for requirements related to tagging financial statements\n(including footnotes and schedules) in Inline XBRL). See also 17 CFR 229.601(b)(104); 17 CFR 232.406 for\nrequirements related to tagging cover page disclosures in Inline XBRL. Beginning in 2024, filers of most fee-\nbearing forms will also be required to structure filing fee information in Inline XBRL, although the Commission\nwill provide an optional web tool that will allow filers to provide those tagged disclosures without the use of\nInline XBRL compliance services or software. See 17 CFR 229.601(b)(108) and 17 CFR 232.408; Filing Fee\nDisclosure and Payment Methods Modernization, Release No. 33-10997 (Oct. 13, 2021), 86 FR 70166 (Dec. 9,\n2021).\n951 See Section IV.A.5\n387\n\nb. Indirect costs\nIn addition to the direct costs of preparing climate-related disclosures, the proposed rules\ncould also lead to indirect costs. For example, the proposed rules may result in additional\nlitigation risk since the proposed climate-related disclosures may be new and unfamiliar to many\nregistrants.952 The proposed rules would significantly expand the type and amount of information\nregistrants are required to provide about climate-related risks. Registrants unfamiliar preparing\nthese disclosures may face significant uncertainty and novel compliance challenges. To the\nextent this leads to inadvertent non-compliance, registrants may face additional exposure to\nlitigation or enforcement action.\nHowever, certain factors may mitigate this concern. First, existing and proposed safe\nharbors953 would provide protection from liability for certain statements by registrants, including\nprojections regarding future impacts of climate-related risks on a registrant\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial statements and climate-related targets and goals. Second, the proposed rules would\ninclude phase-in periods after the effective date to provide registrants with sufficient time to\nbecome familiar with and meet the proposed disclosure requirements.954\n952 See supra note 840.\n953 As previously noted, registrants would be able to use the existing safe harbors for forward-looking statements\nthat were added to the Securities Act and Exchange Act pursuant to the PSLRA assuming all conditions of those\nsafe harbor provisions are met. See supra note 219.\n954 Compliance would be required in a registrant\u2019s fiscal year ending no earlier than two years after the effective\ndate of any adopted rules. An additional one year phase-in would be provided for registrants that are not large\naccelerated filers, while complying with Scope 3 emissions reporting would also be provided with an additional\none year phase-in.\n388\n\nAnother potential indirect cost is the possibility that certain provisions of the proposed\nrules may force registrants to disclose proprietary information.955 Under the proposed rules,\nregistrants would be required to disclose a wide range of climate-related information, including\npotential impacts on its business operations or production processes, types and locations of its\noperations, products or services, supply chain and/or value chain. Registrants would be further\nrequired to disclose whether they have emissions-related targets and metrics or an internal\ncarbon price, and if they do, what they are. To the extent that a registrant\u2019s business model or\nstrategy relies on the confidentiality of such information, the required disclosures may put the\nregistrant at a competitive disadvantage.\nc. Other cost considerations\nAlthough the proposed rules may impose significant compliance costs, we expect these\ncosts to decrease over time, both from firm-specific and market-wide contexts. From the firm-\nspecific context, registrant disclosing climate-related information for the first time is likely to\nincur initial fixed costs to develop and implement the necessary processes and controls.956 Once\nthe firm invests in the institutional knowledge and systems to prepare the disclosures, the\nprocedural efficiency of these processes and controls should subsequently improve, leading to\nlower costs in following years.957\n955 Proprietary costs are generally relevant for reporting that involves information about a firms\u2019 business\noperations or production processes and disclosures that are specific, detailed and process-oriented. See, e.g., C.\nLeuz, A. Triantis, and T. Y. Wang, Why Do Firms Go Dark? Causes and Economic Consequences of Voluntary\nSEC Deregistrations, 45(2) JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING AND ECONOMICS 181-208 (2008); D.A. Bens, P. G.\nBerger, and S. J. Monahan, Discretionary Disclosure in Financial Reporting: An Examination Comparing\nInternal Firm Data to Externally Reported Segment Data, 86 (2) THE ACCOUNTING REVIEW 417-449 (2011).\n956 See Letter from Financial Executives International\u2019s (FEI) Committee on Corporate Reporting (CCR) (June 10,\n2021).\n957 The assumption that first year\u2019s costs are greater than subsequent years\u2019 is consistent with the cost estimation\nmodels of the EPA\u2019s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program and the UK\u2019s proposal of mandatory TCFD-aligned\ndisclosure.\n389\n\nEstablishing a framework for standardized climate-related disclosures could also reduce\nuncertainty for registrants over the specific content to disclose and could mitigate disclosure\nburdens to the extent that it reduces information requests from third parties. Before registrants\ncan take any tangible steps toward preparing climate-related disclosures, they must first\ndetermine which specific climate-related discussions, metrics, and analyses are most appropriate\nto disclose \u2013 a process that, under the current regime, can involve significant uncertainty.\nFurthermore, the uncertain, complex, and multidimensional nature unique to climate-related\nrisks, combined with the unpredictability of investor responses to such disclosures,958 can also\nmake it costly for management to determine the risks which meet the materiality threshold.\nBy implementing a standardized climate disclosure framework, the proposed rules could\npotentially reduce the burden that registrants may face in the environment of diverging voluntary\nframeworks and help clarify for registrants what they should disclose, where and when to make\ntheir disclosures, and what structure or methodology to use.959 While a more principles-based\napproach would provide additional flexibility for registrants, it also may impose certain costs if\nthey are unsure of what climate-related measures are needed to satisfy legal requirements. Such\nan approach could entail additional judgment on the part of management, or result in registrants\nerring on the side of caution in complex matters such as climate-related disclosures. This could\nultimately translate into spending more resources to determine appropriate compliance with the\nCommission\u2019s applicable reporting standards. The proposed rules should provide legal certainty\naround climate-related disclosure and therefore mitigate the compliance burdens associated with\nthe existing regulatory framework.\n958 See Section IV.B.2.a.(4)\n959 See supra note 806.\n390\n\nFurthermore, some registrants currently receive multiple, diverse requests for climate-\nrelated information from different parties, such as investors, asset managers, and data service\nproviders. Responding to such third-party request can be costly and inefficient960 and may put\nsignificant and sometimes competing demands on registrants.961 A standardized climate\ndisclosure framework could potentially reduce information requests from third parties to the\nextent that such requests overlap with the disclosures required under the proposed rules. We\nacknowledge, however, that registrants that currently use third-party frameworks to disclose\nclimate-related information may incur certain costs of switching from their existing practice to\nour proposed disclosure framework.\nFrom a market-wide context, mandated climate disclosures may heighten demand for\ncertain data or third-party services related to preparing the required disclosures, including\nassistance with the reporting of emissions data. In the short term, there could be a potential\nincrease in the prices of such services to extent that the initial growth in demand exceeds the\nsupply. In the long term, however, this heightened demand is expected to spur competition,\ninnovation, and other economies of scale that could over time lower associated costs for such\nservices and data and improve their availability. Moreover, the aggregate accumulation of\ninstitutional knowledge may lead to a broad convergence of disclosure-related best practices,\nwhich could further reduce the costs of the proposed disclosures. .\nOverall, the market effects deriving from competition and innovation could enhance the\nefficiency and availability of relevant data and services, thereby lowering costs.

Anticipated Effects on Efficiency, Competition, and Capital Formation\n1. Efficiency\nAs discussed in Section IV.B.2, the complexity, uncertainty, and long-term nature of\nclimate risks make it unlikely that voluntary disclosure of such risks would be fully revealing.\nTherefore, as detailed in Section IV.C.1, mandating that climate-related disclosures be presented\nin a comparable and consistent manner and in a machine-readable language (Inline XBRL) is\nlikely to enhance the information environment for investors. In doing so, the proposed rules are\nexpected to improve market efficiency and price discovery by enabling climate-related\ninformation to be more fully incorporated into asset prices. Improved efficiency could inform the\nflow of capital and allow climate-related risks to be borne by those who are most willing and\nable to bear them.963\nThese expected improvements in market efficiency are broadly consistent with empirical\nresearch. If climate-related information is relevant for asset prices, and therefore market\nefficiency, then the effective disclosure of climate-related information would be expected to\ncause differential asset price/financing cost responses across firms and settings. Empirical\n962 See supra note 840.\n963 A recent study by McKinsey found that 85% of investors either agreed or strongly agreed that \u201cmore\nstandardization of sustainability reporting\u201d would help them allocate capital more effectively, and 83% either\nagreed or strongly agreed that it would help them manage risk more effectively. See Sara Bernow et. al., More\nThan Values: The Value-Based Sustainability Reporting That Investors Want, MCKINSEY & COMPANY (Aug. 7,\n2019), available at\nhttps://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Business%20Functions/Sustainability/Our%20Insights/More%2\n0than%20values%20The%20value%20based%20sustainability%20reporting%20that%20investors%20want/Mo\nre%20than%20values-VF.pdf.\n392\n\nevidence is largely consistent with this expectation. Academic studies have found evidence that\namong firms that voluntarily report emissions via the CDP questionnaire, those with higher\nemissions (relative to their size and industry peers) pay higher loan spreads.964 A recent report\nfrom Lazard Ltd. also found a significant relationship between carbon dioxide emissions and a\ncompany\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio.965 Even in settings with mandatory disclosure, evidence is\nconsistent with abnormally positive stock returns on announcement date for low-emitters and\nnegative returns for high-emitters.966\nWhile the disclosure of climate-related information can improve market efficiency,\ninvestor response to such disclosures can vary depending on specific circumstances, thereby\nhighlighting the limitations of the aforementioned studies.967 For example, if increased disclosure\ncauses investors to realize that their portfolios are more exposed to climate risk than previously\nknown, valuations may fall and costs of capital may increase as investors reallocate capital to\nbalance this risk. Further, aggregate pricing effects could also be due to a better understanding of\n964 See S. Kleimeier, and M. Viehs, Carbon Disclosure, Emission Levels, and the Cost of Debt, Emission Levels,\nand the Cost of Debt, SSRN (2018), available at https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2719665.\n965 See Lazard Climate Center (2021), available at https://www.lazard.com/media/451920/lazard-climate-center-\npresentation-december-2021.pdf. The report examined more than 16,000 companies from 2016 through 2020\nand found that investors are actively and directly pricing some transition risk into valuations, however the\neffects vary significantly across different types of GHGs, market cap, and sectors. Large cap companies (>$50\nbillion) experience greater valuation discounts, while big emitters, such as energy companies, showed the\nstarkest correlation. On average, a 10% decrease in a large U.S. energy company\u2019s emissions corresponded with\na 3.9% increase in its price-to-earnings ratio.\n966 See supra note 849 (Jouvenout and Kruger, 2021).\n967 Id. See also J. Grewal, E. J. Riedl, and G. Serafeim, Market Reaction to Mandatory Nonfinancial Disclosure, 65\n(7) Management Science 3061-3084 (2019); See supra note 849 (Bolton and Kacperczyk, 2020). The first paper\nin particular finds a negative aggregate stock market response to the passage of a mandatory ESG disclosure\nrules in the EU. These results, however, should be interpreted with caution. For one, the empirical design is\nbased on matching, but there are reasons to believe that the treatment and control groups differ along important\ndimensions. Further, there is no event study plot, and results are not shown for cumulative abnormal returns\nafter controlling for common risk factors like the Fama-French 3-factor model. It is therefore difficult to discern\nwhether the passage of the disclosure rules is actually driving the aggregate market response.\n393\n\nfuture regulatory risks firms face.968 Studies find, however, that cumulative abnormal stock\nreturns around the announcement date are negatively correlated with firms\u2019 mandatorily\ndisclosed emission levels. This consistent with mandatory reporting of climate-related\ninformation improving price discovery and market efficiency.\nEmpirical research has also documented evidence of market inefficiencies with respect to\nclimate-related risks. For example, one study finds that stock prices of food companies (i.e. food\nprocessing and agricultural companies) may exhibit mispricing with respect to drought\nexposure.969 The study documents that drought-exposed firms report reduced future profitability,\nindicating that drought exposure is a financial risk. In an efficient market, this risk should result\nin trading activity that decreases the current stock price and increases the expected return (to\ncompensate investors for bearing this risk). The study, however, finds that drought-exposed\nfirms deliver lower future returns relative to firms with less exposure, suggesting that the market\ninitially under-reacts to drought exposure. In other words, the market may fail to sufficiently\nincorporate the risk of drought exposure into the current stock price, resulting in investors\nholding mispriced assets and bearing risk for which they are not appropriately compensated.\nAnother study finds, through similar reasoning, that stock prices may exhibit mispricing with\nrespect to temperature changes induced by climate change.970 According to survey evidence of\nglobal institutional investors, respondents believe that equity valuations do not fully reflect\n968 For example, the passage of disclosure rules may signal more stringent enforcement of emissions rules going\nforward, leading to an increase in the risk of regulation. Therefore, it is difficult to disentangle the pure effect of\ndisclosure rules on stock performance and the cost of capital.\n969 See H. Hong, F.W. Li, J. Xu.

The discounted cash flow model\nillustrates how, all else equal, a drop in the cost of capital leads to a boost in equity valuation,\nwhich can further benefit investors.\nThere are also important efficiency implications in relation to systemic risks.973 The\nincreasing frequency and severity of climate events can potentially lead to destabilizing losses\nfor insurance companies,974 banks,975 and other financial intermediaries with direct and indirect\n971 See P.

In a financial context, systematic risk denotes the risk of a cascading failure in the financial sector, caused\nby linkages within the financial system, resulting in a severe economic downturn.\n974 See Facts + Statistics: Global Catastrophes, INSURANCE INFORMATION INSTITUTE, available at\nhttps://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-global-catastrophes.\n975 The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) recently requested feedback on draft principles designed\nto support the identification and management of climate-related financial risks at OCC-regulated institutions\nwith more than $100 billion in total consolidated assets.

Some commentators state that, in addition to\nphysical risks, the financial system could be destabilized also by potentially rapid and\nunexpected losses to carbon-intensive assets caused by a disorderly transition to a low-carbon\neconomy or a shift in the market\u2019s perception of climate risks.976 With insufficient and\ninconsistent disclosures, asset prices may not fully reflect climate-related risks. Consequently,\nmarket participants may inadvertently accumulate large exposures to such risks, leaving them\nvulnerable to considerable unexpected and potentially sudden losses. 977\nIn the face of such losses, financial intermediaries may be forced to sell off assets at fire-\nsale prices to generate enough cash to pay claims or to otherwise meet the time-sensitive cash\ndemands of creditors and counterparties. This fire-sale dynamic could push down asset prices as\nwell as the value of firms holding similar assets due to mark-to-market losses, potentially\nincreasing risk premia and correlations across asset classes.978 Stress from large, complex, and\ninterconnected financial institutions, or correlated stress across smaller market participants, could\nbe transmitted and propagate through the financial system,979 causing disruptions in the provision\n976 Gregg Gelzinis and Graham Steele, Climate Change Threatens the Stability of the Financial System, CENTER\nFOR AMERICAN PROGRESS (Nov. 21, 2019, 12:01 a.m.), available at\nhttps://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/reports/2019/11/21/477190/climate-change-threatens-\nstability-financial-system.\n977 See The Availability Of Data with Which to Monitor and Assess Climate-Related Risks to Financial Stability,\nThe Financial Stability Board (\u201cFSB\u201d) (July 7, 2021) (stating that the availability of data with which to monitor\nand assess climate-related risks to financial stability), available at https://www.fsb.org/2021/07/the-availability-\nof-data-with-which-to-monitor-and-assess-climate-related-risks-to-financial-stability/.\n978 The Implications of Climate Change for Financial Stability, FSB, available at https://www.iii.org/fact-\nstatistic/facts-statistics-global-catastrophes (2021).\n979 Physical risks can have immediate and direct effects on asset values, but they also present long-term indirect\nrisks. By damaging assets that serve as collateral for loans or that underpin other investments, reducing property\nvalues, increasing insurance premiums or decreasing insurance coverage, diminishing agricultural capacity, and\ncausing labor forces to migrate, the physical consequences of climate change could have profound and long\nterm effects on financial markets more generally.

The placement\nof climate-related information in SEC filings with machine-readable data language (Inline\nXBRL), rather than external reports or company websites, should also make it easier for\ninvestors to find and compare this information.\nOverall, we expect that by standardizing reporting practices, the proposed rules would\nlevel the playing field among firms, making it easier for investors to assess the climate-related\nrisks of a registrant against those of its competitors. The effects of peer benchmarking can\ncontribute to increased competition for companies in search for capital both across and within\nindustries, whereby firms can be more easily assessed and compared by investors against\nalternative options.\nFailure to implement the proposed rules could lead to an informational gap between U.S.\nregistrants and companies operating in foreign jurisdictions which require climate-related\ndisclosures. For example, such a gap may increase investors\u2019 uncertainty when assessing\nclimate-related risks of U.S. registrants vis-\u00e0-vis foreign competitors and place U.S. registrants at\na competitive disadvantage, with the potential to deter investments and hence increase U.S.\nregistrants\u2019 cost of capital.

Verrecchia, The Economic Consequences of\nIncreased Disclosure, 38 J. Acct. Res. 91 (2000). Several studies provide both theoretical and empirical\nevidence of the link between information asymmetry and cost of capital. See, e.g., T.E. Copeland and D.

In the second case, less information asymmetry between firms\nand their investors could allow investors to better estimate future cash flows, which could reduce\ninvestors\u2019 uncertainty, as well as the risk premium they demand, thus lowering the costs of\ncapital.986\nRecent studies provide some supporting empirical evidence of these effects within the\ncontext of ESG- or climate-related disclosure. These studies have found that, when firms\nvoluntarily provide material sustainability disclosures, they also experience improvements in\nliquidity (e.g. smaller bid-ask spreads).987 In addition, firms that choose to disclose emissions\nhave lower costs of equity and loan spreads.988 While firms\u2019 decisions about whether and when\nto disclose emissions data may be correlated with other factors as well asset prices/financing\ncosts, this would be consistent with such disclosures reducing the costs of capital for firms (to\nthe extent that some of these effects are driven by the disclosures themselves).\n985 See R.E.

    "text": "E. Other Economic Effects\nThe proposed rules may have some effects on firm behavior. Prior empirical evidence\nsupports the notion that, in response to mandatory ESG-related disclosure rules, firms tend to\nreport actions that appear more \u201cfavorable\u201d with respect to the corresponding disclosures. These\ndecisions would be made by a firm\u2019s management with the goal of maximizing firm value in\nresponse to the new disclosure mandate. To the extent that these actions reduce firms\u2019 exposures\nto physical and transition risks, this could lower the return that investors require for investing in\nthese firms, hence facilitating capital formation. This could reduce volatility of stock returns due\nto enhanced resiliency against such risks.\nEmpirical evidence shows that mandatory reporting of GHG emissions results in reduced\naggregate reported emissions among affected firms.989 Academic research shows that mandatory\nESG-related disclosure often contributes, not only to increased monitoring by investors or other\nstakeholders, but also to enhanced peer benchmarking by firms as they can more easily compare\nthemselves with their competitors.990 These changes may reflect market responses by companies\nand investors to the newly disclosed information. Accordingly, registrants may change their\nbehavior in response to the proposed disclosure requirements by reducing exposures to certain\nphysical or transition risks. However, this could also come with the potential cost of lower\nproductivity, profitability, or market share in the short-term.\n989 See B. Downar, J. Ernstberger, S. Reichelstein, S. Schwenen, and A. Zaklan, The Impact of Carbon Disclosure\nMandates on Emissions and Financial Operating Performance, REVIEW OF ACCOUNTING STUDIES 1-39 (2021);\nS. Tomar, Greenhouse Gas Disclosure and Emissions Benchmarking (Working Paper) (2021), available at:\nhttps://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3448904; See supra note 849 (Jouvenout and Kruger,\n2021).\n990 See supra note 840.\n401\n\nRegistrants might respond to the proposed disclosures by devoting more resources to\nclimate-related governance and risk management in an effort to address indirect effects on their\nbusiness arising from the disclosures. For example, the proposed rules require disclosure of\nmembers of the board or management that have prior climate expertise. Some registrants may\nrespond by giving more weight to climate expertise when searching for directors, which may\nlead them to deviate from the board composition that would have been in place absent the\nproposed rules. Similarly, the proposed rules would require disclosure on how climate-related\nrisks can impact registrants\u2019 consolidated financial statements, among others. Registrants may\nrespond by taking measures to minimize negative impacts in order to put forth more favorable\nmetrics. For example, registrants may move assets or operations away from geographic areas\nwith higher physical risk exposures or may seek to decrease GHG emissions.\nThe provision on GHG Emissions would also require scope 1, 2, and 3 (if material or the\nregistrant has a set a target or goal for scope 3) emission disclosures. These emission disclosures\nmay induce firms to use peer benchmarking to decide whether to investigate and reevaluate their\nenergy usage991 or otherwise reduce emissions based on anticipated market reactions to the\ndisclosed information. This process may provide certain registrants with incentives to search for\nalternative energy sources or find different suppliers, which could increase costs. Conversely, it\ncould also prompt certain firms to reduce nonessential activities and improve operational\nefficiency, which could lead to lower operating costs.\nThe provision requiring assurance of GHG Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosures would\nonly apply to accelerated filers. Non-accelerated filers would, instead, be required only to state\n991 See supra note 840.\n402\n\nwhether any of their GHG emissions disclosures were subject to third-party assurance, and if so,\nat what level. By asking all registrants, including non-accelerated filers, to disclose climate-\nrelated information within SEC filings, however, the proposed rules may motivate more non-\naccelerated filers to voluntarily seek assurance over these types of disclosures, than if the same\ninformation had been disclosed on companies\u2019 websites or sustainability reports. Certain non-\naccelerated filers may also voluntarily decide to attain assurance over their GHG emission\ndisclosures in order to enhance their reliability and prevent these disclosures from being\nperceived by investors as less reliable compared to those provided by accelerated filers.\nAs another example, the proposed rules would require the disclosure of the location (via\nZIP code) of firm assets or operations, which could allow investors to assess firms\u2019 exposures to\nphysical risk at a more granular level. This may allow investors to more easily diversify these\ngeographic-driven risks or expose themselves to such risks, if they choose to, more deliberately.\nThis may cause some firms to relocate assets or operations to geographical areas less exposed to\nphysical risks and/or give preferences to such areas for future business activity. It may also cause\nsome firms with higher geographic exposures to physical risks to alter overall operational risk\nand strategies.\nThe proposed rules might also affect the networks firms choose to operate in. For\nexample, a firm may choose to change some suppliers or disengage with certain clients due to\nthe effect that they may have on the firm\u2019s Scope 3 emissions. This may be particularly relevant\nfor certain financial institutions that are impacted by their portfolio firms\u2019 emissions or climate-\nrelated risks. These financial institutions may be less willing to extend credit to firms for which it\nis difficult to measure climate risk exposure information, potentially increasing the cost of capital\nfor these firms.\n403\n\nHowever, there are certain factors that may mitigate this effect. First, the proposed rules\nestablish a phase-in period, which is intended to give financial institutions and their prospective\nborrowers sufficient time to prepare the required disclosures. Second, analytical tools, data, and\nrelated methodologies (such as those related to measuring/reporting GHG emissions) are\ndeveloping rapidly and increasing in availability. Finally, frameworks like the PCAF to measure\nfinanced emissions would allow financial institutions to compute proxies for the emissions of\ntheir clients in a systematic and comparable manner even in the absence of actual emissions data.\nThe proposed rules could also cause some firms to pursue avoidance strategies. The\nprovision on Targets and Goals would require a registrant to disclose whether it has set any\nclimate-related targets or goals and the specific plans in place to achieve those objectives and\nmetrics to monitor progress. This may disincentivize certain firms from making such\ncommitments and providing the associated disclosures in SEC filings. Risk of litigation or\nenforcement actions, could result in registrants being more cautious in their decision to set\nclimate-related targets. Other firms, however, may find the existence of mandatory disclosures\naround climate-related targets and goals to be beneficial for signaling credible value-enhancing\ncommitments to investors. More credible and standardized disclosures on climate-related targets\nand goals could make registrants\u2019 communication more effective and facilitate investors\u2019\nunderstanding of related progress, hence providing additional incentives for making such\ncommitments.\nMore generally, if compliance costs with the proposed rules are high, this could influence\nthe marginal firm\u2019s decision to exit public markets or refrain from going public in the first place\nin order to circumvent the disclosure requirements. Firms may choose this strategy if they\nbelieve the potential compliance costs from the proposed rules outweigh the benefits of being\n404"

However, considering\nthat SRCs make up approximately 50% of registrants (and registrants that are not large\naccelerated filers make up approximately 70%), this alternative would also considerably\nundermine one of the primary objectives of the proposed rules, which is to achieve consistent,\ncomparable, and reliable disclosures of climate-related information.

It could also allow investors to proactively manage risk as they\nwould be better able to assess the range of potential threats and opportunities, evaluate different\nmanagement actions, and adapt accordingly. Furthermore, since some climate-related risks may\nonly manifest over longer horizons, scenario analysis could assist investors in determining\nwhether registrants have incorporated such risks into their long-term strategy. Investors could\nsubsequently incorporate this information into asset prices, thereby more accurately pricing\nclimate-related risks and contributing to market efficiency.\nBoth scenario analysis methodologies and climate science, however, continue to advance\nand develop, which may pose significant challenges for some registrants. Specifically, the\nrequired data may be unavailable or costly to obtain. Furthermore, some registrants may lack the\nnecessary expertise, requiring them to hire external consultants to conduct the analysis. These\nchallenges may pose undue burdens with respect to difficulty and/or costs to some registrants,\nsuch as smaller companies and those that otherwise have no prior experience in scenario\nanalysis. For these reasons, the Commission is not proposing to mandate scenario analysis and\nrelated disclosure at this time.\n3. Require specific external protocol for GHG emissions disclosure\nAnother alternative would be to require registrants to follow an external protocol (e.g.,\nGHG protocol) for reporting emissions. Requiring a specific protocol may potentially benefit\ninvestors by providing a more consistent and comparable framework in reporting emissions, thus\nfacilitating investors\u2019 information processing. However, there also may be certain drawbacks.\n407\n\nFirst, the organizational boundaries adopted by external protocols may create\ninconsistencies with the way companies would report information about their GHG emissions\nvis-\u00e0-vis the rest of their financial statements. The GHG Protocol, for example, requires that a\ncompany base its organizational boundaries on either an equity share approach or a control\napproach, which may differ from the way registrants set their scope for the purpose of reporting\ninformation in their financial statements. The proposed rules would require a registrant to set the\norganizational boundaries for its GHG emissions disclosure using the same scope of entities,\noperations, assets, and other holdings as those included in its consolidated financial statements.\nRequiring a consistent scope of consolidation and reporting between financial data and GHG\nemissions data should help avoid potential investor confusion about the reporting scope used in\ndetermining a registrant\u2019s GHG emissions and the reporting scope used for the financial\nstatement metrics.\nFurthermore, requiring companies to follow a specific external protocol might limit\nflexibility for registrants and thus reduce their ability to report emissions in a manner that is\ntailored to their specific circumstances. For example, registrants following an existing but\ndifferent protocol, which nevertheless provides relevant emissions information, would be\nrequired to switch protocols, incurring additional cost.\nRequiring compliance with a specific protocol could also reduce the scope for innovation\nin driving the most appropriate forms of disclosure within these overarching guidelines (e.g., the\nmethodologies pertaining to the measurement of GHG emissions, particularly Scope 3 emissions,\nare still evolving). Additionally, requiring compliance with a specific external protocol as of the\ndate of the adoption of any final rules may become problematic in the future to the extent that the\nexternal protocol\u2019s methodologies shift or evolve such that the version incorporated by reference\n408"

Specifically,\nmanagement could be required to include a statement in the annual report on their responsibility\nfor the design and evaluation of controls over GHG emission disclosures, as well as to disclose\ntheir conclusion regarding the effectiveness of controls over GHG emissions disclosures, in\naddition to the existing DCP evaluation and disclosure. In addition, we could require a GHG\nemissions attestation provider to obtain reasonable assurance on whether material weaknesses\nexist regarding management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of controls over GHG emissions\ndisclosures as of the measurement date. The GHG emissions attestation provider could also be\nrequired to issue an attestation report on the effectiveness of controls over GHG emissions\ndisclosures.997\nBy requiring GHG emissions attestation providers to assess not just the disclosures, but\nalso the controls over GHG emissions disclosures (i.e., the underlying mechanisms, rules, and\nprocedures associated with generating such disclosures), this alternative could further strengthen\nthe integrity of the disclosed information. In the context of emissions, GHG emissions\nattestation providers may evaluate and test the effectiveness of registrants\u2019 controls related to the\ncollection, calculation, estimation, and validation of GHG emissions data and disclosure. These\nprocesses could strengthen disclosure credibility as they reduce the likelihood of errors or fraud\n997 See AICPA, AU-C 940, An Audit of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting That Is Integrated With an\nAudit of Financial Statements (2021), available at\nhttps://www.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/research/standards/auditattest/downloadabledocuments/au-c-\n00940.pdf.\n412\n\nand their ensuing misstatements.998 Investors would benefit from any resulting improvement in\ndisclosure reliability for reasons discussed in prior sections: it would allow investors to make\nbetter-informed investment decisions, allow applicable information to be better incorporated into\nasset prices, and contribute to a more efficient allocation of capital. Registrants may also benefit\nvia reduced costs of capital and increased stock liquidity.\nHowever, this alternative would also impose additional assurance costs.999 Given that\nGHG emissions measurement and disclosure are developing areas, it is unclear what exact\ncontrols are or would be in effect, making it difficult to anticipate precisely what such attestation\nwould entail. These uncertainties pose further difficulties in obtaining informative cost estimates\nand, accordingly, accurate assessments of how burdensome such a requirement would be to\nregistrants. This leaves the possibility that the costs could outweigh the incremental benefits\ngiven that the proposed rules already require assurance for Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosures\nfor applicable registrants. For these reasons, the Commission is not proposing at this time to\nrequire an attestation report on the effectiveness of controls over GHG emissions disclosures.\n998 Potentially consistent with this, though in a different setting, academic evidence surrounding Section 404 of the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) finds lower accruals and discretionary accruals for small firms whose 2002 float\n(prior to when firms could have known and therefore tried to alter their float to avoid the regulation) made them\nlikely to be just above the requirements for compliance, relative to those just below.

We have similarly converted this dollar cost average to 5,000 burden\nhours.1020 The US waste management company reported that its employees spent 82 hours\nannually to produce its climate-related disclosures. The average annual internal burden hours\nspent on climate reporting for these three companies comes to 3,967 hours.1021\nThe UK Impact Assessment estimated on an ongoing, annual basis the number of hours\nand costs that it would take in-house personnel1022 to gather data and prepare and provide\ndisclosure for each of the following TCFD-aligned topics: governance, strategy, risk\nmanagement, and metrics and targets.1023 The impact assessment also estimated on an annual,\nongoing basis the number of hours and costs that it would take a parent company\u2019s personnel to\n1017 See supra Section IV.C.2 for a more detailed discussion of these reported costs.\n1018 $250,000 + $500,000 = $750,000. $750,000/2 = $375,000.\n1019 This metric is based on a reported national annual average salary for a climate specialist of $114,463.

This firm provided one cost estimate for preparing TCFD-aligned disclosures\nprimarily covering physical risk and transition risk assessment and analysis, which, for a\ncompany lacking any experience in climate reporting, ranged from $150,000 to $200,000 (an\naverage of $175,000) in the first year of reporting.1027 For a company with prior experience in\nGHG emissions reporting but requiring assistance with TCFD-aligned reporting, the firm\n1024 This estimate was 85 hrs.\n1025 The primary difference between the Initial Impact Assessment and Final Impact Assessment concerned the\nestimated \u201cfamiliarization\u201d costs. The Final Impact Assessment assumed that the rule would require scenario\nanalysis and added additional hours for in-house personnel to become familiar with scenario analysis\nmethodology. Because our proposed rules do not require scenario analysis, we are using the familiarization\nestimate of the Initial Impact Assessment (323 hrs.) when totaling the estimated hours required to comply with\nthe UK\u2019s proposed climate disclosure rules. We have added to the familiarization estimate the number of hours\n(77 hrs.) that the Final Impact Assessment estimated for the one-time legal review of the new climate disclosure\nrequirements by in-house personnel.\n1026 400 hrs.

For purposes of the PRA, we\nhave allocated approximately half of the hours pertaining to familiarization and review and parent company\nprocessing between the qualitative TCFD-aligned disclosure and the GHG emissions metrics and targets\ndisclosure. This results in 977.5 hrs. allocated to the qualitative TCFD-aligned disclosure and 2,469.5 hrs.\nallocated to the GHG emissions metrics and targets disclosure.\n1027 See memorandum concerning staff meeting with representatives of S&P Global. $150,000 + $200,000 =\n$350,000; $350,000/2 = $175,000.\n425\n\nestimated average costs of $100,000.1028 This results in an average cost estimate for all\ncompanies for TCFD-aligned disclosures, excluding GHG emissions calculation and reporting,\nof $137,500 in the first year of TCFD-aligned reporting.1029 For PRA purposes, we have\nconverted this dollar cost average to 2,500 burden hours.1030\nThis data analytics firm provided a separate cost estimate for calculating a company\u2019s\nScopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions.1031 For the initial calculation of a company\u2019s GHG emissions,\nincluding all three scopes, the cost estimate ranged from $75,000 to $125,000 (an average of\n$100,000).1032 The firm also estimated that the setting and reporting of GHG emissions targets\nwould on average add an additional $25,000, resulting in an average first-year cost estimate for\nGHG emissions metrics and targets of $125,000.1033 For PRA purposes, we have converted this\ndollar cost average to 2,273 burden hours.1034 This results in a total incremental burden increase\n(for both TCFD-aligned disclosures and GHG emissions calculation) in the first year of climate-\nrelated reporting of 4,773 burden hours.1035\n1028 See id.\n1029 $175,000 + $100,000 = $275,000; $275,000/2 = $137,500.\n1030 $137,500/$55/hr. = 2,500 hrs.\n1031 See memorandum concerning staff meeting with representatives of S&P Global. Although the proposed rules\nwould require the disclosure of a registrant\u2019s Scope 3 emissions only if they are material, this cost estimate is\nrelevant for determining the upper bound of the proposed rules\u2019 estimated PRA burden.\n1032 $75,000 + $125,000 = $200,000; $200,000/2 = $100,000.\n1033 Although the proposed rules would not require a registrant to set GHG emissions targets, they would require\ncertain disclosures if the registrant does set targets. We have therefore included S&P Global\u2019s cost estimate for\ntargets for purposes of determining the upper bound of the proposed rules\u2019 estimated PRA burden. However,\nbecause setting targets would be voluntary under the proposed rules, the estimated PRA burden may overstate\nthe potential burden.\n1034 $125,000/$55/hr. = 2,273 hrs.\n1035 2,500 hrs. + 2,273 hrs. = 4,773 hrs.\n426\n\nWe also considered the cost estimates for GHG emissions measurement and reporting\nprovided by two climate management firms, Persefoni and South Pole. Persefoni estimated that,\ndepending on the maturity of a company\u2019s emissions reporting program, a company\u2019s average\nfirst-year costs for measuring and reporting Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions ranged from $50,000 to\n$125,000, which averages to $87,500, or 1,591 hours.1036 South Pole estimated annual costs for\nmeasuring and reporting Scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions as ranging from $11,800 to $118,300,\nwhich averages to $65,050, or 1,183 hours.1037\nThe UK Impact Assessment estimated that the calculation and reporting of GHG\nemissions metrics and related targets would take the greatest amount of time, constituting\napproximately 72 percent of the total incremental burden.1038 The data analytics firm, however,\nestimated that GHG emissions metrics and targets would constitute approximately 48 percent of\nthe total incremental burden.1039 The burden estimates provided by the above-referenced\ncommenter and Climate Lab did not allocate between GHG emissions and non-GHG emissions\nclimate reporting. For purposes of the PRA, we have allocated the burden estimates from the\ncommenter and Climate Lab equally between the qualitative TCFD-aligned disclosure and the\nGHG emissions metrics and targets disclosure.1040\n1036 See memorandum concerning staff meeting with representatives of Persefoni. $50,000 + $125,000 = $175,000;\n$175,000/2 = $87,500; $87,500/$55/hr. = 1,591 hrs.\n1037 See memorandum concerning staff meeting with representatives of South Pole. $11,800 + $118,300 =\n$130,100; $130,100/2 = $65,050; $65,050/$55/hr. = 1,183 hrs.\n1038 See supra note 1026 (2,469.5 hrs./3,447 hrs. = 72 percent).\n1039 See supra note 1035 (2,273 hrs./4,773 hrs. = 48 percent).\n1040 For the Society for Corporate Governance-derived estimate, this results in 3,406.5 hrs. for each of the\nqualitative TCFD-aligned disclosure and the GHG emissions metrics and targets disclosure. For the Climate\nLab-derived burden estimate, this results in 1,983.5 burden hrs. for each of the qualitative and quantitative\ndisclosures.\n427\n\nBased on the above sources, we estimate that the proposed qualitative TCFD-aligned\ndisclosures would result in an average incremental burden hour increase of 2,217 hrs. for each\naffected collection of information for the first year of climate reporting.1041 We estimate that the\nproposed GHG emissions metrics and targets disclosure would result in an average incremental\nburden hour increase of 2,151 hours for each affected collection of information for the first year\nof reporting.1042\nIn addition to GHG emissions metrics, the proposed rules would require the disclosure of\ncertain climate-related financial statement metrics. Although the TCFD recommends the\ndisclosure of metrics pertaining to the financial impacts of climate-related events and conditions,\nit is unclear whether the above sources\u2019 burden estimates for TCFD-aligned disclosure would\ninclude financial statement metrics. Based on staff experience reviewing financial statements,\nwe estimate that preparation of the financial statements to present the proposed financial\nstatement metrics would require 70 additional burden hours per filing. To ensure that our PRA\nestimates cover the burden associated with the proposed climate-related financial statement\nmetrics, we have included this amount, in addition to the burden estimate for GHG emissions\nmetrics and targets, in the estimated overall PRA burden of the proposed rules.\nThe proposed rules would require a registrant to present the climate-related financial\nstatement metrics and associated disclosures in a note to its financial statements, which would be\naudited. Because the audit of such information would be part of the registrant\u2019s overall audit of\nits financial statements, we expect the incremental audit costs associated with these climate-\n1041 3,406.5 hrs.

We derived this estimate by first estimating costs\nas an average percentage of total audit fees (1.5%)1044 and then applying that percentage to\nmedian audit fees of $690,000,1045 which results in $10,350. To be conservative, we have\nincreased this amount to $15,000 for estimated audit fees. We believe that this estimate\nrepresents the average cost of the incremental efforts that may be incurred, taking into\nconsideration factors such as the scale and complexity of different registrants and the extent of\nimpact by climate-related events (e.g., location of operations, nature of business). This cost also\ntakes into consideration the need to understand and evaluate the registrants\u2019 processes and\ninternal controls associated with the reporting of the climate-related financial statement metrics\nand associated disclosures.\n1043 This belief is based on post-implementation review observations and activities from accounting standards that\nprovided further disaggregation of information and that are analogous to the proposed financial statement\nmetrics requirements, as discussed supra Section II.F.2.a (e.g., segment reporting and disaggregation of\nrevenue). See FASB\u2019s post-implementation review report on FASB Statement No. 131, Disclosures about\nSegments of an Enterprise and Related Information (Dec. 2012), 11, (\u201cPreparers\u2019 incremental costs to\nimplement and comply with Statement 131 generally were not significant and were in line with expectations\u201d),\navailable at\nhttps://www.accountingfoundation.org/cs/Satellite?c=Document_C&cid=1176160621900&pagename=Foundati\non%2FDocument_C%2FDocumentPage.

Following a\none-year phase-in period in which no attestation report would be required, for filings made for\nthe second and third fiscal years following the compliance date for the GHG emissions\ndisclosure requirement, large accelerated filers would be required to obtain an attestation report\nfor their Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosure, at minimum, at a limited assurance level. We\nestimate the cost of a limited assurance attestation report covering a large accelerated filer\u2019s\nScopes 1 and 2 emissions to be $110,000.1048 Commencing with the fourth fiscal year following\nthe compliance date and thereafter, a large accelerated filer would be required to obtain an\nattestation report covering its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosure at a reasonable assurance\nlevel. We estimate the cost for such a reasonable assurance attestation report to be $175,000.1049\nThis results in an initial six-year average1050 assurance cost for a large accelerated filer\u2019s Scopes\n1 and 2 emissions of $124,167.1051\nFollowing a one-year phase-in period in which no attestation report would be required,\nfor filings made for the second and third fiscal years following the compliance date for the GHG\n1046 Based on staff review of filings made in 2020, large accelerated filers filed approximately 31% of domestic\nforms and approximately 37% of Form 20-Fs in 2020. For PRA purposes, we have used 37% as a proxy for the\npercentage of all foreign private issuer forms filed by large accelerated filers in 2020.\n1047 Based on staff review of filings made in 2020, accelerated filers filed approximately 11% of domestic forms and\n15% of Form 20-Fs in 2020.\n1048 See supra Section IV.C.2.a.3. for the basis of this limited assurance cost estimate.\n1049 See id.\n1050 In order to capture three years of the cost of a reasonable assurance attestation report required for accelerated\nfilers and large accelerated filers, which requirement does not commence until the fourth fiscal year following\nthe proposed rules\u2019 compliance date, we have used a six-year average when calculating the estimated paperwork\nburden effects of the proposed rules.\n1051 0 + $110,000 + $110,000 + $175,000 + $175,000 + $175,000 = $745,000; $745,000/6 = $124,167.\n430\n\nemissions disclosure requirement, accelerated filers would be required to obtain an attestation\nreport for their Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosure, at minimum, at a limited assurance level.\nWe estimate the cost of a limited assurance attestation report covering an accelerated filer\u2019s\nScopes 1 and 2 emissions to be $45,000.1052 Commencing with the fourth fiscal year following\nthe compliance date and thereafter, an accelerated filer would be required to obtain an attestation\nreport covering its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosure at a reasonable assurance level. We\nestimate the cost for such a reasonable assurance attestation report to be $75,000.1053 This results\nin an initial six-year average assurance cost for an accelerated filer\u2019s Scopes 1 and 2 emissions of\n$52,500.1054\nThe proposed rules would require a registrant that is not required to include a GHG\nemissions attestation report to state whether any of the registrant\u2019s GHG emissions disclosures\nwere subject to third-party attestation or verification. If so, the registrant would be required to\nidentify the provider of assurance or verification and disclose certain additional information,\nsuch as the level and scope of assurance or verification provided, among other matters.1055 The\nburden and costs for this disclosure are encompassed within the estimated overall internal burden\nand costs for the proposed GHG emissions disclosure.\nThe UK Impact Assessment assumed a 25 percent reduction in hour and cost estimates\nfor the work required to comply with the GHG emissions metrics and targets disclosure\nrequirement in Year 2 compared to Year 1 because initial implementation of the metrics and\n1052 See supra Section IV.C.2.a.3. for the basis of this limited assurance cost estimate.\n1053 See id.\n1054 0 + $45,000 + $45,000 + $75,000 + $75,000 + $75,000 = $315,000; $315,000/6 = $52,500.\n1055 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(e).\n431\n\ntargets framework would not need to be repeated. We believe this assumption is reasonable and\nhave made a similar reduction after the first year of compliance when calculating the four-year\naverage for the estimated paperwork burden hour effect of the proposed rules. We also have\nassumed a 10 percent reduction in the hour and cost estimates for preparing and providing the\ndisclosures for the other TCFD-aligned topics in Years 2 through 6 compared to Year 1. We\nbelieve that this assumption is reasonable because the burden hours and costs associated with\nbecoming familiar with the other TCFD disclosure topics would not need to be repeated.1056 We\nbelieve that the reduction in the compliance burden and costs for the metrics and targets\ndisclosure requirement would be greater than the reduction for the other TCFD-aligned\ndisclosure topics because the initial work to implement a climate data collection and reporting\nframework to comply with the metrics and targets requirement would be greater than the initial\nframework required for the other disclosure requirements.\nSRCs, which comprise 50 percent of domestic filers, and 45 percent of total affected\nregistrants,1057 would bear a lesser compliance burden because those registrants would not be\nsubject to the proposed disclosure requirement pertaining to Scope 3 emissions, which, of the\nthree types of GHG emissions, poses the greatest challenge to calculate and report. We\naccordingly estimate that the increase in the PRA burden pertaining to the GHG emissions\nrequirement for SRCs filing on domestic forms would be approximately 50% less than the\n1056 S&P Global estimated a similar reduction in costs in subsequent years, the magnitude of which depends on the\nextent of material changes to the TCFD-aligned disclosure and the GHG emissions metrics.\n1057 In 2020, there were 6,220 domestic filers + 740 foreign private issuer (fpi) filers = 6,960 affected filers. 3,110\ndomestic filers + 740 fpi filers = 3,850 non-SRC filers. 3,850/6,960 = 55%. 3,110 filers were SRCs in 2020.\n3,110/6,960 = 45%. See supra Section IV.B.\n432\n\nincreased burden for the GHG emissions requirement for non-SRC registrants.1058 Smaller\nforeign private issuers that file on the foreign private issuer forms would not be eligible for this\nadjustment because those foreign private issuers are excluded from the definition of, and\ntherefore cannot be, SRCs.1059\nIn addition to requiring the annual climate disclosures, the proposed rules would require a\nregistrant to disclose any material change to its climate-related disclosures reported in its annual\nExchange Act annual report (Form 10-K or 20-F) on a Form 10-Q (if a domestic filer) or a Form\n6-K (if a foreign private issuer filer). We would not expect a registrant to report such a material\nchange until its second year of compliance, at the earliest. Based on the staff\u2019s assessment of the\namount of time it would take to determine that there has been a material change in the previously\nreported climate disclosure, particularly concerning its GHG emissions metrics, and to prepare\ndisclosures regarding the material change, if any, we estimate a burden hour increase of 40 hours\nper form, or an initial six-year average of 33 hours per form.1060\nThe following table summarizes the estimated paperwork burden effects of the proposed\namendments for non-SRC and SRC registrants associated with the affected collections of\ninformation.\nPRA Table 1. Estimated Paperwork Burden Effects of the Proposed Amendments\nfor Non-SRC and SRC Registrants1\n1058 This is generally consistent with some of the cost estimates obtained for calculating and reporting Scopes 1, 2,\nand 3 emissions. For example, Persefoni indicated that the annual GHG emissions costs for a company having\nexperience calculating and reporting GHG emissions would double if it included Scope 3 emissions after\ncalculating Scopes 1 and 2 emissions. See supra note 1013. In addition, S&P Global indicated that a\ncompany\u2019s annual ongoing reporting costs of Scopes 1 and 2 emissions would, at a minimum, increase from\n$40,000 to $75,000 if it included Scope 3 emissions.

Incremental and Aggregate Burden and Cost Estimates for the Proposed\nAmendments\nBelow we estimate the incremental and aggregate increase in paperwork burden resulting\nfrom the proposed amendments. These estimates represent the average burden for all issuers,\nboth large and small. In deriving our estimates, we recognize that the burdens will likely vary\namong individual registrants based on a number of factors, including the nature of their business,\nthe size and complexity of their operations, and whether they are subject to similar climate-\nrelated disclosure requirements in other jurisdictions or already preparing similar disclosures on\na voluntary basis. For purposes of the PRA, the burden is to be allocated between internal\nburden hours and outside professional costs. The table below sets forth the percentage estimates\nwe typically use for the burden allocation for each affected collection of information. We also\nestimate that the average cost of retaining outside professionals is $400 per hour.1061\nPRA Table 2.

For this reason, many\ninvestors\u2014including shareholders, investment advisors, and investment management\ncompanies\u2014currently seek information about climate-related risks from companies to inform\ntheir investment decision-making. Furthermore, many companies have begun to provide some of\nthis information voluntarily in response to investor demand and in recognition of the potential\nfinancial effects of climate-related risks on their businesses. We are concerned that the existing\nvoluntary disclosures of climate-related risks do not adequately protect investors. For this\nreason, mandatory disclosures may be necessary or appropriate to improve the consistency,\ncomparability, and reliability of this information.

We estimate that\nthere are 1,004 registrants that are small entities that would be affected by the proposed rules.\nD. Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements\nThe proposed amendments would require a registrant, including a small entity, to disclose\ncertain climate-related information, including data about their GHG emissions, when filing a\nSecurities Act or Exchange Act registration statement or Exchange Act annual or other periodic\nreport. In particular, like larger registrants, small entities would be required to disclose\ninformation about: the oversight of their boards and management regarding climate-related risks;\nany material impacts of climate-related risks on their consolidated financial statements, business,\nstrategy, and outlook; their risk management of climate-related risks; climate-related targets or\ngoals, if any; and certain financial statement metrics. In addition, like other registrants, small\nentities would be required to disclose their Scopes 1 and 2 emissions. We anticipate that the\nnature of any benefits or costs associated with the above proposed amendments would be similar\nfor large and small entities. Accordingly, we refer to the discussion of the proposed\namendments\u2019 economic effects on all affected parties, including small entities, in Section IV.C.\nConsistent with that discussion, we anticipate that the economic benefits and costs likely would\nvary widely among small entities based on a number of factors, including the nature and conduct\nof their businesses, which makes it difficult to project the economic impact on small entities with\nprecision. However, we request comment on how the proposed amendments would affect small\nentities.\n445"

Duplicative, Overlapping, or Conflicting Federal Rules\nThe proposed rules do not duplicate or conflict with other existing federal rules. As\ndiscussed in Section IV, some registrants currently report certain GHG emissions via the EPA\u2019s\n2009 mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. However, as discussed above, the\nreporting requirements of the EPA\u2019s program and the resulting data are different and more suited\nto the purpose of building a national inventory of GHG emissions rather than allowing investors\nto assess emissions-related risks to individual registrants.\n1066 See supra Section II.G.3 and II.L (discussing the proposed exemption from Scope 3 emissions disclosure for\nsmaller reporting companies).\n1067 See supra Section II.L (discussing the proposed additional two years for smaller reporting companies to comply\nwith the proposed rules compared to large accelerated filers).\n446"

    "text": "F. Significant Alternatives\nThe RFA directs us to consider alternatives that would accomplish our stated objectives,\nwhile minimizing any significant economic impact on small entities. In connection with the\nproposed amendments, we considered the following alternatives:\n\u2022 Establishing different compliance or reporting requirements that take into account the\nresources available to small entities;\n\u2022 Clarifying, consolidating, or simplifying compliance and reporting requirements under\nthe rules for small entities;\n\u2022 Using performance rather than design standards; and\n\u2022 Exempting small entities from all or part of the requirements.\nAs discussed above, the proposed amendments would exempt small entities from certain\nGHG emissions disclosure requirements that would likely impose the greatest compliance\nburden on registrants compared to other proposed disclosure requirements. In addition, while\nthere would be a transition period for all registrants to comply with the proposed amendments,\nsmall entities would have an additional two more years to comply with the proposed rules than\nlarge accelerated filers and an additional year compared to other registrants. We believe that this\nscaled and phased-in approach would help minimize the economic impact of the proposed\namendments on small entities. We are not, however, proposing a complete exemption from the\nproposed amendments for SRCs because, due to their broad impact across industries and\njurisdictions, climate-related risks may materially impact the operations and financial condition\nof domestic and foreign issuers, both large and small.\nFor similar reasons, other than the exemption for reporting Scope 3 emissions by SRCs,\nwe are not proposing to clarify, consolidate, or simplify the proposed disclosure requirements for\n447\n\nsmall entities. A key objective of the proposed amendments is to elicit consistent, comparable\nand reliable information about climate-related risks across registrants. Alternative compliance\nrequirements for small entities could undermine that goal.\nThe proposed amendments are primarily based on performance standards with some\nprovisions that are more like design standards. For example, while the proposed amendments\ninclude certain concepts, such as scopes, developed by the GHG Protocol, they do not require a\nregistrant to use the GHG Protocol\u2019s methodology when calculating its GHG emissions if\nanother methodology better suits its circumstances. Using a performance standard for\ncalculation of GHG emissions would provide registrants with some flexibility regarding how to\ncomply with the proposed GHG emissions requirement while still providing useful information\nfor investors about the various scopes of emissions. Similarly, the proposed amendments would\nrequire a registrant that is a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer to include an attestation\nreport covering its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions that would require the report to meet certain\nminimum criteria while permitting the filer, at its option, to obtain additional levels of assurance.\nIn contrast, the proposed amendments would require all registrants, including small entities, to\nexpress their GHG emissions both disaggregated by each constituent greenhouse gas and in the\naggregate, expressed in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO e). Using a design standard for\n2\nthe expression of a registrant\u2019s GHG emissions would enhance the comparability of this\ndisclosure for investors.\nRequest for Comment\nWe encourage the submission of comments with respect to any aspect of this IRFA. In\nparticular, we request comments regarding:\n448"

If a\nseparate board or management committee is responsible for assessing and managing climate-\nrelated risks, a registrant should disclose how that committee interacts with the registrant\u2019s board\nor management committee governing risks.\n467\n\n(c)(1) If the registrant has adopted a transition plan as part of its climate-related risk\nmanagement strategy, describe the plan, including the relevant metrics and targets used to\nidentify and manage any physical and transition risks. To allow for an understanding of the\nregistrant\u2019s progress to meet the plan\u2019s targets or goals over time, a registrant must update its\ndisclosure about the transition plan each fiscal year by describing the actions taken during the\nyear to achieve the plan\u2019s targets or goals.\n(2) If the registrant has adopted a transition plan, discuss, as applicable:\n(i) How the registrant plans to mitigate or adapt to any identified physical risks, including\nbut not limited to those concerning energy, land, or water use and management;\n(ii) How the registrant plans to mitigate or adapt to any identified transition risks,\nincluding the following:\n(A) Laws, regulations, or policies that:\n(1) Restrict GHG emissions or products with high GHG footprints, including emissions\ncaps; or\n(2) Require the protection of high conservation value land or natural assets;\n(B) Imposition of a carbon price; and\n(C) Changing demands or preferences of consumers, investors, employees, and business\ncounterparties.\n(3) If applicable, a registrant that has adopted a transition plan as part of its climate-\nrelated risk management strategy may also describe how it plans to achieve any identified\nclimate-related opportunities, such as:\n(i) The production of products that may facilitate the transition to a lower carbon\neconomy, such as low emission modes of transportation and supporting infrastructure;\n468\n\n(ii) The generation or use of renewable power;\n(iii) The production or use of low waste, recycled, or other consumer products that\nrequire less carbon intensive production methods;\n(iv) The setting of conservation goals and targets that would help reduce GHG emissions;\nand\n(v) The provision of services related to any transition to a lower carbon economy.\n\u00a7 229.1504 (Item 1504) GHG emissions metrics.\n(a) General. Disclose a registrant\u2019s GHG emissions, as defined in \u00a7 229.1500(h), for its\nmost recently completed fiscal year, and for the historical fiscal years included in its\nconsolidated financial statements in the filing, to the extent such historical GHG emissions data\nis reasonably available.\n(1) For each required disclosure of a registrant\u2019s Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions, disclose\nthe emissions both disaggregated by each constituent greenhouse gas, as specified in\n\u00a7 229.1500(g), and in the aggregate, expressed in terms of CO e.\n2\n(2) When disclosing a registrant\u2019s Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions, exclude the impact of\nany purchased or generated offsets.\n(b) Scopes 1 and 2 emissions.\n(1) Disclose the registrant\u2019s total Scope 1 emissions and total Scope 2 emissions\nseparately after calculating them from all sources that are included in the registrant\u2019s\norganizational and operational boundaries.\n(2) When calculating emissions pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a registrant\nmay exclude emissions from investments that are not consolidated, are not proportionately\n469\n\nconsolidated, or that do not qualify for the equity method of accounting in the registrant\u2019s\nconsolidated financial statements.\n(c) Scope 3 emissions.\n(1) Disclose the registrant\u2019s total Scope 3 emissions if material. A registrant must also\ndisclose its Scope 3 emissions if it has set a GHG emissions reduction target or goal that includes\nits Scope 3 emissions. Disclosure of a registrant\u2019s Scope 3 emissions must be separate from\ndisclosure of its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions. If required to disclose Scope 3 emissions, identify\nthe categories of upstream or downstream activities that have been included in the calculation of\nthe Scope 3 emissions. If any category of Scope 3 emissions is significant to the registrant,\nidentify all such categories and provide Scope 3 emissions data separately for them, together\nwith the registrant\u2019s total Scope 3 emissions.\n(2) If required to disclose Scope 3 emissions, describe the data sources used to calculate\nthe registrant\u2019s Scope 3 emissions, including the use of any of the following:\n(i) Emissions reported by parties in the registrant\u2019s value chain, and whether such reports\nwere verified by the registrant or a third party, or unverified;\n(ii) Data concerning specific activities, as reported by parties in the registrant\u2019s value\nchain; and\n(iii) Data derived from economic studies, published databases, government statistics,\nindustry associations, or other third-party sources outside of a registrant\u2019s value chain, including\nindustry averages of emissions, activities, or economic data.\n(3) A smaller reporting company, as defined by \u00a7\u00a7 229.10(f)(1), 230.405, and\n240.12b-2 of this chapter, is exempt from, and need not comply with, the disclosure requirements\nof this paragraph (c).\n470\n\n(d) GHG intensity.\n(1) Using the sum of Scope 1 and 2 emissions, disclose GHG intensity in terms of metric\ntons of CO e per unit of total revenue (using the registrant\u2019s reporting currency) and per unit of\n2\nproduction relevant to the registrant\u2019s industry for each fiscal year included in the consolidated\nfinancial statements. Disclose the basis for the unit of production used.\n(2) If Scope 3 emissions are otherwise disclosed, separately disclose GHG intensity using\nScope 3 emissions only.\n(3) If a registrant has no revenue or unit of production for a fiscal year, it must disclose\nanother financial measure of GHG intensity or another measure of GHG intensity per unit of\neconomic output, as applicable, with an explanation of why the particular measure was used.\n(4) A registrant may also disclose other measures of GHG intensity, in addition to metric\ntons of CO e per unit of total revenue (using the registrant\u2019s reporting currency) and per unit of\n2\nproduction, if it includes an explanation of why a particular measure was used and why the\nregistrant believes such measure provides useful information to investors.\n(e) Methodology and related instructions.\n(1) A registrant must describe the methodology, significant inputs, and significant\nassumptions used to calculate its GHG emissions. The description of the registrant\u2019s\nmethodology must include the registrant\u2019s organizational boundaries, operational boundaries\n(including any approach to categorization of emissions and emissions sources), calculation\napproach (including any emission factors used and the source of the emission factors), and any\ncalculation tools used to calculate the GHG emissions. A registrant\u2019s description of its approach\nto categorization of emissions and emissions sources should explain how it determined the\n471\n\nemissions to include as direct emissions, for the purpose of calculating its Scope 1 emissions,\nand indirect emissions, for the purpose of calculating its Scope 2 emissions.\n(2) The organizational boundary and any determination of whether a registrant owns or\ncontrols a particular source for GHG emissions must be consistent with the scope of entities,\noperations, assets, and other holdings within its business organization as those included in, and\nbased upon the same set of accounting principles applicable to, the registrant\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial statements.\n(3) A registrant must use the same organizational boundaries when calculating its Scope\n1 emissions and Scope 2 emissions. If required to disclose Scope 3 emissions, a registrant must\nalso apply the same organizational boundaries used when determining its Scopes 1 and 2\nemissions as an initial step in identifying the sources of indirect emissions from activities in its\nvalue chain over which it lacks ownership and control and which must be included in the\ncalculation of its Scope 3 emissions. Once a registrant has determined its organizational and\noperational boundaries, a registrant must be consistent in its use of those boundaries when\ncalculating its GHG emissions.\n(4) A registrant may use reasonable estimates when disclosing its GHG emissions as long\nas it also describes the assumptions underlying, and its reasons for using, the estimates.\n(i) When disclosing its GHG emissions for its most recently completed fiscal year, if\nactual reported data is not reasonably available, a registrant may use a reasonable estimate of its\nGHG emissions for its fourth fiscal quarter, together with actual, determined GHG emissions\ndata for the first three fiscal quarters, as long as the registrant promptly discloses in a subsequent\nfiling any material difference between the estimate used and the actual, determined GHG\nemissions data for the fourth fiscal quarter.\n472\n\n(ii) In addition to the use of reasonable estimates, a registrant may present its estimated\nScope 3 emissions in terms of a range as long as it discloses its reasons for using the range and\nthe underlying assumptions.\n(5) A registrant must disclose, to the extent material and as applicable, any use of third-\nparty data when calculating its GHG emissions, regardless of the particular scope of emissions.\nWhen disclosing the use of third-party data, it must identify the source of such data and the\nprocess the registrant undertook to obtain and assess such data.\n(6) A registrant must disclose any material change to the methodology or assumptions\nunderlying its GHG emissions disclosure from the previous fiscal year.\n(7) A registrant must disclose, to the extent material and as applicable, any gaps in the\ndata required to calculate its GHG emissions. A registrant\u2019s GHG emissions disclosure should\nprovide investors with a reasonably complete understanding of the registrant\u2019s GHG emissions in\neach scope of emissions. If a registrant discloses any data gaps encountered when calculating its\nGHG emissions, it must also discuss whether it used proxy data or another method to address\nsuch gaps, and how its accounting for any data gaps has affected the accuracy or completeness of\nits GHG emissions disclosure.\n(8) When determining whether its Scope 3 emissions are material, and when disclosing\nthose emissions, in addition to emissions from activities in its value chain, a registrant must\ninclude GHG emissions from outsourced activities that it previously conducted as part of its own\noperations, as reflected in the financial statements for the periods covered in the filing.\n(9) If required to disclose Scope 3 emissions, when calculating those emissions, if there\nwas any significant overlap in the categories of activities producing the Scope 3 emissions, a\n473\n\nregistrant must describe the overlap, how it accounted for the overlap, and the effect on its\ndisclosed total Scope 3 emissions.\n(f) Liability for Scope 3 emissions disclosures.\n(1) A statement within the coverage of paragraph (f)(2) of this section that is made by or\non behalf of a registrant is deemed not to be a fraudulent statement (as defined in paragraph\n(f)(3) of this section), unless it is shown that such statement was made or reaffirmed without a\nreasonable basis or was disclosed other than in good faith.\n(2) This paragraph (f) applies to any statement regarding Scope 3 emissions that is\ndisclosed pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 229.1500 through 229.1506 and made in a document filed with the\nCommission.\n(3) For the purpose of this paragraph (f), the term fraudulent statement shall mean a\nstatement that is an untrue statement of material fact, a statement false or misleading with respect\nto any material fact, an omission to state a material fact necessary to make a statement not\nmisleading, or that constitutes the employment of a manipulative, deceptive, or fraudulent\ndevice, contrivance, scheme, transaction, act, practice, course of business, or an artifice to\ndefraud as those terms are used in the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934 or the rules or regulations promulgated thereunder.\n\u00a7 229.1505 Attestation of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions disclosure.\n(a) Attestation.\n(1) A registrant that is required to provide Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions disclosure\npursuant to \u00a7 229.1504 and that is an accelerated filer or a large accelerated filer must include an\nattestation report covering such disclosure in the relevant filing. For filings made by an\naccelerated filer or a large accelerated filer for the second and third fiscal years after the\n474\n\ncompliance date for \u00a7 229.1504, the attestation engagement must, at a minimum, be at a limited\nassurance level and cover the registrant\u2019s Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions disclosure. For filings\nmade by an accelerated filer or large accelerated filer for the fourth fiscal year after the\ncompliance date for \u00a7 229.1504 and thereafter, the attestation engagement must be at a\nreasonable assurance level and, at a minimum, cover the registrant\u2019s Scope 1 and Scope 2\nemissions disclosures.\n(2) Any attestation report required under this section must be provided pursuant to\nstandards that are publicly available at no cost and are established by a body or group that has\nfollowed due process procedures, including the broad distribution of the framework for public\ncomment. An accelerated filer or a large accelerated filer obtaining voluntary assurance prior to\nthe first required fiscal year must comply with subparagraph (e) of this section. Voluntary\nassurance obtained by an accelerated filer or a large accelerated filer thereafter must follow the\nrequirements of paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section and must use the same attestation\nstandard as the required assurance over Scope 1 and Scope 2.\n(b) GHG emissions attestation provider. The GHG emissions attestation report required\nby paragraph (a) of this section must be prepared and signed by a GHG emissions attestation\nprovider. A GHG emissions attestation provider means a person or a firm that has all of the\nfollowing characteristics:\n(1) Is an expert in GHG emissions by virtue of having significant experience in\nmeasuring, analyzing, reporting, or attesting to GHG emissions. Significant experience means\nhaving sufficient competence and capabilities necessary to:\n(i) Perform engagements in accordance with professional standards and applicable legal\nand regulatory requirements; and\n475\n\n(ii) Enable the service provider to issue reports that are appropriate under the\ncircumstances.\n(2) Is independent with respect to the registrant, and any of its affiliates, for whom it is\nproviding the attestation report, during the attestation and professional engagement period.\n(i) A GHG emissions attestation provider is not independent if such attestation provider is\nnot, or a reasonable investor with knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would\nconclude that such attestation provider is not, capable of exercising objective and impartial\njudgment on all issues encompassed within the attestation provider\u2019s engagement.\n(ii) In determining whether a GHG emissions attestation provider is independent, the\nCommission will consider:\n(A) Whether a relationship or the provision of a service creates a mutual or conflicting\ninterest between the attestation provider and the registrant (or any of its affiliates), places the\nattestation provider in the position of attesting such attestation provider\u2019s own work, results in\nthe attestation provider acting as management or an employee of the registrant (or any of its\naffiliates), or places the attestation provider in a position of being an advocate for the registrant\n(or any of its affiliates); and\n(B) All relevant circumstances, including all financial or other relationships between the\nattestation provider and the registrant (or any of its affiliates), and not just those relating to\nreports filed with the Commission.\n(iii) The term \u201caffiliates\u201d as used in this section has the meaning provided in 17 CFR\n210.2-01, except that references to \u201caudit\u201d are deemed to be references to the attestation services\nprovided pursuant to this section.\n476\n\n(iv) The term \u201cattestation and professional engagement period\u201d as used in this section\nmeans both:\n(A) The period covered by the attestation report; and\n(B) The period of the engagement to attest to the registrant\u2019s GHG emissions or to\nprepare a report filed with the Commission (\u201cthe professional engagement period\u201d). The\nprofessional engagement period begins when the GHG attestation service provider either signs\nan initial engagement letter (or other agreement to attest a registrant\u2019s GHG emissions) or begins\nattest procedures, whichever is earlier.\n(c) Attestation report requirements. The GHG emissions attestation report required by\nparagraph (a) of this section must be included in the separately captioned \u201cClimate-Related\nDisclosure\u201d section in the filing. The form and content of the attestation report must follow the\nrequirements set forth by the attestation standard (or standards) used by the GHG emissions\nattestation provider. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at a minimum the report must include the\nfollowing:\n(1) An identification or description of the subject matter or assertion being reported on,\nincluding the point in time or period of time to which the measurement or evaluation of the\nsubject matter or assertion relates;\n(2) An identification of the criteria against which the subject matter was measured or\nevaluated;\n(3) A statement that identifies the level of assurance provided and describes the nature of\nthe engagement;\n(4) A statement that identifies the attestation standard (or standards) used;\n477\n\n(5) A statement that describes the registrant\u2019s responsibility to report on the subject\nmatter or assertion being reported on;\n(6) A statement that describes the attestation provider\u2019s responsibilities in connection\nwith the preparation of the attestation report;\n(7) A statement that the attestation provider is independent, as required by paragraph (a)\nof this section;\n(8) For a limited assurance engagement, a description of the work performed as a basis\nfor the attestation provider\u2019s conclusion;\n(9) A statement that describes significant inherent limitations, if any, associated with the\nmeasurement or evaluation of the subject matter against the criteria;\n(10) The GHG emissions attestation provider\u2019s conclusion or opinion, based on the\napplicable attestation standard(s) used;\n(11) The signature of the attestation provider (whether by an individual or a person\nsigning on behalf of the attestation provider\u2019s firm);\n(12) The city and state where the attestation report has been issued; and\n(13) The date of the report.\n(d) Additional disclosures by the registrant. In addition to including the GHG emissions\nattestation report required by paragraph (a) of this section, a large accelerated filer and an\naccelerated filer must disclose the following information within the separately captioned\n\u201cClimate-Related Disclosure\u201d section in the filing, after requesting relevant information from\nany GHG emissions attestation provider as necessary:\n478\n\n(1) Whether the attestation provider has a license from any licensing or accreditation\nbody to provide assurance, and if so, identify the licensing or accreditation body, and whether the\nattestation provider is a member in good standing of that licensing or accreditation body;\n(2) Whether the GHG emissions attestation engagement is subject to any oversight\ninspection program, and if so, which program (or programs); and\n(3) Whether the attestation provider is subject to record-keeping requirements with\nrespect to the work performed for the GHG emissions attestation engagement and, if so, identify\nthe record-keeping requirements and the duration of those requirements.\n(e) Disclosure of voluntary attestation. A registrant that is not required to include a GHG\nemissions attestation report pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section must disclose within the\nseparately captioned \u201cClimate-Related Disclosure\u201d section in the filing the following information\nif the registrant\u2019s GHG emissions disclosures were subject to third-party attestation or\nverification:\n(1) Identify the provider of such attestation or verification;\n(2) Describe the attestation or verification standard used;\n(3) Describe the level and scope of attestation or verification provided;\n(4) Briefly describe the results of the attestation or verification;\n(5) Disclose whether the third-party service provider has any other business relationships\nwith or has provided any other professional services to the registrant that may lead to an\nimpairment of the service provider\u2019s independence with respect to the registrant; and\n(6) Disclose any oversight inspection program to which the service provider is subject\n(e.g., the AICPA\u2019s peer review program).\n\u00a7 229.1506 (Item 1506) Targets and goals.\n479\n\n(a)(1) A registrant must provide disclosure pursuant to this section if it has set any targets\nor goals related to the reduction of GHG emissions, or any other climate-related target or goal\n(e.g., regarding energy usage, water usage, conservation or ecosystem restoration, or revenues\nfrom low-carbon products) such as actual or anticipated regulatory requirements, market\nconstraints, or other goals established by a climate-related treaty, law, regulation, policy, or\norganization.\n(2) A registrant may provide the disclosure required by this section as part of its\ndisclosure in response to \u00a7 229.1502 or \u00a7 229.1503.\n(b) If the registrant has set climate-related targets or goals, disclose the targets or goals,\nincluding, as applicable, a description of:\n(1) The scope of activities and emissions included in the target;\n(2) The unit of measurement, including whether the target is absolute or intensity based;\n(3) The defined time horizon by which the target is intended to be achieved, and whether\nthe time horizon is consistent with one or more goals established by a climate-related treaty, law,\nregulation, policy, or organization;\n(4) The defined baseline time period and baseline emissions against which progress will\nbe tracked with a consistent base year set for multiple targets;\n(5) Any interim targets set by the registrant; and\n(6) How the registrant intends to meet its climate-related targets or goals. For example,\nfor a target or goal regarding net GHG emissions reduction, the discussion could include a\nstrategy to increase energy efficiency, transition to lower carbon products, purchase carbon\noffsets or RECs, or engage in carbon removal and carbon storage.\n480\n\n(c) Disclose relevant data to indicate whether the registrant is making progress toward\nmeeting the target or goal and how such progress has been achieved. A registrant must update\nthis disclosure each fiscal year by describing the actions taken during the year to achieve its\ntargets or goals.\n(d) If carbon offsets or RECs have been used as part of a registrant\u2019s plan to achieve\nclimate-related targets or goals, disclose the amount of carbon reduction represented by the\noffsets or the amount of generated renewable energy represented by the RECS, the source of the\noffsets or RECs, a description and location of the underlying projects, any registries or other\nauthentication of the offsets or RECs, and the cost of the offsets or RECs.\n\u00a7 229.1507 (Item 1507) Interactive data requirement.\nProvide the disclosure required by this Subpart 1500 in an Interactive Data File as\nrequired by \u00a7 232.405 of this chapter (Rule 405 of Regulation S-T) in accordance with the\nEDGAR Filer Manual.\nPART 232\u2014 REGULATION S-T\u2014GENERAL RULES AND REGULATIONS FOR\nELECTRONIC FILINGS\n6.
