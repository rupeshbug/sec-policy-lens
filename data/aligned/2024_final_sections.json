INTRODUCTION\nClimate-related risks, their impacts, and a public company\u2019s response to those risks can\nsignificantly affect the company\u2019s financial performance and position.3 Accordingly, many\ninvestors and those acting on their behalf\u2014including investment advisers and investment\nmanagement companies\u2014currently seek information to assess how climate-related risks affect a\nregistrant\u2019s business and financial condition and thus the price of the registrant\u2019s securities.\nInvestors also seek climate-related information to assess a registrant\u2019s management and board\noversight of climate-related risks so as to inform their investment and voting decisions. In light\nof these investor needs, the Commission is adopting rules to require registrants to provide certain\ninformation about climate-related risks that have materially impacted, or are reasonably likely to\nhave a material impact on, the registrant\u2019s business strategy, results of operations, or financial\n3 See infra section I.A. For purposes of this release, we use the terms \u201cpublic companies,\u201d \u201ccompanies,\u201d\n\u201cregistrants,\u201d and \u201cissuers\u201d interchangeably and, unless explained in the text, the use of different terms in\ndifferent places is not meant to connote a significant difference.\n10\n\ncondition; the governance and management of such risks; and the financial statement effects of\nsevere weather events and other natural conditions in their registration statements and annual\nreports. This information, alongside disclosures on other risks that companies face, will assist\ninvestors in making decisions to buy, hold, sell, or vote securities in their portfolio.\nMany companies currently provide some information regarding climate-related risks. For\nexample, as discussed in more detail in section IV.A.5 below, some studies show that a third of\npublic companies disclose information about climate-related risks, mostly outside of\nCommission filings,4 and nearly 40 percent of all annual reports contain some climate-related\ndiscussion.5 In addition, Commission staff analysis found that approximately 20 percent of\npublic companies provide some information regarding their Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas\n(\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions, often outside of Commission filings, with the highest rate of emissions\ndisclosures found among large accelerated filers.6 Among companies in the Russell 1000 Index,\nbased on one analysis, these numbers are even higher, with 90 percent publicly disclosing some\nclimate-related information7 and almost 60 percent providing disclosures regarding their GHG\nemissions.8\nThe climate-related information that these companies currently provide, however, is\ninconsistent and often difficult for investors to find and/or compare across companies. As a\nresult, investors have expressed the need for more detailed, reliable, and comparable disclosure\n4 See, e.g., Center for Capital Markets, 2021 Survey Report: Climate Change & ESG Reporting from the\nPublic Company Perspective, available at https://www.centerforcapitalmarkets.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2021/08/CCMC_ESG_Report_v4.pdf, discussed infra in Section IV.A.5.\n5 See infra notes 2638-2639 and accompanying text.\n6 See infra notes 2675-2676 and accompanying text.\n7 See infra note 2666 and accompanying text.\n8 See infra note 2683 and accompanying text.\n11\n\nof information regarding climate-related risks. The requirements adopted in this release meet\nthat need by providing more complete and decision-useful information about the impacts of\nclimate-related risks on registrants, improving the consistency, comparability, and reliability of\nclimate-related information for investors. As a result, investors will be able to make more\ninformed investment and voting decisions.\nAs discussed in more detail throughout this release, disclosure of certain climate-related\nmatters is required in a number of Federal, State, and foreign jurisdictions.9 Companies\ncurrently often provide much of this information outside of Commission filings, in varying levels\nof detail, and in different documents and formats. Additionally, because of the importance of\nthis information to investors, a variety of third parties have developed climate-related reporting\nframeworks.10 Use of reporting frameworks is also often voluntary. Companies may disclose\ncertain information under one or more frameworks, may provide only partial disclosures, or may\nchoose not to provide consistent information year over year. As a result, reporting is fragmented\nand difficult for investors to compare across companies or across reporting periods. As\ncommenters have indicated, this lack of consistency and comparability increases costs to\ninvestors in obtaining and analyzing decision-useful information and impairs investors\u2019 ability to\nmake investment or voting decisions in line with their risk preferences.11 Investors have asked\n9 See, e.g., infra sections I.A (discussing certain international initiatives) and II.A.3 (discussing the Inflation\nReduction Act and recent California laws).\n10 See, e.g., Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, About, available at https://www.fsb-\ntcfd.org/about/; CDP Worldwide (\u201cCDP\u201d), About us, available at https://www.cdp.net/en/info/about-us;\nSustainability Accounting Standards Board (\u201cSASB\u201d) Standards, About us, available at\nhttps://sasb.org/about/; and Global Reporting Initiative (\u201cGRI\u201d), About GRI, available at\nhttps://www.globalreporting.org/about-gri/.

Requiring these additional disclosures in\nCommission filings will allow investors to evaluate together the range of risks that a company\nfaces, the existing and potential impacts of those risks, and the way that company management\nassesses and addresses those risks. Providing these disclosures in Commission filings also will\nsubject them to enhanced liability that provides important investor protections by promoting the\nreliability of the disclosures.\nThe Commission has required disclosure of certain environmental matters for the past 50\nyears,12 most recently issuing guidance in 2010 (\u201c2010 Guidance\u201d) on how existing rules may\nrequire disclosure of climate-related risks and their impacts on a registrant\u2019s business or financial\ncondition.13 Since the Commission issued the 2010 Guidance, there has been growing\nrecognition that climate-related risks affect public companies\u2019 business, results of operations,\nand financial condition.14 Our experience with the 2010 Guidance and current practices\nregarding disclosure of this information led us to conclude that, although many companies\n2022) (\u201cCalSTRS\u201d); Ceres (June 17, 2022) (\u201cCeres\u201d); Domini Impact Investments (June 17, 2022)\n(\u201cDomini Impact\u201d); Trillium Asset Management (Oct. 20, 2022) (\u201cTrillium\u201d); and Wellington Management\nCompany (June 17, 2022) (\u201cWellington Mgmt.\u201d); see also Proposing Release, section I.B, note 42 and\naccompanying text; and infra section IV.C. We discuss investors\u2019 need for more consistent, comparable,\nand decision-useful disclosure about registrants\u2019 climate-related risks in Sections I.A and II.A.3 below.\n12 See infra notes 202-203 and accompanying text.\n13 See Commission Guidance Regarding Disclosure Related to Climate Change, Release No. 33-9106 (Feb. 2,\n2010) [75 FR 6290 (Feb. 8, 2010)] (\u201c2010 Guidance\u201d); and discussion infra notes 204-205 and\naccompanying text. See also infra section II.B.\n14 See, e.g., letters from AllianceBernstein; Alphabet, Autodesk, Dropbox, eBay, Hewlett Packard Enterprise,\nHP Inc., Intel, Meta, PayPal, and Workday (June 17, 2022) (\u201cAlphabet et al.\u201d); Amazon (June 17, 2022);\nCalPERS; CalSTRS; Eni SpA (June 16, 2022) (\u201cEni SpA\u201d); Pacific Investment Management Company\n(June 17, 2022) (\u201cPIMCO\u201d); PricewaterhouseCoopers (June 17, 2022) (\u201cPwC\u201d); and Wellington Mgmt.\nSee also infra note 28 (discussing the Financial Stability Oversight Council\u2019s (\u201cFSOC\u2019s\u201d) Report on\nClimate-Related Financial Risk 2021).\n13\n\ndisclose some climate-related information, there was a need to both standardize and enhance the\ninformation available to investors about such matters and thus to propose an updated approach.15\nSince the proposal, ongoing regulatory developments and market practices with respect to\ndisclosure of climate-related risks have only underscored the need for enhanced disclosure\nrequirements in this area.16 Although current disclosure practices elicit some useful information\nabout climate-related risks, there remain significant deficiencies in the consistency and\ncompleteness of this information. We have therefore concluded that additional requirements are\nappropriate to ensure that investors have access to more complete and reliable information that\nwill enable them to make informed investment and voting decisions.17\nThe rules that we are adopting respond to investors\u2019 concerns regarding the adequacy of\ncurrent disclosure practices while taking into account comments received on the proposed rules.\nIn general terms, the final rules will elicit enhanced and more consistent and comparable\ndisclosure about the material risks that companies face and how companies manage those risks\nby requiring:\n\u2022 A description of any climate-related risks that have materially impacted or are reasonably\nlikely to have a material impact on the registrant, including on its strategy, results of\n15 See The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors, Release No.\n33-11042 (Mar. 21, 2022) [87 FR 21334 (Apr. 11, 2022)] (\u201cProposing Release\u201d).\n16 See infra Section II.A.3 for a discussion of recent foreign and state regulatory developments regarding the\ndisclosure of climate-related risks, including the announcement by several countries of their intention to\nadopt laws or regulations implementing the International Sustainability Standards Board\u2019s (\u201cISSB\u201d) climate\nreporting standard in whole or part; and certain recent California laws requiring the disclosure of climate-\nrelated risks and greenhouse gas emissions by certain large companies.\n17 Even after adoption of the final rules, the 2010 Guidance will still be relevant because it discusses existing\nCommission rules, such as those pertaining to a registrant\u2019s description of its business and certain legal\nproceedings, which require disclosure regarding, among other things, compliance with environmental laws\nand regulations that are only tangentially mentioned in this rulemaking. Registrants should continue to\nconsider the 2010 Guidance as they evaluate their disclosure obligations in their Description of Business,\nRisk Factors, Legal Proceedings, and Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis. These disclosures should be\nbased on the registrant\u2019s specific facts and circumstances.\n14\n\noperations, and financial condition, as well as the actual or potential material impacts of\nthose same risks on its strategy, business model, and outlook;\n\u2022 Specified disclosures, regarding a registrant\u2019s activities, if any, to mitigate or adapt to a\nmaterial climate-related risk or use of transition plans, scenario analysis or internal\ncarbon prices to manage a material climate-related risk;\n\u2022 Disclosure about any oversight by the registrant\u2019s board of directors of climate-related\nrisks and any role by management in assessing and managing material climate-related\nrisks;\n\u2022 A description of any processes the registrant uses to assess or manage material climate-\nrelated risks; and\n\u2022 Disclosure about any targets or goals that have materially affected or are reasonably\nlikely to materially affect the registrant\u2019s business, results of operations, or financial\ncondition.\nIn addition, to facilitate investors\u2019 assessment of particular types of risk, the final rules\nrequire:\n\u2022 Disclosure of Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions on a phased in basis by certain larger\nregistrants when those emissions are material, and the filing of an attestation report\ncovering the required disclosure of such registrants\u2019 Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions,\nalso on a phased in basis; and\n\u2022 Disclosure of the financial statement effects of severe weather events and other natural\nconditions including costs and losses.\n15\n\nA further summary of the final rules is presented below.18\nIn crafting the final rules, we benefited from extensive public comments. We received\nover 4,500 unique comment letters on the proposed climate-related disclosure rules and over\n18,000 form letters.19 Commenters included academics, accounting and audit firms, individuals,\nindustry groups, investor groups, law firms, non-governmental organizations, pension funds,\nprofessional climate advisors, professional investment advisers and investment management\ncompanies, registrants, standard-setters, state government officials, and U.S. Senators and\nMembers of the House of Representatives. Many commenters generally supported the proposal\nto require climate-related disclosure. Others opposed the proposed rules in whole or in part. In\naddition, the Commission\u2019s Investor Advisory Committee offered broad support for the proposal,\nwith recommendations for certain modifications to the proposed rules, as discussed in more\ndetail below.20 The Commission\u2019s Small Business Capital Formation Advisory Committee made\nseveral recommendations, including that the Commission exempt emerging growth companies\n18 See infra section I.B.\n19 These comments are available at https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-10-22/s71022.htm. Unless otherwise\nnoted, comments referenced in this release pertain to these comments.\n20 See U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Investor Advisory Committee Recommendation Related to\nClimate-Related Disclosure Rule Proposals (Sept. 21, 2022), available at\nhttps://www.sec.gov/spotlight/investor-advisory-committee-2012/20220921-climate-related-disclosure-\nrecommendation.pdf \u201cIAC Recommendation\u201d). Specifically, the Investor Advisory Committee\nrecommended the following changes to the proposed rules, as discussed in more detail in section II below:\n(1) adding a requirement for \u201cManagement Discussion of Climate-Related Risks & Opportunities\u201d; (2)\nrequiring disclosure of material facility locations; and (3) eliminating the proposed requirement around\nboard expertise. In addition to the IAC Recommendation, in June 2022, the Investor Advisory Committee\nheld a meeting that included a panel discussion regarding climate disclosures. See the minutes for that\nmeeting, including the panelists that participated in the discussion, at\nhttps://www.sec.gov/spotlight/investor-advisory-committee-2012/iac060922-minutes.pdf. The Investor\nAdvisory Committee was established in Apr. 2012 pursuant to section 911 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act [Pub. L. 111-203, sec. 911, 124 Stat. 1376, 1822 (2010)] (\u201cDodd-\nFrank Act\u201d) to advise and make recommendations to the Commission on regulatory priorities, the\nregulation of securities products, trading strategies, fee structures, the effectiveness of disclosure, and\ninitiatives to protect investor interests and to promote investor confidence and the integrity of the securities\nmarketplace.\n16\n\n(\u201cEGCs\u201d)21 and smaller reporting companies (\u201cSRCs\u201d)22 from the final rules or otherwise adopt\nscaled climate-related disclosure requirements for EGCs and SRCs.23 We considered comments\nthat were supportive as well as those that were critical of aspects of the proposed rules, including\n21 An EGC is a registrant that had total annual gross revenues of less than $1.235 billion during its most\nrecently completed fiscal year and has not met the specified conditions for no longer being considered an\nEGC. See 17 CFR 230.405; 17 CFR 240.12b-2; 15 U.S.C. 77b(a)(19); 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(80); and Inflation\nAdjustments under Titles I and III of the JOBS Act, Release No. 33-11098 (Sep. 9, 2022) [87 FR 57394\n(Sep. 20, 2022)].\n22 An SRC is an issuer that is not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer (as defined in 17 CFR\n229.1101), or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent that is not an SRC and that: (1) had a public float of\nless than $250 million; or (2) had annual revenues of less than $100 million and either: (i) no public float;\nor (ii) a public float of less than $700 million. 17 CFR 229.10 (defining SRC and also providing how and\nwhen an issuer determines whether it qualifies as an SRC); 17 CFR 230.405 (same); 17 CFR 240.12b-2\n(same).\n23 See U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Small Business Capital Formation Advisory Committee\nRecommendation Regarding the Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for\nInvestors (July 13, 2022), available at https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/sbcfac/sbcfac-climate-related-\ndisclosures-recommendation-050622.pdf (\u201cSBCFAC Recommendation\u201d). In addition, the Small Business\nCapital Formation Advisory Committee highlights generally in its parting perspectives letter that\n\u201cexemptions, scaling, and phase-ins for new requirements where appropriate, allows smaller companies to\nbuild their businesses and balance the needs of companies and investors while promoting strong and\neffective U.S. public markets.\u201d See Parting Perspectives Letter, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\nSmall Business Capital Formation Advisory Committee (Feb. 28, 2023), available at\nhttps://www.sec.gov/files/committee-perspectives-letter-022823.pdf. Finally, we note that participants in\nthe Commission-hosted Small Business Forum in 2023 recommended that the Commission revise the\nproposed rules to exempt SRCs, non-accelerated filers, EGCs, and other midsized companies and to\nconsider scaling and delayed compliance (\u201cSmall Business Forum Recommendation (2023)\u201d); participants\nin 2022 and 2021 Small Business Forums similarly recommended the Commission provide exemptions or\nscaled requirements for small and medium-sized companies in connection with any new ESG disclosure\nrequirements adopted by the Commission. See Report on the 42nd Annual Small Business Forum (April\n2023), available at https://www.sec.gov/files/2023_oasb_annual_forum_report_508.pdf; Report on the 41st\nAnnual Small Business Forum (April 2022), available at https://www.sec.gov/files/2022-oasb-annual-\nforum-report.pdf; and Report on the 40th Annual Small Business Forum (May 2021), available at\nhttps://www.sec.gov/files/2021_OASB_Annual_Forum_Report_FINAL_508.pdf.

After considering all\ncomments, we are adopting final rules with modifications from the proposal to better effectuate\nour goals in requiring these additional disclosures while limiting the final rules\u2019 burdens on\nregistrants.24\nAs the Commission explained when proposing the climate disclosure rules,25 while\nclimate-related issues are subject to various other regulatory schemes, our objective is limited to\nadvancing the Commission\u2019s mission to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient\nmarkets, and promote capital formation by providing disclosure to investors of information\nimportant to their investment and voting decisions. We are adopting the final rules to advance\nthese investor protection, market efficiency and capital formation objectives, consistent with our\nstatutory authority, and not to address climate-related issues more generally. The final rules\nshould be read in that context. Thus, for example, in those instances where the rules reference\nmateriality\u2014consistent with our existing disclosure rules and market practices\u2014materiality\nrefers to the importance of information to investment and voting decisions about a particular\ncompany, not to the importance of the information to climate-related issues outside of those\ndecisions. The Commission has been and remains agnostic about whether or how registrants\nconsider or manage climate-related risks. Investors have expressed a need for this information\non risks in valuing the securities they currently hold or are considering purchasing. While we\nrecognize that the rules will impose burdens on registrants, we note that the degree of that burden\n24 See infra section I.B for a summary of changes from the proposed rules, including the addition of\nmateriality qualifiers in certain rule provisions and revisions to make the final rules less prescriptive.\n25 See Proposing Release, section I.\n18"

Moreover, as discussed\nfurther throughout the release, we believe that those burdens are justified by the informational\nbenefits of the disclosures to investors.\nA. Need for Enhanced and Standardized Climate-Related Disclosures\nThe importance of climate-related disclosures for investors has grown as investors,26\ncompanies, and the markets have recognized that climate-related risks27 can affect a company\u2019s\nbusiness and its current and longer-term financial performance and position in numerous ways.28\n26 Throughout this release, we refer to investors to include retail investors, institutional investors, and other\nmarket participants (such as financial analysts, investment advisers, and portfolio managers) that use\ndisclosures in Commission filings as part of their analysis and to help investors.\n27 The Commission has a long history of requiring disclosures to investors of information about risks facing\nregistrants. See infra notes 184-191 and accompany text for a discussion of that history. In that time, the\nCommission has described those risks using differently terminology, but has largely focused on the same\nconcepts. See, e.g., 17 CFR 229.105(a) (Where appropriate, provide under the caption \u201cRisk Factors\u201d a\ndiscussion of the material factors that make an investment in the registrant or offering speculative or\nrisky.); Disclosure of Accounting Policies for Derivative Financial Instruments and Derivative Commodity\nInstruments and Disclosure of Quantitative and Qualitative Information About Market Risk Inherent in\nDerivative Financial Instruments, Other Financial Instruments, and Derivative Commodity Instruments,\nRelease No. 33-7386 (Jan. 31, 1997) [62 FR 6044 at n.12 (Feb. 10, 1997)] (Requiring disclosure of\nqualitative and quantitative information about market risk for derivatives and other financial instruments;\nMarket risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates,\nforeign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and other relevant market rate or price changes (e.g.,\nequity prices).); Guides for Preparation and Filing of Registration Statements, Release No. 33-4666 (Feb.\n7, 1964) [29 FR 2490, 2492 (Feb. 15, 1964)] (In many instances the securities to be offered are of a highly\nspeculative nature. The speculative nature may be due to such factors as an absence of operating history of\nthe registrant, an absence of profitable operations in recent periods, the financial position of the registrant\nor the nature of the business in which the registrant is engaged or proposes to engage. . . In such instances,\nand particularly where a lengthy prospectus cannot be avoided, there should be set forth immediately\nfollowing the cover page of the prospectus a carefully organized series of short, concise paragraphs\nsummarizing the principal factors which make the offering speculative with references to other parts of the\nprospectus where complete information with respect to such factors is set forth.).\n28 For example, FSOC\u2019s Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk 2021 found that investors and businesses\nmay experience direct financial effects from climate-related risks and observed that the costs would likely\nbe broadly felt as they are passed through supply chains and to customers and as they reduce firms\u2019 ability\nto service debt or produce returns for investors. See 2021 FSOC Report, Chapter 1: From Climate-Related\nPhysical Risks to Financial Risks; From Climate-related Transition Risks to Financial Risks. In 2023\nFSOC repeated its concern that climate-related risks are an emerging and increasing threat to U.S. financial\nstability and stated that climate-related financial risk can manifest as and amplify traditional risks, such as\n19\n\nClimate-related natural disasters can damage issuers\u2019 assets, disrupt their operations, and\nincrease their costs.29 Any widespread market-based transition to lower carbon products,\npractices, and services\u2014triggered, for example, by recent or future changes in consumer\npreferences30 or the availability of financing, technology, and other market forces31\u2014can lead to\nmaterial changes in a company\u2019s business model or strategy and may have a material impact on a\nregistrant\u2019s financial condition or operations.32\nIn addition to these market forces, changes in law, regulation, or policy may prompt\ncompanies to transition to lower carbon products, practices, and services. For example,\ngovernments including the United States and others throughout the world have made public\ncommitments to transition to a lower carbon economy.33 Efforts towards meeting GHG\ncredit, market, liquidity, operational, compliance, reputational, and legal risks.

Those assessments can, in turn, inform\ninvestment and voting decisions.\nWe agree with the many commenters that stated that the current state of climate-related\ndisclosure has resulted in inconsistent, difficult to compare, and frequently boilerplate\ndisclosures, and has therefore proven inadequate to meet the growing needs of investors for more\ndetailed, consistent, reliable, and comparable information about climate-related effects on a\nregistrant\u2019s business and financial condition to use in making their investment and voting\ndecisions.38 Since the Commission issued the 2010 Guidance, awareness of climate-related risks\n37 See, e.g., infra notes 99-106 and accompanying text.\n38 See, e.g., letters from AllianceBernstein; BlackRock, Inc.

Summary of the Final Rules\nHaving considered the comments received on the proposal, we are adopting the final\namendments described in this release with modifications in response to those comments.45\nLike the proposed rules, the final rules\u2019 reporting framework has structural elements,\ndefinitions, concepts, and, in some cases, substantive requirements that are similar to those in the\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (\u201cTCFD\u201d), an industry-led task force\ncharged with promoting better-informed investment, credit, and insurance underwriting\ndecisions.46 The TCFD reporting framework was designed to elicit information to help investors\nbetter understand a registrant\u2019s climate-related risks to make more informed investment\n44 See, e.g., letters from Calvert; Ceres; Investment Adviser Association (June 17, 2022) (\u201cIAA\u201d); and\nPIMCO.

Nevertheless, considering the overlapping content and themes in the comments, and\nfor the sake of clarity, we have not cited each individual comment letter in support of or against a particular\nposition in the discussion below.\n46 See TCFD, Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (June 2017),\navailable at https://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/60/2020/10/FINAL-2017-TCFD-Report-11052018.pdf.\nIn Apr. 2015, the Group of 20 Finance Ministers directed the Financial Stability Board (\u201cFSB\u201d) to evaluate\nways in which the financial sector could address climate-related concerns. The FSB concluded that better\ninformation was needed to facilitate informed investment decisions and to help investors and other market\nparticipants to better understand and take into account climate-related risks. The FSB established the\nTCFD. Since then, the framework for climate-related disclosures developed by the TCFD has been refined\nand garnered global support as a reliable framework for climate-related financial reporting. For\nbackground on the TCFD and development of its recommendations, see Proposing Release, section I.D.1.\n24\n\ndecisions.47 We therefore find that it is an appropriate reference point for the final rules. Indeed,\nthe core categories of the framework, which focus on governance, risk management, strategy,\nand metrics,48 align with the type of information called for by existing disclosure requirements\nwithin Regulation S-K.49 Accordingly, where consistent with our objectives, the authority\nCongress granted, and the comments received, certain provisions in the final rules are similar to\nthe TCFD recommendations.50 Similarly, we have used concepts developed by the GHG\nProtocol for aspects of the final rules, as it has become a leading reporting standard for GHG\nemissions.51 Because many registrants have elected to follow the TCFD recommendations when\nvoluntarily providing climate-related disclosures,52 and/or have relied on the GHG Protocol\n47 See TCFD, supra note 46, at ii-iii.\n48 See TCFD, supra note 46 (listing governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets as core\nelements of the TCFD framework).\n49 See, e.g., 17 CFR 229.105 (Risk factors), 17 CFR 229.303 (Management\u2019s discussion and analysis of\nfinancial condition and results of operation), 17 CFR 229.401 (Directors, executive officers, promoters and\ncontrol persons), and 17 CFR 229.407 (Corporate governance).\n50 As discussed below, a number of commenters recommended that the Commission incorporate the TCFD\nrecommendations into the final rules. See infra notes 115-118 and accompanying text.\n51 See World Business Council for Sustainable Development and World Resources Institute, The Greenhouse\nGas Protocol, A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard REVISED EDITION, available at\nhttps://ghgprotocol.org/corporate-standard. The GHG Protocol was created through a partnership between\nthe World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, which agreed\nin 1997 to collaborate with businesses and NGOs to create a standardized GHG accounting methodology.\nSee Greenhouse Gas Protocol, About Us, available at https://ghgprotocol.org/about-us. The GHG Protocol,\nwhich is subject to updates periodically, has been broadly incorporated into various sustainability reporting\nframeworks, including the TCFD.\n52 See, e.g., infra note 2690 and accompanying text (describing a report finding that 50 percent of\nsustainability reports from Russell 1000 companies aligned with the TCFD recommendations). In addition,\nmany registrants submit climate disclosures to the CDP, formerly known as the \u201cCarbon Disclosure\nProject,\u201d which is aligned with the TCFD framework. See CDP Worldwide (\u201cCDP\u201d), How CDP is aligned\nto the TCFD, available at https://www.cdp.net/en/guidance/how-cdp-is-aligned-to-the-tcfd (last visited Feb.\n21, 2024); CDP, How companies can take action, available at https://www.cdp.net/en/companies (noting\nthat \u201c23,000+ companies representing two thirds of global market capitalization disclosed through CDP in\n2023\u201d); see also CDP, About us, available at https://www.cdp.net/en/info/about-us (\u201cCDP is a not-for-profit\ncharity that runs the global disclosure system for investors, companies, cities, states and regions to manage\ntheir environmental impacts. . . .

Content of the Climate-Related Disclosures\nThe final rules will create a new subpart 1500 of Regulation S-K and Article 14 of\nRegulation S-X. In particular, the final rules will require a registrant to disclose information\nabout the following items:\n\u2022 Any climate-related risks identified by the registrant that have had or are reasonably\nlikely to have a material impact on the registrant, including on its strategy, results of\noperations, or financial condition in the short-term (i.e., the next 12 months) and in the\nlong-term (i.e., beyond the next 12 months);56\n53 See infra section II.A; and Proposing Release, section I.D.2; see also infra note 2621 (noting that, in the\nU.S. and other jurisdictions, GHG emissions quantification and reporting are generally based on the GHG\nProtocol).\n54 See infra note 2760 and accompanying text.\n55 Cf. infra notes 2568-2570 and accompanying text.\n56 See infra section II.D.1.\n26\n\n\u2022 The actual and potential material impacts of any identified climate-related risks on the\nregistrant\u2019s strategy, business model, and outlook, including, as applicable, any material\nimpacts on a non-exclusive list of items;57\n\u2022 If, as part of its strategy, a registrant has undertaken activities to mitigate or adapt to a\nmaterial climate-related risk, a quantitative and qualitative description of material\nexpenditures incurred and material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions that,\nin management\u2019s assessment, directly result from such mitigation or adaptation\nactivities;58\n\u2022 If a registrant has adopted a transition plan to manage a material transition risk, a\ndescription of the transition plan, and updated disclosures in the subsequent years\ndescribing the actions taken during the year under the plan, including how the actions\nhave impacted the registrant\u2019s business, results of operations, or financial condition, and\nquantitative and qualitative disclosure of material expenditures incurred and material\nimpacts on financial estimates and assumptions as a direct result of the disclosed\nactions;59\n\u2022 If a registrant uses scenario analysis and, in doing so, determines that a climate-related\nrisk is reasonably likely to have a material impact on its business, results of operations, or\nfinancial condition, certain disclosures regarding such use of scenario analysis;60\n57 See infra sections II.D.1. That non-exclusive list is comprised of the registrant\u2019s: (1) business operations,\nincluding the types and locations of its operations, (2) products and services, (3) suppliers, purchasers, or\ncounterparties to material contracts, to the extent known or reasonably available, (4) activities to mitigate or\nadapt to climate-related risks, including adoption of new technologies or processes, and (5) expenditure for\nresearch and development.\n58 See infra sections II.D.1.\n59 See infra section II.D.2.\n60 See infra section II.D.3.\n27\n\n\u2022 If a registrant\u2019s use of an internal carbon price is material to how it evaluates and\nmanages a material climate-related risk, certain disclosures about the internal carbon\nprice;61\n\u2022 Any oversight by the board of directors of climate-related risks and any role by\nmanagement in assessing and managing the registrant\u2019s material climate-related risks;62\n\u2022 Any processes the registrant has for identifying, assessing, and managing material\nclimate-related risks and, if the registrant is managing those risks, whether and how any\nsuch processes are integrated into the registrant\u2019s overall risk management system or\nprocesses;63\n\u2022 If a registrant has set a climate-related target or goal that has materially affected or is\nreasonably likely to materially affect the registrant\u2019s business, results of operations, or\nfinancial condition, certain disclosures about such target or goal, including material\nexpenditures and material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions as a direct\nresult of the target or goal or actions taken to make progress toward meeting such target\nor goal;64\n61 See infra section II.D.4.\n62 See infra section II.E.\n63 See infra section II.F.\n64 See infra section II.G.\n28\n\n\u2022 If a registrant is a large accelerated filer (\u201cLAF\u201d),65 or an accelerated filer (\u201cAF\u201d)66 that is\nnot otherwise exempted, and its Scope 1 emissions and/or its Scope 2 emissions metrics\nare material, certain disclosure about those emissions;67\n\u2022 The capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses incurred as a result of\nsevere weather events and other natural conditions, such as hurricanes, tornadoes,\nflooding, drought, wildfires, extreme temperatures, and sea level rise, subject to\napplicable one percent and de minimis disclosure thresholds;68\n\u2022 The capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, and losses related to carbon offsets and\nrenewable energy credits or certificates (\u201cRECs\u201d) if used as a material component of a\nregistrant\u2019s plans to achieve its disclosed climate-related targets or goals; and69\n65 An LAF is an issuer after it first meets the following conditions as of the end of its fiscal year: (i) the issuer\nhad an aggregate worldwide market value of the voting and non-voting common equity held by its non-\naffiliates of $700 million or more, as of the last business day of the issuer\u2019s most recently completed second\nfiscal quarter; (ii) the issuer has been subject to the requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange\nAct for a period of at least twelve calendar months; (iii) the issuer has filed at least one annual report\npursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act; and (iv) the issuer is not eligible to use the\nrequirements for SRCs under the revenue test in paragraph (2) or (3)(iii)(B) of the SRC definition in Rule\n12b-2. 17 CFR 240.12b-2 (defining LAF and providing how and when an issuer determines whether it\nqualifies as an LAF).\n66 An AF is an issuer after it first meets the following conditions as of the end of its fiscal year: (i) the issuer\nhad an aggregate worldwide market value of the voting and non-voting common equity held by its non-\naffiliates of $75 million or more, but less than $700 million, as of the last business day of the issuer\u2019s most\nrecently completed second fiscal quarter; (ii) the issuer has been subject to the requirements of Section\n13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act for a period of at least twelve calendar months; and (iii) the issuer has\nfiled at least one annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act; and (iv) the issuer is\nnot eligible to use the requirements for SRCs under the revenue test in paragraph (2) or (3)(iii)(B) of the\nSRC definition in Rule 12b-2. 17 CFR 240.12b-2 (defining AF and providing how and when an issuer\ndetermines whether it qualifies as an AF).\n67 See infra section II.H. The final rules define the terms \u201cScope 1 emissions\u201d (direct GHG emissions from\noperations that are owned or controlled by a registrant) and \u201cScope 2 emissions\u201d (indirect GHG emissions\nfrom the generation of purchased or acquired electricity, steam, heat, or cooling that is consumed by\noperations owned or controlled by a registrant).\n68 See infra section II.K.\n69 See infra section II.K.\n29\n\n\u2022 If the estimates and assumptions a registrant uses to produce the financial statements\nwere materially impacted by risks and uncertainties associated with severe weather\nevents and other natural conditions, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding, drought,\nwildfires, extreme temperatures, and sea level rise, or any disclosed climate-related\ntargets or transition plans, a qualitative description of how the development of such\nestimates and assumptions was impacted.70\nIn addition, under the final rules, a registrant that is required to disclose Scopes 1 and/or 2\nemissions and is an LAF or AF must file an attestation report in respect of those emissions\nsubject to phased in compliance dates. An AF must file an attestation report at the limited\nassurance level beginning the third fiscal year after the compliance date for disclosure of GHG\nemissions. An LAF must file an attestation report at the limited assurance level beginning the\nthird fiscal year after the compliance date for disclosure of GHG emissions, and then file an\nattestation report at the reasonable assurance level beginning the seventh fiscal year after the\ncompliance date for disclosure of GHG emissions. The final rules also require a registrant that is\nnot required to disclose its GHG emissions or to include a GHG emissions attestation report\npursuant to the final rules to disclose certain information if the registrant voluntarily discloses its\nGHG emissions in a Commission filing and voluntarily subjects those disclosures to third-party\nassurance.\nThe final rules reflect a number of modifications to the proposed rules based on the\ncomments we received. As discussed in more detail below, we have revised the proposed rules\nin several respects, including by:\n70 See infra section II.K.\n30\n\n\u2022 Adopting a less prescriptive approach to certain of the final rules, including, for example,\nthe climate-related risk disclosure, board oversight disclosure, and risk management\ndisclosure requirements;71\n\u2022 Qualifying the requirements to provide certain climate-related disclosures based on\nmateriality, including, for example, disclosures regarding impacts of climate-related\nrisks, use of scenario analysis, and maintained internal carbon price;\n\u2022 Eliminating the proposed requirement to describe board members\u2019 climate expertise;\n\u2022 Eliminating the proposed requirement for all registrants to disclose Scope 1 and Scope 2\nemissions and instead requiring such disclosure only for LAFs and AFs, on a phased in\nbasis, and only when those emissions are material and with the option to provide the\ndisclosure on a delayed basis;\n\u2022 Exempting SRCs and EGCs from the Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions disclosure\nrequirement;\n\u2022 Modifying the proposed assurance requirement covering Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions\nfor AFs and LAFs by extending the reasonable assurance phase in period for LAFs and\nrequiring only limited assurance for AFs;\n\u2022 Eliminating the proposed requirement to provide Scope 3 emissions disclosure (which the\nproposal would have required in certain circumstances);\n\u2022 Removing the requirement to disclose the impact of severe weather events and other\nnatural conditions and transition activities on each line item of a registrant\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial statements;\n71 See infra sections II.C.1.c, II.E.1.c, and II.F.3 for discussions of how we made these disclosure\nrequirements less prescriptive as compared to the proposed rules.\n31\n\n\u2022 Focusing the required disclosure of financial statement effects on capitalized costs,\nexpenditures expensed, charges, and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events\nand other natural conditions in the notes to the financial statements;\n\u2022 Requiring disclosure of material expenditures directly related to climate-related activities\nas part of a registrant\u2019s strategy, transition plan and/or targets and goals disclosure\nrequirements under subpart 1500 of Regulation S-K rather than under Article 14 of\nRegulation S-X;\n\u2022 Extending a safe harbor from private liability for certain disclosures, other than historic\nfacts, pertaining to a registrant\u2019s transition plan, scenario analysis, internal carbon\npricing, and targets and goals;72\n\u2022 Eliminating the proposal to require a private company that is a party to a business\ncombination transaction, as defined by Securities Act Rule 165(f), registered on Form S-4\nor F-4 to provide the subpart 1500 and Article 14 disclosures;\n\u2022 Eliminating the proposed requirement to disclose any material change to the climate-\nrelated disclosures provided in a registration statement or annual report in a Form 10-Q\n(or, in certain circumstances, Form 6-K for a registrant that is a foreign private issuer that\ndoes not report on domestic forms); and\n\u2022 Extending certain phase in periods.\n72 In addition, the existing safe harbors for forward-looking statements under the Securities Act and Exchange\nAct will be available for other aspects of the climate-related disclosures.

Consistent, Comparable, and Reliable Disclosures for Investors\nThe Commission proposed the climate-related disclosure rules in order to elicit more\nconsistent, comparable, and reliable information for investors to enable them to make informed\nassessments of the impact of climate-related risks on current and potential investments.89\nAccordingly, the Commission proposed to amend Regulation S-K to add a new subpart 1500 that\nwould require a registrant to disclose: any material climate-related impacts on its strategy,\nbusiness model, and outlook; its governance of climate-related risks; its climate-related risk\nmanagement; GHG emissions metrics; and climate-related targets and goals, if any.90\nThe Commission also proposed to amend Regulation S-X to add a new article (Article\n14), which would have required a registrant to disclose in a note to its financial statements\ncertain disaggregated climate-related financial statement metrics.91 The proposed rules would\nhave required disclosure falling under the following three categories of information: financial\nimpact metrics; expenditure metrics; and financial estimates and assumptions. The Commission\nproposed the financial statement metrics requirement to increase transparency about how\nclimate-related risks impact a registrant\u2019s financial statements.92 Under the proposed\namendments to both Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X, disclosure of climate-related\nopportunities would be optional.\n89 See Proposing Release, section I.B.\n90 See id.\n91 See id.\n92 See Proposing Release, section II.A.1.\n36"

The Commission indicated that this should help to mitigate both the compliance\nburden for registrants and any burdens faced by investors in analyzing the new disclosures and\nwould facilitate comparability across registrants.95\nb. Proposed Location of the Disclosure\nIn proposing to include the climate-related disclosure rules in Regulation S-K and\nRegulation S-X, the Commission stated its belief that the proposed disclosure would be\nfundamental to investors\u2019 understanding of the nature of a registrant\u2019s business and its operating\nprospects and financial performance and, therefore, should be presented together with other\ndisclosure about the registrant\u2019s business and financial condition.96 The Commission proposed\nto require a registrant to include the climate-related disclosure in Securities Act or Exchange Act\nregistration statements and Exchange Act annual reports in a separately captioned \u201cClimate-\nRelated Disclosure\u201d section and in the financial statements. The Commission stated that the\nproposed presentation would facilitate review of the climate-related disclosure by investors\n93 See supra section I.B.\n94 See TCFD, supra note 46, at iv.\n95 See Proposing Release, section II.A.1.\n96 See Proposing Release, section II.A.2.\n37"

This commenter, among others, stated that requiring the use of, or basing the\nCommission\u2019s climate disclosure rules on, the ISSB climate reporting standard would contribute\nsubstantially to the establishment of a global climate disclosure baseline, which would reduce the\nreporting burden on companies listed in multiple jurisdictions.120 Some commenters, however,\nopposed basing the Commission\u2019s climate disclosure rules on the TCFD framework. One\ncommenter stated that the Commission should not base its rules on a disclosure framework, such\nas the TCFD framework, that has not been developed by a U.S. regulatory agency because there\nis no process in place for domestic companies, such as oil and gas companies, to provide their\ninput into potential changes to the framework.121 Another commenter stated that the\nCommission should not base its climate disclosure rules on the TCFD because, in its view, there\nis currently no third-party framework, including the TCFD, capable of providing reliable and\nconsistent metrics for climate-related risks.122 A different commenter disputed that U.S.\n118 See, e.g., letters from Alphabet et al.; Eni SpA; Harvard Mgmt.; PRI; and Unilever.\n119 See letter from CalSTRS.\n120 See id.; see also letters from Douglas Hileman Consulting LLC (May 2, 2022) (\u201cD.

Many commenters supported the proposed placement of climate-related\ndisclosure rules in a new subpart of Regulation S-K and the placement of the proposed financial\nmetrics in a new article of Regulation S-X.124 Commenters stated that amending Regulation S-K\nand Regulation S-X to include climate-related disclosure requirements would facilitate the\npresentation of climate-related business and financial information as part of a registrant\u2019s regular\nbusiness reporting125 and appropriately reflect the fact that information about climate-related\nrisks is essential to investors\u2019 decision-making and fundamental to understanding the nature of a\ncompany\u2019s operating prospects and financial performance.126 Commenters further stated that\nrequiring climate-related disclosures in annual filings, including the notes to the financial\nstatements, would enhance the accessibility, comparability, and reliability of such disclosures for\ninvestors.127\nMany other commenters, however, opposed adoption of the proposed financial metrics\nunder Regulation S-X because of various concerns relating to implementation and interpretation\n123 See letter from Western Midstream Partners, LP (June 15, 2022) (\u201cWestern Midstream\u201d).\n124 See, e.g., letters from Amer. for Fin.

Several\ncommenters supported the proposed placement because it would facilitate access to and\ncomparability of the climate-related disclosures for investors.130 Commenters also supported the\nproposed alternative to permit registrants to incorporate by reference climate-related disclosures\nfrom other sections of a filing or from other filings because it would avoid duplication in the\nfiling, would add flexibility regarding the presentation of the disclosures, and would be\nconsistent with the Commission\u2019s incorporation by reference rules regarding other types of\ndisclosure.131 Some of the commenters specifically recommended allowing registrants to include\n128 See, e.g., letters from ABA; AllianceBernstein; Alphabet et al.; BOA; BlackRock; Business Roundtable;\nCleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP (June 16, 2022) (\u201cCleary Gottlieb\u201d); FedEx Corporation (June 17,\n2022) (\u201cFedEx\u201d); General Motors Company (June 17, 2022) (\u201cGM\u201d); Grant Thornton LLP (June 17, 2022)\n(\u201cGrant Thornton\u201d); National Association of Manufacturers (June 6, 2022) (\u201cNAM\u201d); Securities Industry\nand Financial Markets Association (June 17, 2022) (\u201cSIFMA\u201d); Soc.

The Commission also stated in the Proposing\nRelease that, as part of its filing review process, Commission staff had assessed the extent to which\nregistrants currently disclose climate-related risks in their filings. Proposing Release at 21339. The staff\nnoted that, since 2010, disclosures climate-related disclosures have generally increased, but there is\nconsiderable variation in the content, detail, and location (i.e., in reports filed with the Commission, in\nsustainability reports posted on registrant websites, or elsewhere) of climate-related disclosures. Id. The\nstaff also observed significant inconsistency in the depth and specificity of disclosures by registrants across\nindustries and within the same industry. Id. The staff found significantly more extensive information in\nregistrants\u2019 sustainability reports and other locations such as their websites as compared with their reports\nfiled with the Commission. Id. In addition, the disclosures in registrants\u2019 Forms 10-K frequently contained\ngeneral, boilerplate discussions that provide limited information as to the registrants\u2019 assessment of their\nclimate-related risks or their impact on the companies\u2019 business.

Moreover, although the 2010 Guidance reflects that\nclimate-related information may be called for by current Commission disclosure requirements,\nclimate-related information has often been provided outside of Commission filings, such as in\nsustainability reports or other documents posted on registrants\u2019 websites, which are not subject to\nstandardized disclosure rules, and, as noted by some commenters, are not necessarily prepared\nwith the informational needs of investors in mind.140 Such information also may not be prepared\n(\u201cAmer. for Fin.

In addition, the Commission received many unique letters from\nindividual investors expressing their support for the proposed rules, with several stating that there was a\nneed for more consistent and comparable disclosure about climate-related risk from registrants. See, e.g.,\nletters from Kim Leslie Shafer (June 16, 2022) (\u201c[A]s an investor and a citizen, I support the SEC\nprescribing consistent, comparable, reliable and mandatory disclosure of climate-related information.\u201d);\nNeetin Gulati (June 17, 2022); Sandy Spears (June 16, 2022); R. Palacios.\n140 See letter from PwC (expressing concern about permitting registrants to incorporate by reference from their\nsustainability reports or corporate responsibility reports because such reports \u201cmay be prepared using a\nbasis of presentation designed for a stakeholder group with different information needs than investors and\nother providers of capital\u201d).\n48\n\nwith the same level of rigor that results from the disclosure controls and procedures (\u201cDCP\u201d)\nrequired for disclosure in Commission filings,141 and as a result may not be as reliable.142\nConsistent with and as authorized by our enabling statutes, we are adopting the climate-\nrelated disclosure requirements discussed herein, so that investors will have the information they\nneed to make informed investment and voting decisions by evaluating a registrant\u2019s exposure to\nmaterial climate-related risks. We modeled the proposed disclosure requirements in large part on\nthe TCFD framework. As discussed in the Proposing Release and as many commenters noted,\nthat framework has been widely accepted by issuers and investors.143 The TCFD framework\nfocuses on matters that are material to an investment or voting decision and is grounded in\nconcepts that tie climate-related risk disclosure considerations to matters that may affect the\nresults of operations, financial condition, or business strategy of a registrant. Because the TCFD\nframework is intended to elicit disclosure of climate-related risks that have materially affected or\nare reasonably likely to materially affect the business, results of operations, or financial\ncondition of a company, it served as an appropriate model for the Commission\u2019s proposed\nclimate-related disclosure rules. We therefore disagree with commenters that stated that the\nCommission\u2019s proposed rules would require disclosure of information that is primarily of general\n141 See Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 [17 CFR 240.13a-15 and 17 CFR 240.15d-15]. Pursuant to Exchange\nAct Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, a company\u2019s principal executive officer and principal financial officer must\nmake certifications regarding the maintenance and effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures.\nThese rules define \u201cdisclosure controls and procedures\u201d as those controls and procedures designed to\nensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under\nthe Exchange Act is (1) \u201crecorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified\nin the Commission\u2019s rules and forms,\u201d and (2) \u201caccumulated and communicated to the company\u2019s\nmanagement \u2026 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\u201d\n142 See, e.g., letter from Ceres; see also letter from Calvert (stating that \u201cwe believe the disclosures mandated\nby the SEC in the proposed rule should be filed in annual reports, as well as quarterly reports where\nappropriate\u201d because \u201cit is supported by disclosure controls, CEO/CFO certification, audit requirements\nand a level of scrutiny by management appropriate for climate risks\u201d).\n143 See supra notes 115 and 116 and accompanying text.\n49\n\nor environmental interest and not of financial interest.144 The final rules continue to reflect many\nof the TCFD\u2019s recommendations, modified based on the input of commenters, which will\nenhance the usefulness and comparability of the required climate-related disclosures for\ninvestors and better serve their informational needs when making investment and voting\ndecisions.145\nAt the same time, in consideration of some commenters\u2019 concerns,146 we have revised the\nproposed climate-related disclosure requirements in certain respects to reduce the likelihood that\nthe final rules result in disclosures that could be less useful for investors and costly for registrants\nto produce and to provide added flexibility for registrants regarding the content and presentation\nof the disclosure. Modeling the climate-related disclosure requirements on the TCFD framework\nwhile also adopting these revisions will help mitigate the compliance burden of the final rules,\nparticularly for registrants that are already providing climate-related disclosures based on the\nTCFD framework or soon will be doing so pursuant to other laws or regulations.147\nIn this regard, we note certain ongoing developments related to climate-risk reporting:\n144 See supra note 111 and accompanying text.\n145 See supra note 107 and accompanying text.\n146 See, e.g., supra note 109 and accompanying text.\n147 See supra sections I.B. In this regard, we note that some commenters recommended that the Commission\nrequire or allow the use of the ISSB\u2019s climate-related disclosure standards as an alternative to the\nCommission\u2019s climate disclosure rules. See supra note 120 and accompanying text. While we\nacknowledge that there are similarities between the ISSB\u2019s climate-related disclosure standards and the\nfinal rules, and that registrants may operate or be listed in jurisdictions that will adopt or apply the ISSB\nstandards in whole or in part, those jurisdictions have not yet integrated the ISSB standards into their\nclimate-related disclosure rules. Accordingly, at this time we decline to recognize the use of the ISSB\nstandards as an alternative reporting regime.\n50\n\n\u2022 The formation of the ISSB by the IFRS Foundation148 in November 2021, which\nconsolidated several sustainability disclosure organizations into a single\norganization.149 In June 2023, the ISSB issued General Requirements for Disclosure\nof Sustainability-related Financial Information (\u201cIFRS S1\u201d) and Climate-related\nDisclosures (\u201cIFRS S2\u201d).150 Notably, IFRS S1 and S2 integrate the recommendations\nof the TCFD.151\n\u2022 Several jurisdictions have announced plans to adopt, apply, or otherwise be informed\nby the ISSB standards, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Hong Kong, Japan,\nMalaysia, Nigeria, Singapore, and the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d), although it is not yet\n148 The IFRS Foundation refers to the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation, whose mission\nis to develop high-quality IFRS Standards that bring transparency, accountability, and efficiency to\nfinancial markets around the world.

Although the TCFD has disbanded, in this\nrelease we continue to refer to \u201cTCFD recommendations\u201d as distinct from ISSB standards, both for clarity\nand because not all jurisdictions that implemented TCFD-aligned disclosure requirements have\nimplemented the broader and more recent ISSB standards.\n51\n\nclear how specifically the ISSB standards may be incorporated into certain foreign\nlegal frameworks.152\n\u2022 Other jurisdictions were already well advanced in the process of adopting climate\ndisclosure rules when the ISSB standards were announced. For example, in 2022, the\nEuropean Union (\u201cEU\u201d) adopted the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive\n(\u201cCSRD\u201d),153 which requires certain large and listed companies and other entities,\nincluding non-EU entities, to report on sustainability-related issues in line with the\nEuropean Sustainability Reporting Standards (\u201cESRS\u201d).154\n\u2022 California recently adopted the Climate-Related Financial Risk Act (Senate Bill 261),\nwhich will require certain public and private U.S. companies that do business in\n152 For example, the UK has announced that its Sustainability Disclosure Standards (\u201cSDS\u201d) will be based on\nthe ISSB Standards. See Dep\u2019t of Bus. & Trade, UK Sustainability Disclosure Standards, Gov.UK (Aug. 2,\n2023), available at https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-sustainability-disclosure-standards. Australia recently\npublished draft legislation mandating comprehensive climate-related reporting and assurance for large and\nmedium-sized companies that is aligned with the ISSB Standards. See Australian Government-the\nTreasury, Climate-related financial disclosure: exposure draft legislation (Jan. 12, 2024), available at\nhttps://treasury.gov.au/consultation/c2024-466491.\n153 See Directive (EU) 2022/2464 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2022\namending Regulation (EU) No 537/2014, Directive 2004/109/EC, Directive 2006/43/EC and Directive\n2013/34/EU, as regards corporate sustainability reporting (Text with EEA relevance), available at\nhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2022.322.01.0015.01.ENG. In\nadopting the CSRD, the EU explained that there exists a widening gap between the sustainability\ninformation, including climate-related data, companies report and the needs of the intended users of that\ninformation, which may mean that investors are unable to take sufficient account of climate-related risks in\ntheir investment decisions.\n154 See id. The CSRD requires large companies and listed companies to publish regular reports on the social\nand environmental risks they face, and how their activities impact people and the environment. In July\n2023, the European Commission (\u201cEC\u201d) adopted the delegated act containing the first set of ESRS under\nthe CSRD and the ESRS became effective on Jan. 1, 2024, for companies within scope of the first phase of\nreporting under the CSRD.

Separate reporting standards will be developed for SMEs and certain non-EU\ncompanies operating in the EU.

However, the disclosure required by\nthese laws will appear in documents outside of Commission filings and therefore will not be\nsubject to the same liability, DCPs, and other investor protections as the climate-related\ndisclosures required under the final rules. In addition, these laws may serve different purposes\nthan the final rules or apply different materiality or other standards. For example, the California\nlaws were adopted to protect the health and safety of California residents,157 among other\n155 See SB-261, Greenhouse gases: climate-related financial risk (Oct. 7, 2023), available at\nhttps://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB261.\n156 See SB-253, Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act (Oct. 7, 2023), available at\nhttps://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB253. The Act directs the\nCalifornia Air Resources Board (CARB) to adopt regulations to implement the requirements of the Act,\nwith disclosures being required as early as 2026, subject to the CARB\u2019s finalization of the rules. The Act\nfurther requires the disclosure of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions to be subject to assurance, which must be\nperformed at a limited assurance level beginning in 2026 and at a reasonable assurance level beginning in\n2030. See SB-253, section II.c.1.F.ii. The statute is currently subject to litigation. See Compl., Chamber of\nCommerce v. California Air Resources Board, No. 2:24-cv-00801 (D. C.D. Cal. Jan. 30, 2024).\n157 See SB-253, supra note 156, at section 1 (stating that \u201cCalifornians are already facing devastating wildfires,\nsea level rise, drought, and other impacts associated with climate change that threaten the health and safety\nof Californians. . .\u201d).\n53\n\nreasons, whereas we are adopting the final rules to enhance disclosures of emergent risks\ncompanies face so that investors can have the information they need to make informed\ninvestment and voting decisions. Regardless of the extent of overlap with other jurisdictions\u2019\nreporting requirements and consistent with the Commission\u2019s mission, the final rules are tailored\nto the particular needs of investors and the specific situations of Commission registrants, as\ndocumented in the comment file, and are designed to work within the existing framework of U.S.\nsecurities laws that call for disclosure about the material risks that companies face. Integrating\nthe required disclosures into the existing framework of U.S. securities laws will provide\ninvestors with more complete information about a company, the risks it faces, and its business,\nfinances, and results of operations while affording investors the protections of the securities laws\nfor this information.\nWe acknowledge the concerns expressed by some commenters about relying on a third-\nparty framework, such as the TCFD, that may not afford affected parties the ability to provide\ninput on potential future changes.158 While we considered the TCFD framework in both\nproposing and now adopting the Commission\u2019s own climate-related disclosure rules, the final\nrules do not incorporate the TCFD recommendations or its procedures. Any future updates to the\nTCFD framework or any successor framework will have no bearing or impact on the final rules\nwithout future action by the Commission. Any consideration of such updates by the\nCommission will be subject to the Commission\u2019s own procedures, and any subsequent\nrulemaking to reflect those updates will be subject to the Administrative Procedure Act\u2019s\nrequirements, including notice and comment, as well as requirements under other relevant laws.\nThe final rules also do not follow every TCFD recommendation. For example, unlike the TCFD,\n158 See letter from Petrol. OK.\n54\n\nwhich recommends the disclosure of executive compensation that is linked to climate-related risk\nmanagement considerations, we have elected not to include such a requirement in the final rules,\nas discussed below.159\nLike the proposed rules, the final rules amend Regulation S-K by adding a new section\n(subpart 1500) composed of the climate-related disclosure rules, other than for the financial\nstatement disclosures, and Regulation S-X by adding a new article (Article 14) to govern the\nfinancial statement disclosures. We continue to believe that it is appropriate to amend\nRegulation S-K and Regulation S-X to require climate-related disclosures in Securities Act or\nExchange Act registration statements and Exchange Act reports. Information about climate-\nrelated risks and their financial impacts is fundamental in many cases to understanding a\ncompany\u2019s financial condition and operating results and prospects and therefore should be\ntreated like other business and financial information, including information on risks to the\ncompany.160\nThe proposed rules would have required a registrant to include its climate-related\ndisclosures, other than its financial statement disclosures, either in a separately captioned\n\u201cClimate-Related Disclosure\u201d section in the registration statement or Exchange Act annual report\nor in other parts of the Commission filing that would then be incorporated by reference into the\nseparately captioned section. While some commenters supported this proposal because it would\nfacilitate the comparability of the disclosures among registrants,161 other commenters stated that\nexisting parts of the registration statement or annual report could be more appropriate for\n159 See TCFD, Implementing the Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial\nDisclosures (Oct. 2021), available at https://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/60/2021/07/2021-TCFD-\nImplementing_Guidance.pdf; infra section II.E.2.\n160 See supra notes 125 and 126 and accompanying text.\n161 See supra note 130 and accompanying text.\n55\n\nplacement of the climate-related disclosures, and indicated that it should be up to each registrant\nto determine the most suitable place for the disclosures according to the context of the\ndisclosures and structure of the filing.162\nWhile enhancing the comparability of climate-related disclosures remains an important\nobjective of the rulemaking, we also recognize the benefits of granting each registrant sufficient\nflexibility to determine the most appropriate location within a filing for the disclosures based on\nits particular facts and circumstances. Therefore, the final rules leave the placement of the\nclimate-related disclosures, other than the financial statement disclosures, largely up to each\nregistrant. Further, we are adopting as proposed structured data requirements that will enable\nautomated extraction and analysis of the information required by the final rules, further\nfacilitating investors\u2019 ability to identify and compare climate-related disclosures, regardless of\nwhere they are presented.163 A registrant may elect to place most of the subpart 1500 disclosures\nin a separately captioned \u201cClimate-Related Disclosure\u201d section. Alternatively, a registrant may\nelect to include these climate-related disclosures in applicable, currently existing parts of the\nregistration statement or annual report (e.g., Risk Factors, Description of Business, or MD&A).\nIf it chooses the latter alternative, then the registrant should consider whether cross-referencing\nthe other disclosures in the separately captioned section would enhance the presentation of the\nclimate-related disclosures for investors.\nA registrant may also incorporate by reference some of the climate-related disclosures\nfrom other filed registration statements or Exchange Act reports if the incorporated disclosure is\nresponsive to the topics specified in the Regulation S-K climate-related disclosure items and if\n162 See, e.g., letter from Unilever.\n163 See discussion of 17 CFR 229.1508 infra section II.M.\n56\n\nthe registrant satisfies the incorporation by reference requirements under the Commission\u2019s rules\nand forms.164 In addition, any climate-related disclosure that is being incorporated by reference\nmust include electronic tags that meet the final rules\u2019 structured data requirement.165 As\ncommenters noted, allowing incorporation by reference of climate-related disclosures will avoid\nduplication in the filing, add flexibility regarding the presentation of the disclosures, and be\nconsistent with the Commission\u2019s incorporation by reference rules regarding other types of\ndisclosure.166\nSome commenters recommended that we permit a registrant to include disclosure\nregarding its climate-related corporate governance in its proxy statement, together with its\ndiscussion of other corporate governance matters, which would then be incorporated by\nreference into the registrant\u2019s Form 10-K.167 Form 10-K currently permits the incorporation by\nreference pursuant to General Instruction G.3 of certain corporate governance matters from a\nproxy statement involving the election of directors.168 While disclosure pursuant to Item 401 of\nRegulation S-K, which pertains to the identification and business experience of directors and\nexecutive officers, is permitted to be incorporated by reference from the proxy statement,\ndisclosure pursuant to Item 407(h) of Regulation S-K, which pertains to the board\u2019s leadership\nstructure and its role in risk oversight, is not one of the enumerated matters permitted to be\nincorporated by reference from the proxy statement. As discussed below, the final rules do not\ninclude the proposed provisions that would have most likely elicited disclosure drawn from the\n164 See 17 CFR 230.411 and 17 CFR 240.12b-23.\n165 See 17 CFR 229.1508.\n166 See supra note 131 and accompanying text.\n167 See, e.g., letters from Microsoft; and SIFMA.\n168 See General Instruction G.3 of Form 10-K, which pertains to information permitted under Part III of Form\n10-K, including, among other matters, Item 401 and certain provisions of Item 407.\n57\n\ninformation required by Item 401 (i.e., the proposed requirements to identify the board members\nresponsible for the oversight of climate-related risks and to disclose whether any board member\nhas expertise in climate-related risks).169 Additionally, the retained governance provisions of the\nfinal rules require disclosure that is relevant to understanding more generally the board\u2019s\noversight of climate-related risks and management\u2019s role in assessing and managing such risks,\nand do not necessarily pertain to the election of directors. For these reasons, while the final rules\ndo not preclude incorporation by reference from a registrant\u2019s proxy statement to the extent\nallowed by existing rules,170 we decline to expressly permit the disclosure to be incorporated by\nreference from a registrant\u2019s proxy statement pursuant to General Instruction G.3 of Form 10-K.\nPlacement of the new disclosures required by the final rules in Commission filings\nfurther serves our investor protection goals because it will subject these disclosures to DCPs.\nThese controls and procedures will enhance not only the reliability of the climate-related\ndisclosures themselves, including both qualitative climate-related information and quantitative\nclimate-related data, but also their accuracy and consistency.171\n169 See infra section II.E.1.\n170 See supra note 164 and accompanying text.\n171 See supra notes 141-142 and accompanying text. As we have stated before, a company\u2019s disclosure\ncontrols and procedures should not be limited to disclosure specifically required, but should also ensure\ntimely collection and evaluation of \u201cinformation potentially subject to [required] disclosure,\u201d \u201cinformation\nthat is relevant to an assessment of the need to disclose developments and risks that pertain to the\n[company\u2019s] businesses,\u201d and \u201cinformation that must be evaluated in the context of the disclosure\nrequirement of Exchange Act Rule 12b-20.\u201d Certification of Disclosure in Companies\u2019 Quarterly and\nAnnual Reports, Release No. 33-8124 (Aug. 28, 2002) [67 FR 57275 (Sept. 9, 2002)].\n58"

Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, the need for specific\nrules mandating disclosure of information relating to litigation and other business costs arising\nout of compliance with Federal, State, and local laws relating to environmental protection were\nthe subject of several rulemaking efforts, extensive litigation, and public hearings.202 As a result\nof this process, in 1982, the Commission adopted rules that address disclosure of certain\nenvironmental issues.203\nMore recently, the Commission published the 2010 Guidance, explaining how the\nCommission\u2019s existing disclosure rules may require disclosure of the impacts of climate change\n201 In addition to Commission rules requiring disclosures regarding specific elements of the risks facing\nregistrants that are discussed supra notes 192-198 and accompanying text, the Commission has adopted\ndisclosure requirements that are similarly subject to substantive regulation under other statutes and by other\nagencies, as discussed infra note 207.\n202 See Environmental Disclosure, Interpretive Release No. 33-6130 (Sept. 27, 1979) [44 FR 56924 (Oct. 3,\n1979)] (discussing this history); Proposed Amendments to Item 5 of Regulation S -K Regarding Disclosure\nof Certain Environmental Proceedings, Release No. 33-6315 (May 4, 1981) [46 FR 25638]; NRDC v. SEC,\n606 F.2d 1031, 1036-42 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (same).\n203 See 1982 Release (adopting 17 CFR 229.103, which requires a registrant to describe its material pending\nlegal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, and indicating that\nadministrative or judicial proceedings arising under Federal, state, or local law regulating the discharge of\nmaterials into the environment or primarily for the purpose of protecting the environment, shall not be\ndeemed \u201cordinary routine litigation incidental to the business\u201d and must be described if meeting certain\nconditions). The 1982 Release also moved the requirement to disclose information regarding the material\neffects of compliance with Federal, State and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the\nenvironment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, on the registrant\u2019s capital\nexpenditures, earnings and competitive position, as well as the disclosure of its material estimated capital\nexpenditures for environmental control facilities, to 17 CFR 229.101(c)(1)(xii).\n66\n\non a registrant\u2019s business or financial condition.204 And in 2020, the Commission amended its\ndisclosure rules to require, to the extent material to an understanding of the business taken as a\nwhole, disclosure of the material effects that compliance with government regulations, including\nenvironmental regulations, may have upon the capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive\nposition of the registrant and its subsidiaries.205\nSimilarly, the Commission is adopting the final rules based on its determination that the\nrequired disclosures will elicit information that investors have indicated is important to their\ninvestment and voting decisions.206 As explained throughout this release, climate-related risks\ncan affect a company\u2019s business and its financial performance and position in a number of ways.\nA growing number of investors across a broad swath of the market consider information about\nclimate-related risks to be important to their decision-making. These investors have expressed\nthe need for more reliable information about the effects of climate-related and other severe\nweather events or other natural conditions on issuers\u2019 businesses, as well as information about\nhow registrants have considered and addressed climate-related risks when conducting operations\nand developing business strategy and financial plans. These rules respond to this need by\nproviding investors more reliable and decision-useful disclosure of strategies and risks that a\nregistrant has determined will likely materially impact its business, results of operations, or\n204 See 2010 Guidance. As the Commission discussed in the guidance, the agency reviewed its full disclosure\nprogram relating to environmental disclosures in SEC filings in connection with a Government\nAccountability Office review. Among other things, the 2010 Guidance emphasized that climate change\ndisclosure might, depending on the circumstances, be required in a company\u2019s Description of Business,\nRisk Factors, Legal Proceedings, and MD&A; identified certain climate-related issues that companies may\nneed to consider in making their disclosures; and stated that registrants should consider any financial\nstatement implications of climate change issues in accordance with applicable accounting standards.\n205 See Modernization of Regulation S-K Items 101, 103, and 105, Release No. 33-10825 (Aug. 26, 2020) [85\nFR 63726 (Oct. 8, 2020)].\n206 See supra section I.A.\n67\n\nfinancial condition. The disclosure of such information\u2014whether climate-related or otherwise\u2014\nfalls within the authority conferred by Congress in the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.207\nThe Regulation S-X provisions of the final rules are also within the Commission\u2019s\nauthority. In addition to the statutory provisions discussed above, the Federal securities laws\nprovide the Commission with extensive and specific authority to prescribe financial statement\ndisclosures, set accounting standards, and establish accounting principles for entities that file\nfinancial statements with the Commission.\nAs noted above, Section 7(a)(1) of the Securities Act specifies that a registration\nstatement shall contain, among other things, the information specified in Schedule A. Schedule\nA in turn requires disclosure of balance sheet and profit and loss statement (i.e., comprehensive\nincome statement) information \u201cin such detail and in such form as the Commission shall\nprescribe.\u201d208 In addition, Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act provides the Commission with\nspecific authority to require not only balance sheet and income statement disclosure, but also\n\u201cany further financial statements which the Commission may deem necessary or appropriate for\nthe protection of investors.\u201d209\nSection 19(a) of the Securities Act also grants the Commission extensive authority to\n\u201cmake, amend, and rescind such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the\n207 The final rules are also consistent with other disclosure items that are similarly subject to substantive\nregulation under other statutes and by other agencies. For example, banks, bank holding companies,\nsavings and loan associations, and savings and loan holding companies are subject to subpart 1400 of\nRegulation S-K despite the substantive jurisdiction and regulation of other state and Federal prudential\nregulators. Similarly, here, the importance of climate-related risks to investor decision-making makes them\nappropriate for disclosure regardless of other regimes that substantively regulate those issues.\n208 See Schedule A, paras. 25 and 26. The \u201cform\u201d required by the Commission includes both financial\nstatements and notes to those statements. See 17 CFR 210.1-01(b) (specifying the term \u201cfinancial\nstatements\u201d includes all notes to the statements and related schedules).\n209 15 U.S.C. 78l(b)(1)(J) through (L).\n68\n\nprovisions of,\u201d the Securities Act, which includes \u201cdefining accounting, technical, and trade\nterms used in\u201d the Securities Act. \u201cAmong other things,\u201d this section grants the Commission the\nauthority to \u201cprescribe . . . the items or details to be shown in the balance sheet and earning\nstatement, and the methods to be followed in the preparation of accounts, in the appraisal or\nvaluation of assets and liabilities, in the determination of depreciation and depletion, in the\ndifferentiation of recurring and nonrecurring income, in the differentiation of investment and\noperating income, and in the preparation, where the Commission deems it necessary or desirable,\nof consolidated balance sheets or income accounts of any person directly or indirectly controlling\nor controlled by the issuer, or any person under direct or indirect common control with the\nissuer.\u201d210 Sections 13 and 23 of the Exchange Act grant the Commission similar authority with\nrespect to reports filed under that Act.211\nRelying on these provisions, the Commission has prescribed the form and content of the\nfinancial statements to ensure that investors have access to information necessary for investment\nand voting decisions. The Commission adopted Regulation S-X in 1940, which governs the\nform and content of the financial statements, pursuant to its authority under, among other\nprovisions, Sections 7 and 19(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 12 and 23(a) of the Exchange\n210 15 U.S.C. 77s(a).\n211 15 U.S.C. 78m(b)(1); see 15 U.S.C. 78w(a)(1) (\u201cThe Commission . . . shall . . . have the power to make\nsuch rules and regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to implement the provisions of [the\nExchange Act] for which [it is] responsible or for the execution of the functions vested in [it] by [the\nExchange Act], and may for such purposes classify persons, securities, transactions, statements,\napplications, reports, and other matters within their respective jurisdictions, and prescribe greater, lesser, or\ndifferent requirements for different classes thereof.\u201d); see also 15 U.S.C. 7218(c) (\u201cNothing in the\n[Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002] . . . shall be construed to impair or limit the authority of the Commission to\nestablish accounting principles or standards for purposes of enforcement of the securities laws.\u201d); Policy\nStatement: Reaffirming the Status of the FASB as a Designated Private-Sector Standard Setter, Release No.\n33-8221 (Apr. 25, 2003) [68 FR 23333, 23334 (May 1, 2003)] (\u201cWhile the Commission consistently has\nlooked to the private sector in the past to set accounting standards, the securities laws, including the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act, clearly provide the Commission with authority to set accounting standards for public\ncompanies and other entities that file financial statements with the Commission.\u201d).\n69\n\nAct.212 Over time, the Commission has amended Regulation S-X to add, modify, and eliminate\nrequirements, as appropriate, with respect to the form and content of the financial statements,\ntaking into consideration the development of accounting practices in the marketplace, investors\u2019\nneed for information important to their decision-making, as well of the costs of such disclosures.\nFor example, the Commission has on numerous occasions amended Regulation S-X to\nrequire the disclosure of particular items of information in the balance sheet or in the income\nstatement.213 The Commission has similarly amended Regulation S-X to require additional\ninformation in the financial statements with respect to particular issuers or types of transactions,\nwhen it has determined that action in those specific areas was responsive to the information\nneeds of investors.214\nSimilarly, the Commission is adopting the final rules based on its determination that the\nrequired financial statement disclosures will provide investors with information that is important\nto their investment and voting decisions.

As explained in greater detail below, investors have expressed a need for\nthis information,215 and we believe the final rules will allow investors to make better informed\ninvestment or voting decisions by eliciting more complete disclosure of financial statement\neffects and by improving the consistency, comparability, and reliability of the disclosures.\nFor similar reasons, we disagree with objections by commenters based on the non-\ndelegation and major-questions doctrines.216 The non-delegation objection is misplaced because\nthe long-standing statutory authority that we rely on provides intelligible principles to which the\nCommission must conform in its rulemaking.217 Indeed, the Supreme Court early in the\nCommission\u2019s history rejected a non-delegation challenge to one of the securities laws that the\nCommission administered, and the well-tested delegation of rulemaking authority that we\nexercise here likewise falls comfortably within the Court\u2019s holding that a delegation poses no\nconstitutional difficulty when it provides standards that derive \u201cmeaningful content from the\npurpose of the Act, its factual background and the statutory context in which they appear.\u201d218\nAlso, the major-questions objection is misplaced because the Commission is not claiming to\n\u201cdiscover in a long-extant statute an unheralded power representing a transformative expansion\nin [its] regulatory authority.\u201d219 Nor is it seeking to determine national environmental policy or\n215 See infra notes 1741 and 2133.

Consistent with this\nauthority and its traditional role, the Commission is agnostic as to whether and how issuers\nmanage climate-related risks so long as they appropriately inform investors of material risks.\nFinally, we disagree with commenters who raised objections to the proposed rules on\nFirst Amendment grounds.221 The required disclosures are factual information about certain\nrisks companies face to their businesses, finances, and operations\u2013the type of information that\ncompanies routinely disclose when seeking investments from the public. And as discussed\nthroughout this release, these required disclosures also advance crucial interests: the final rules\nrespond to the growing investor need for more reliable information regarding climate-related\nrisks by providing investors with information that is important to their investment and voting\ndecisions. Further, the final rules have been appropriately tailored to serve those interests,\nincluding with a number of significant changes having been made from the proposal to take\naccount of the burdens imposed by requiring such disclosures.\n220 See, e.g., letters from Andrew N. Vollmer (May 9, 2022); Andrew N. Vollmer (Apr. 12, 2022); Morrisey et\nal. (June 15, 2022); Cunningham et al. (Apr. 25, 2022); Sharfman et al. For similar reasons, we disagree\nwith commenters who suggested the disclosures required by the final rules impermissibly interfere with\nstate corporate law. See, e.g., letters from Morrisey et al.

Proposed Rule\nThe Commission proposed to require a registrant to disclose any climate-related risks\nreasonably likely to have a material impact on the registrant\u2019s business or consolidated financial\nstatements.222 As proposed, a registrant could also optionally disclose the actual and potential\nimpacts of any climate-related opportunities it is pursuing.223 The Commission proposed\ndefinitions of \u201cclimate-related risks\u201d and \u201cclimate-related opportunities\u201d that were substantially\nsimilar to the TCFD\u2019s corresponding definitions of those terms224 to provide a common\nterminology that would allow registrants to disclose climate-related risks and opportunities in a\nconsistent and comparable way. In the Proposing Release, the Commission expressed its belief\nthat grounding the definitions in a framework that is already widely accepted could help limit the\nburden on registrants to identify and describe climate-related risks while improving the\ncomparability and usefulness of the disclosures for investors.225\nThe Commission proposed to define \u201cclimate-related risks\u201d to mean the actual or\npotential negative impacts of climate-related conditions and events on a registrant\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial statements, business operations, or value chains, as a whole.226 The Commission\nproposed to define \u201cvalue chain\u201d to mean the upstream and downstream activities related to a\n222 See Proposing Release, section II.B.1.\n223 See id.\n224 See TCFD, Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, Appendix 5\navailable at https://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/60/2020/10/FINAL-2017-TCFD-Report-11052018.pdf.\n225 See Proposing Release, section II.B.1.\n226 See id.\n73\n\nregistrant\u2019s operations.227 Under the proposed definition, upstream activities would include\nactivities by a party other than the registrant that relate to the initial stages of a registrant\u2019s\nproduction of a good or service (e.g., materials sourcing, materials processing, and supplier\nactivities). Downstream activities would include activities by a party other than the registrant\nthat relate to processing materials into a finished product and delivering it or providing a service\nto the end user (e.g., transportation and distribution, processing of sold products, use of sold\nproducts, end of life treatment of sold products, and investments).228 The Commission proposed\nincluding a registrant\u2019s value chain within the definition of climate-related risks to capture the\nfull extent of a registrant\u2019s potential exposure to climate-related risks.229\nClimate-related conditions and events can present risks related to the physical impacts of\nthe climate (\u201cphysical risks\u201d) and risks related to a potential transition to a lower carbon\neconomy (\u201ctransition risks\u201d). The Commission proposed to define \u201cphysical risks\u201d to include\nboth acute and chronic risks to a registrant\u2019s business operations or the operations of those with\nwhom it does business.230 The Commission proposed to define \u201cacute risks\u201d to mean event-\ndriven risks related to shorter-term extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, floods, and\ntornadoes.231 Under the proposed rule, \u201cchronic risks\u201d would be defined to mean those risks that\na business may face as a result of longer term weather patterns and related effects, such as\nsustained higher temperatures, sea level rise, drought, and increased wildfires, as well as related\neffects such as decreased arability of farmland, decreased habitability of land, and decreased\n227 See id.\n228 See id.\n229 See id.\n230 See id.\n231 See id.\n74\n\navailability of fresh water.232\nThe Commission proposed to define transition risks to mean the actual or potential\nnegative impacts on a registrant\u2019s consolidated financial statements, business operations, or\nvalue chains attributable to regulatory, technological, and market changes to address the\nmitigation of, or adaptation to, climate-related risks.233 Transition risks would include, but not\nbe limited to, increased costs attributable to climate-related changes in law or policy, reduced\nmarket demand for carbon-intensive products leading to decreased sales, prices, or profits for\nsuch products, the devaluation or abandonment of assets, risk of legal liability and litigation\ndefense costs, competitive pressures associated with the adoption of new technologies,\nreputational impacts (including those stemming from a registrant\u2019s customers or business\ncounterparties) that might trigger changes to market behavior, changes in consumer preferences\nor behavior, or changes in a registrant\u2019s behavior.234\nThe Commission proposed to require a registrant to specify whether an identified\nclimate-related risk is a physical or transition risk so that investors can better understand the\nnature of the risk.235 If a physical risk, the rule proposal would require a registrant to describe\nthe nature of the risk, including whether it may be categorized as an acute or chronic risk.236 A\nregistrant would also be required to describe the location and nature of the properties, processes,\nor operations subject to the physical risk.237 The rule proposal defined \u201clocation\u201d to mean a ZIP\n232 See id.\n233 See id.\n234 See id.\n235 See id.\n236 See id.\n237 See id.\n75\n\ncode or, in a jurisdiction that does not use ZIP codes, a similar subnational postal zone or\ngeographic location.\nThe Commission proposed to require additional disclosure from a registrant that has\nidentified a climate-related risk related to flooding or high water stress. As proposed, if a risk\nconcerns the flooding of buildings, plants, or properties located in flood hazard areas, the\nregistrant would be required to disclose the percentage of those assets that are located in flood\nhazard areas in addition to their location.238 If a risk concerns the location of assets in regions of\nhigh or extremely high water stress, as proposed, the registrant would be required to disclose the\namount of assets (e.g., book value and as a percentage of total assets) located in those regions in\naddition to their location. The registrant would also be required to disclose the percentage of the\nregistrant\u2019s total water usage from water withdrawn in those regions.239\nThe Commission proposed to require a registrant to describe the nature of an identified\ntransition risk, including whether it relates to regulatory, technological, market (including\nchanging consumer, business counterparty, and investor preferences), liability, reputational, or\nother transition-related factors, and how those factors impact the registrant.240 In this regard, the\nproposed rule stated that a registrant that has significant operations in a jurisdiction that has\nmade a GHG emissions reduction commitment may be exposed to transition risks related to the\nimplementation of the commitment.241\nAs the Commission noted in the Proposing Release, climate-related conditions and any\ntransition to a lower carbon economy may also present opportunities for registrants and\n238 See id.\n239 See id.\n240 See id.\n241 See id.\n76"

Comments\nMany commenters supported the proposal to require a registrant to disclose any climate-\nrelated risks that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on its business or consolidated\nfinancial statements.244 These commenters provided various reasons for supporting the proposal.\nFor example, one commenter noted that it views material climate-related risks and opportunities\nas fundamental financial factors that impact company cash flows and the valuation investors\nattribute to those cash flows and stated that the proposed rules will lead to \u201cmore consistent,\ncomparable, and reliable disclosures that will enable investors to make better decisions on how\nand where to allocate capital.\u201d245 Another commenter stated that the proposed requirements\nwould provide a thorough foundation for disclosure of climate risks, including future risks.246 A\ndifferent commenter stated that the proposed disclosure requirement would ensure that investors\nreceive specific, comparable details about registrants\u2019 climate-related risks, which are currently\nlacking from many registrants.247 One other commenter stated that, based on its own research,\n242 See id.\n243 See id.\n244 See, e.g., letters from Acadian Asset Management (June 14, 2022) (\u201cAcadian Asset Mgmt.\u201d); AGs of Cal.\net al.; AllianceBernstein; Amer. for Fin.

Mgmt.\u201d); TotalEnergies; and\nWellington Mgmt.\n81\n\nwhich a registrant is exposed.270 Some commenters generally stressed the importance to\ninvestors of obtaining quantitative data from registrants about the physical risks to which they\nare subject and recommended that the Commission require registrants to similarly provide the\npercentage of assets or other quantitative data relevant to assessing a registrant\u2019s exposure to\nother material physical risks, such as heatwaves, droughts, and wildfires.271\nWith regard to flooding risk disclosure, some commenters recommended that the\nCommission require the use of Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s (\u201cFEMA\u2019s\u201d) flood\nhazard terminology and maps to help further the comparability of the disclosure.272 One\ncommenter recommended the use of a different flood model that it believed was more up-to-date\nand more comprehensive than FEMA\u2019s flood mapping.273 Another commenter supported an\napproach that would allow for different definitions of \u201cflood hazard area\u201d or \u201cwater-stressed\narea\u201d to be used as long as the registrant disclosed the source of the definitions together with the\nmethodologies and assumptions used in disclosing the water-based physical risk.274\nSeveral commenters supported the proposed provision requiring a registrant to describe\nthe nature of an identified transition risk, including whether it relates to regulatory,\ntechnological, market (including changing consumer, business counterparty, and investor\npreferences), liability, reputational, or other transition-related factors, and how those factors\nimpact the registrant.275 Some commenters also supported the proposed definition of transition\n270 See, e.g., letters from ERM CVS; IAA; Moody\u2019s; and Morningstar.\n271 See, e.g., letters from Anthesis; CalPERS; IAA; and Morningstar.\n272 See, e.g., letters from Anthesis; NRDC; and PRI.\n273 See letter from CalPERS (recommending use of the First Street Foundation Flood Model).\n274 See letter from Moody\u2019s; see also letter from Wellington Mgmt.

This commenter provided the following examples of when climate-related risks\ninvolving a registrant\u2019s value chain may be more important to investors than such risks involving the\nregistrant\u2019s own operations: the manufacturer of \u201ca product reliant on a rare mineral for which mining may\nbe limited due to emissions created in extraction, precursor manufacturing, and transport, or, alternatively,\na lender whose primary business is financing emissions-intensive operations.\u201d\n280 See letter from Eni SpA.\n83\n\nactivities related to a registrant\u2019s operations.281 One commenter stated that the definition of\nvalue chain should be consistent with the definition provided by the GHG Protocol.282\nMany other commenters opposed the proposed climate-related risk disclosure\nrequirement.283 Some of these commenters contended that the Commission\u2019s rules already\nrequire a registrant to disclose material climate risks, and that therefore there is no need for the\nproposed climate-related risk disclosure requirement.284 Several other commenters stated that\nthe proposed climate-related risk disclosure requirement would inundate investors with an\nextensive amount of granular information that is largely immaterial.285 Commenters provided as\nan example of such immaterial disclosure the proposed requirement to disclose the ZIP codes of\nassets located in flood hazard areas or other regions in which a registrant\u2019s assets are subject to a\nmaterial climate-related risk.286 Some commenters stated that the highly detailed disclosure\nrequired by the proposed climate risk disclosure rule would confuse investors by causing them to\nbelieve that a climate-related risk is more important than other disclosed risks that are presented\n281 See, e.g., letters from Amer. for Fin. Reform, Sunrise Project et al.; Anthesis; and Morningstar.\n282 See letter from Morningstar; see also letter from D.

    "text": "risks and would provide investors with a more balanced perspective of the overall impacts of\nclimate on a company\u2019s business and operating performance.312\nc. Final Rules\nWe are adopting final rules (Item 1502(a)) to require the disclosure of any climate-related\nrisks that have materially impacted or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the\nregistrant, including on its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, with\nseveral modifications in response to commenter concerns.313 We disagree with those\ncommenters who stated that a climate-related risk disclosure provision was not necessary\nbecause the Commission\u2019s general risk factors disclosure rule already requires such\ndisclosure.314 In our view, a separate disclosure provision specifically focused on climate-related\nrisks will help investors better understand a registrant\u2019s assessment of whether its business is, or\nis reasonably likely to be, exposed to a material climate-related risk, and thereby enhance\ninvestor protection. Many commenters indicated that the Commission\u2019s current disclosure rules,\nincluding the general risk factor provision, has not provided investors with disclosure of climate-\nrelated risks and their financial impacts at the level of detail sought by investors that would make\nthe disclosure useful for their investment or voting decisions.315 The final rules, by contrast, are\nresponsive to investors\u2019 need for decision-useful information regarding registrants\u2019 material\nclimate-related risks and will help ensure investors receive more consistent, comparable, and\nreliable disclosures about such risks.316\n312 See, e.g., letters from Morningstar; PwC; and World Business Council for Sustainable Development (Jun.\n16, 2022) (\u201cWBCSD\u201d).\n313 See 17 CFR 229.1502(a).\n314 See supra note 284 and accompanying text.\n315 See, e.g., supra note 102 and accompanying text; infra notes 395-397 and accompanying text.\n316 See supra notes 244-249 and accompanying text.\n89\n\nFurthermore, adopting a climate-related risk disclosure rule that uses similar definitions\n(set forth in Item 1500) and is based on the climate-related disclosure framework of the TCFD,\nwith which many registrants and investors are already familiar, will assist in standardizing\nclimate-related risk disclosure and help elicit more consistent, comparable, and useful\ninformation for investors and limit the reporting burden for those registrants that are already\nproviding some climate-related disclosure based on the TCFD framework.\nAt the same time, we recognize that many commenters expressed significant concerns\nabout the scope of the proposed rules, indicating that they may elicit too much detail, may be\ncostly or burdensome, could result in competitive harm, or may obscure other material\ninformation.317 We have sought to address these concerns by modifying the definition of\nclimate-related risks, by making the climate-related risk disclosure requirements less\nprescriptive, and by specifying the time frames during which a registrant should describe\nwhether any such material risks are reasonably likely to manifest, as discussed below.318\nThe proposed rule would have required a registrant to describe any climate-related risks\nreasonably likely to have a material impact on the registrant, including on its business or\nconsolidated financial statements. We have substituted \u201cresults of operations\u201d and \u201cfinancial\ncondition\u201d for \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d here and in several of the final rule provisions\nto be more consistent with other Commission rules relevant to risk assessment, such as Item 303\nof Regulation S-K regarding MD&A. We have used the term \u201cbusiness strategy\u201d in the final\nrules to more closely align the final rules with the TCFD recommendation regarding the\ndisclosure of the impacts of climate-related risks on strategy. These revisions do not create any\n317 See supra notes 283 and 285.\n318 See infra section II.C.2.\n90\n\nsubstantive differences compared to the proposed rules but should facilitate compliance because\nmany registrants should be familiar with the terminology used.\nSimilar to the rule proposal, the final rules define climate-related risks to mean the actual\nor potential negative impacts of climate-related conditions and events on a registrant\u2019s business,\nresults of operations, or financial condition.319 To make a registrant\u2019s determination of whether\nit is exposed to a material climate-related risk less burdensome, in response to commenters\u2019\nconcerns,320 we have eliminated the reference to negative climate-related impacts on a\nregistrant\u2019s value chain from the definition of climate-related risks. This change means that a\nclimate-related risk involving a registrant\u2019s value chain would generally not need to be disclosed\nexcept where such risk has materially impacted or is reasonably likely to materially impact the\nregistrant\u2019s business, results of operations, or financial condition. In addition, because a\nregistrant may be able to assess the material risks posed by its value chain without having to\nrequest input from third parties in its value chain, this change will also limit the burdens of\nclimate risk assessment on parties in a registrant\u2019s value chain that might have occurred under\nthe rule proposal.321\nSimilar to the rule proposal, the definition of climate-related risks includes both physical\nrisks and transition risks. Also similar to the proposed definition, the final rules define \u201cphysical\nrisks\u201d to include both acute and chronic risks to a registrant\u2019s business operations.322 However,\nwe are not including in the definition acute or chronic risks to the operations of those with whom\na registrant does business, as proposed. This change addresses the concerns of commenters\n319 See 17 CFR 229.1500.\n320 See supra notes 303 and 304 and accompanying text.\n321 See supra notes 303 and 304 and accompanying text.\n322 See 17 CFR 229.1500\n91\n\nregarding burdens associated with obtaining climate risk information about their counterparties\nover which they lack control.323\nSimilar to the rule proposal, \u201cacute risks\u201d is defined as event-driven risks and may relate\nto shorter-term severe weather events, such as hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, and wildfires.324\n\u201cChronic risks\u201d is defined as those risks that the business may face as a result of longer term\nweather patterns, such as sustained higher temperatures, sea level rise, and drought, as well as\nrelated effects such as decreased arability of farmland, decreased habitability of land, and\ndecreased availability of fresh water.325 These enumerated risks are provided as examples of the\ntypes of physical risks to be disclosed and many represent physical risks that have already\nimpacted and may continue to impact registrants across a wide range of economic sectors.326\nThe final rules define \u201ctransition risks\u201d largely as proposed to mean the actual or\npotential negative impacts on a registrant\u2019s business, results of operations, or financial condition\nattributable to regulatory, technological, and market changes to address the mitigation of, or\nadaptation to, climate-related risks.327 For reasons discussed above in relation to the definition\nof \u201cclimate-related risks,\u201d we are no longer including value chain impacts in the definition of\n\u201ctransition risks.\u201d328 The final rules\u2019 definition of \u201ctransition risks\u201d includes the same non-\n323 See, e.g., letter from Chamber.\n324 See 17 CFR 229.1500. See infra section II.K.3.c.v for a discussion of the phrase \u201csevere weather events\u201d\nas used in subpart 1500 of Regulation S-K and Article 14 of Regulation S-X.\n325 See id.\n326 As discussed in more detail in section II.K.3.c.v, although Article 14 of Regulation S-X requires a\nregistrant to disclose certain financial effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions, which\nmay include weather events that are not climate-related, subpart 1500 of Regulation S-K does not require\nthe disclosure of material impacts from non-climate-related weather events.\n327 See 17 CFR 229.1500.\n328 As noted above, a registrant would only need to disclose the transition risk of a party in its value chain\nwhen such transition risk has materially impacted or is reasonably likely to materially impact the registrant\nitself.\n92\n\nexclusive list of examples of transition risks as the rule proposal. Transition risks include, but\nare not limited to, increased costs attributable to climate-related changes in law or policy,\nreduced market demand for carbon-intensive products leading to decreased sales, prices, or\nprofits for such products, the devaluation or abandonment of assets, risk of legal liability and\nlitigation defense costs, competitive pressures associated with the adoption of new technologies,\nreputational impacts (including those stemming from a registrant\u2019s customers or business\ncounterparties) that might trigger changes to market behavior, changes in consumer preferences\nor behavior, or changes in a registrant\u2019s behavior.329\nAlthough some commenters asked the Commission to provide additional examples of\ntransition risks in the definition,330 we decline to do so. The final rules\u2019 examples are non-\nexclusive331 and, consistent with the TCFD framework, a registrant\u2019s description of its material\ntransition risks should include any type of transition risk that is applicable based on its particular\nfacts and circumstances.332 The particular type of material transition risk disclosed may be one\nthat is not included or only partially included in the definition. Not every manifestation of\ntransition risk, however, may apply or be material to every registrant and transition risks are\ndynamic and may change over time.\n329 See 17 CFR 229.1500. For example, one source of transition risk may be the IRA, Pub. Law 117\u2013169,\nwhich was signed into Federal law on Aug. 16, 2022, and includes various initiatives meant to encourage\ncompanies, states, and consumers to invest in and adopt renewable energy and other \u201cclean energy\u201d\ntechnologies. See The White House, Building A Clean Energy Economy: A Guidebook To The Inflation\nReduction Act\u2019s Investments In Clean Energy And Climate Action (Dec. 2022) (\u201cInflation Reduction Act\nGuidebook\u201d). If, as a result of the IRA, consumers, small businesses, and other entities switch to more\nenergy efficient products and services, a registrant that produces or uses less energy efficient products\ncould face material impacts to its business, results of operations, or financial condition.\n330 See supra note 277 and accompanying text.\n331 See 17 CFR 229.1500 (definition of transition risk).\n332 See, e.g., TCFD, Guidance on Metrics, Targets, and Transition Plans section E (Oct. 2021), available at\nhttps://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/60/2021/07/2021-Metrics_Targets_Guidance-1.pdf.\n93\n\nThe proposed rules would have required a registrant to disclose certain items of\ninformation about any material climate-related risk that a registrant has identified.333 In order to\nhelp address commenters\u2019 concerns that the rule proposal was too burdensome and could result\nin the disclosure of immaterial information, we have revised Item 1502, as adopted, to be less\nprescriptive. In doing so, we have sought to strike an appropriate balance between providing\ninvestors with more consistent and decision-useful information about material climate-related\nrisks while being conscious of the costs to registrants and investors of requiring specified\ndisclosures that may not be relevant in every circumstance. The final rules provide that a\nregistrant that has identified a climate-related risk pursuant to Item 1502 must disclose whether\nthe risk is a physical or transition risk, providing information necessary to an understanding of\nthe nature of the risk presented and the extent of the registrant\u2019s exposure to the risk.334 The\nfinal rules then provide a non-exclusive list of disclosures that a registrant must disclose as\napplicable:\n\u2022 If a physical risk, whether it may be categorized as an acute or chronic risk, and the\ngeographic location and nature of the properties, processes, or operations subject to the\nphysical risk;335 and\n\u2022 If a transition risk, whether it relates to regulatory, technological, market (including\nchanging consumer, business counterparty, and investor preferences), or other transition-\nrelated factors, and how those factors impact the registrant.336\n333 See Proposing Release, section II.B.1.\n334 See 17 CFR 229.1502(a).\n335 See 17 CFR 229.1502(a)(1)(i).\n336 See 17 CFR 229.1502(a)(1)(ii).\n94\n\nWhen proposing the climate-related disclosure rules, the Commission stated that in some\ninstances, chronic risks might give rise to acute risks. For example, a drought (a chronic risk)\nmight contribute to wildfires (an acute risk), or increased temperatures (a chronic risk) might\ncontribute to severe storms (an acute risk). In such instances, the Commission indicated that a\nregistrant should provide a clear and consistent description of the nature of the risk and how it\nmay affect a related risk, as well as how those risks have evolved or are expected to evolve over\ntime.337\nThe final rules require a registrant to provide information necessary to an understanding\nof the nature of the risk presented and the extent of the registrant\u2019s exposure to the risk. We\nagree, however, with commenters that indicated that requiring a discussion about the interaction\nof two related physical risks may, due to its complexity, increase the burden on the registrant\nwithout yielding a corresponding benefit for investors.338 While a registrant may opt to provide\nsuch discussion, it is not a mandatory disclosure item under the final rules. We also agree with\ncommenters that stated that, for complex and overlapping physical risks, registrants can\ndetermine how best to categorize the physical risk as either acute or chronic.339 What is\nimportant is that a registrant describe the climate-related physical risks it faces clearly and\nconsistently, including regarding the particular categories of physical risk. As a disclosed risk\ndevelops over time, for example where the category of physical risk has changed and/or the\nnature of the impact to the registrant has evolved, depending on the facts and circumstances, the\nregistrant may need to describe the changed risk in order for an investor to understand the impact\n337 See Proposing Release, section II.B.1.\n338 See, e.g., letters from CEMEX; Eni SpA; and ERM CVS.\n339 See letter from IAA.\n95\n\nor reasonably likely impact of the risk on the registrant, including on its business strategy, results\nof operations, or financial condition.\nSome commenters opposed proposed Item 1502 because in their view it would be\ndifficult for a registrant to distinguish between a climate-related physical risk and an ordinary\nweather risk,340 or between a business activity in response to a transition risk and one that is part\nof a routine business strategy.341 While we recognize that application of some of the\nCommission\u2019s climate disclosure rules may initially be difficult for certain registrants, we expect\nthat compliance will become easier as registrants grow more familiar with disclosing how\nclimate-related factors may impact their business strategies.342 In this regard, we note that many\nregistrants are already providing some of the TCFD-recommended disclosures, although in a\npiecemeal fashion and largely outside of the registrant\u2019s Commission filings. In addition, we\nhave modified the proposed rules in several places to require disclosure only if a registrant is\nalready undertaking a particular analysis or practice or has already made a judgment that a\nparticular risk is climate-related.343 Further, the lengthy phase in periods for the final rules will\nprovide registrants additional time to develop, modify, and implement any processes and controls\nnecessary to the assessment and reporting of any material climate-related risk.344\n340 In this regard, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (\u201cNOAA\u201d), weather\nrefers to short-term changes in the atmosphere whereas climate describes what the weather is like over a\nlong period of time in a specific area. See NOAA, What\u2019s the Difference Between Weather and Climate?,\navailable at https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/weather-vs-climate.\n341 See supra notes 289 and 298.\n342 We also expect that compliance with the final rules will become easier as registrants commence disclosing\nclimate-related information pursuant to other jurisdictions\u2019 climate disclosure requirements, to the extent\nthose requirements are similar to the final rules.\n343 See, e.g., infra section II.D.\n344 See infra section II.O.\n96\n\nThe final rules include several changes from the proposal that mitigate some of the\nburdens of Item 1502(a), as it was proposed. For example, the rule proposal would have\nrequired a registrant to disclose the location and nature of the properties, processes, or operations\nsubject to the physical risk, and to provide the ZIP code or other subnational postal zone.345 The\nfinal rules we are adopting no longer require such disclosure and instead include, as one of the\nphysical risk items that a registrant must disclose, as applicable, the geographic location and\nnature of the properties, processes, or operations subject to the identified physical risk.346 This\nrevision is intended to address the concern of many commenters that the proposed ZIP code\ndisclosure requirement would be burdensome to produce and would likely not provide useful\ninformation for many investors.347 This revision will give registrants the flexibility to determine\nthe granularity of any location disclosures based on their particular facts and circumstances as\nlong as they provide information necessary to understand the extent of the registrant\u2019s exposure\nto the material risk.\nThe proposal would have called for specific information about physical risks, such as\ndisclosures relating to flooding and the location of assets in regions of high or extremely high\nwater stress. In particular, the rule proposal would have required a registrant that faces a\nmaterial physical risk due to flooding or water stress to disclose the percentage of buildings,\nplants, or properties that are located in flood hazard areas or the amount and percentage of assets\nlocated in water-stressed areas. In a change from the rule proposal, we have eliminated this\nproposed requirement in order to make the final rules less burdensome and permit the registrant\n345 See Proposing Release, section II.B.1.\n346 See 17 CFR 229.1502(a)(1).\n347 See supra note 286 and accompanying text.\n97\n\nto determine the particular metrics that it should disclose, if any, based on its particular facts and\ncircumstances. Instead, the physical risk disclosure provision we are adopting is less prescriptive\nand subject to the general condition applicable to both physical and transition risk disclosure\nthat, when describing a material climate-related risk, a registrant must provide information\nnecessary to an understanding of the nature of the risk presented and the extent of the registrant\u2019s\nexposure to the risk.348\nThese revisions help address the concern of some commenters that the proposed\ndisclosure requirements were too prescriptive and could result in overly granular and immaterial\ndisclosure.349 The less prescriptive approach of the final rules also addresses the concern of\nsome commenters that the resulting disclosure could cause investor confusion by obscuring other\ndisclosed risks that are presented in less detail.350 We expect that the final rules will elicit\ndisclosures more reflective of a registrant\u2019s particular business practices.\nWith respect to those commenters who stated that the required metrics disclosure should\ncover more than just water-related physical risks, the less prescriptive approach in the final rules\neliminates any potential overemphasis on water-related physical risks and gives registrants\nflexibility to describe any physical risks they may be facing.351 Finally, the revised approach in\n348 See 17 CFR 229.1502(a).\n349 See, e.g., letters from ABA; CEMEX; NAM; and SIFMA.\n350 See supra note 287 and accompanying text. As described below, the addition of materiality qualifiers to\ncertain of the final rule\u2019s climate risk disclosure requirements will also help address this concern by\neliciting detailed disclosure only when it is material. See infra section II.D.\n351 See, e.g., letters from CalPERS (recommending that the Commission should also require information on\nareas subject to droughts, heatwaves, and wildfires); IAA (recommending that the Commission require\nregistrants to provide quantitative details of the volume or revenue (percentage) contribution for facilities\nlocated in areas subject to water scarcity, flood risk, wildfires, and other climate-related natural disasters);\nand Morningstar (recommending that the Commission go further in mandating quantitative disclosures\nrelated to a registrant\u2019s assets exposed to physical climate risk, as such data is important across economic\nsectors).\n98\n\nthe final rules will allow a registrant\u2019s disclosures to adapt to changing circumstances over time,\nwhile still providing sufficient information for investors to understand and assess any such\nchanges.\nSimilar to the physical risk rule provision, the final rule requires registrants to disclose\nthe nature of any transition risk presented and the extent of the registrant\u2019s exposure to the risk.\nIt also includes a non-exclusive list of disclosures the registrant must provide, as applicable,\nincluding whether the transition risk relates to regulatory, technological, market, or other\ntransition-related factors, and how those factors impact the registrant.352 Describing the nature\nof an identified transition risk in this manner will help investors understand the realized or\npotential material impacts of the identified transition risk and whether and how a registrant\nintends to mitigate or adapt to such risk.\nConsistent with the rule proposal, the final rule provision states that a registrant that has\nsignificant operations in a jurisdiction that has made a GHG emissions reduction commitment\nshould consider whether it may be exposed to a material transition risk related to the\nimplementation of the commitment.353 Including this guidance within the rule text will serve to\n352 See 17 CFR 229.1502(a) and 1502(a)(2). In a change from the proposal, the final rules omit a specific\nreference to liability and reputational factors from the transition risk disclosure required pursuant to Item\n1502(a)(2). This change was made in order to conform more closely to the definition of \u201ctransition risks\u201d\nin Item 1500, which refers to \u201cregulatory, technological, and market changes.\u201d Although this definition\nrefers to impacts to a registrant\u2019s liability or reputation as non-exclusive examples of negative impacts\nresulting from such changes, the definition of transition risks also refers to other examples of negative\nimpacts that are not specifically mentioned in Item 1502(a)(2). To streamline the Item 1502(a)(2)\ndisclosure requirement, and to avoid giving undue emphasis to impacts to a registrant\u2019s liability or\nreputation over other transition risk-related impacts, we have removed the specific reference to liability and\nreputational factors and have retained the more general reference to \u201cother transition-related factors.\u201d A\nregistrant that, due to regulatory, technological, or market changes, has incurred or is reasonably likely to\nincur a material negative impact to its reputation or liability will be required to include a description of\nsuch impact, together with any other material transition-related impact, in its disclosure pursuant to Item\n1502(a)(2).\n353 See 17 CFR 229.1502(a)(2).\n99"

We are treating the\ndisclosure of climate-related opportunities the same as other voluntary disclosure.

Final Rule\nIn a change from the rule proposal, the final rule (Item 1502(a)) provides that in\ndescribing any climate-related risks that have materially impacted or are reasonably likely to\nhave a material impact, a registrant should describe whether such risks are reasonably likely to\nmanifest in the short-term (i.e., the next 12 months) and separately in the long-term (i.e., beyond\nthe next 12 months).374 This temporal standard is generally consistent with an existing standard\nin MD&A, which was recommended by some commenters.375 That MD&A standard\nspecifically requires a registrant to analyze its ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of\ncash to meet its requirements and plans for cash in the short-term (i.e., the next 12 months from\nthe most recent fiscal period end required to be presented) and separately in the long-term (i.e.,\n371 See, e.g., letters from ABA; and SIFMA; see also letter from NAM (stating that the relevant time periods\nshould be short-term (18 to 24 months) and long-term (anything over 24 months), according to the\nregistrant\u2019s particular facts and circumstances).\n372 See letter from ABA.\n373 See id.\n374 See 17 CFR 229.1502(a).\n375 See, e.g., letter from ABA.\n103\n\nbeyond the next 12 months).376 The existing MD&A standard also generally requires that a\nregistrant \u201cprovide insight into material opportunities, challenges and risks, such as those\npresented by known material trends and uncertainties, on which the company\u2019s executives are\nmost focused for both the short and long term, as well as the actions they are taking to address\nthese opportunities, challenges and risks.\u201d377 We are adopting this temporal standard to address\nthe concern of commenters that imposition of a different temporal standard (and, in particular,\none that includes a \u201cmedium term\u201d period) for climate risk disclosure would pose challenges and\npotentially conflict with a registrant\u2019s assessment of other risks and events that are reasonably\nlikely to have a material impact on its future operations.378 We note, however, that a registrant is\nnot precluded from breaking down its description of risks reasonably likely to manifest beyond\nthe next 12 months into components that may include more medium- and longer-term risks, if\nthat is consistent with the registrant\u2019s assessment and management of the climate-related risk.\nWe are modeling the temporal standard in Item 1502(a) on this MD&A standard as\nrecommended by commenters because the materiality determination that a registrant will be\nrequired to make regarding climate-related risks under the final rules is the same as what is\ngenerally required when preparing the MD&A section in a registration statement or annual\nreport.

Accordingly, management should make an objective\nevaluation, based on materiality, including where the fruition of future events is unknown.383\nD. Disclosure Regarding Impacts of Climate-Related Risks on Strategy, Business\nModel, and Outlook\n1. Disclosure of Material Impacts (Item 1502(b), (c), and (d))\na. Proposed Rules\nThe Commission proposed to require a registrant to describe the actual and potential\nimpacts on its strategy, business model, and outlook of those climate-related risks that it must\ndisclose pursuant to proposed Item 1502(a).384 The Commission further proposed to require a\nregistrant to include in such description any impacts on its:\nprinciples). Staff accounting bulletins are not rules or interpretations of the Commission, nor are they\npublished as bearing the Commission's official approval. They represent interpretations and practices\nfollowed by the Division of Corporation Finance and the Office of the Chief Accountant in administering\nthe disclosure requirements of the Federal securities laws. Staff accounting bulletins and any other staff\nstatements discussed in this release have no legal force or effect: they do not alter or amend applicable law,\nand they create no new or additional obligations for any person.\n383 See, e.g., 2020 MD&A Adopting Release. As noted above, the materiality determination that a registrant\nwill be required to make regarding climate-related risks under the final rules is the same as what is\ngenerally required when preparing the MD&A section of a registration statement or annual report.\nAccordingly, registrants can look to the guidance in the 2020 MD&A Adopting Release regarding\napplication of the \u201creasonably likely\u201d standard when considering their disclosure obligations under the\nvarious components of Item 1502. According to this guidance, the reasonably likely standard \u201cis not\nintended to, nor does it require, registrants to affirm the non-existence or non-occurrence of a material\nfuture event.\u201d Rather, \u201cit requires management to make a thoughtful and objective evaluation, based on\nmateriality, including where the fruition of future events is unknown.\u201d 2020 MD&A Adopting Release, 86\nFR at 2093.\n384 See Proposing Release, section II.C.1.\n106\n\n\u2022 Business operations, including the types and locations of its operations;\n\u2022 Products or services;\n\u2022 Suppliers and other parties in its value chain;\n\u2022 Activities to mitigate or adapt to climate-related risks, including adoption of new\ntechnologies or processes;\n\u2022 Expenditure for research and development; and\n\u2022 Any other significant changes or impacts.\nThe proposed rules would have required a registrant to disclose the time horizon for each\ndescribed impact (i.e., as manifested in the short, medium, or long term, as defined by the\nregistrant when determining its material climate-related risks).385\nWhen proposing these disclosure requirements, the Commission stated that information\nabout how climate-related risks have impacted or are likely to impact a registrant\u2019s strategy,\nbusiness model, and outlook can be important for purposes of making an investment or voting\ndecision about the registrant.386 The Commission further noted that, in response to a request for\npublic input,387 several commenters had stated that many registrants included largely boilerplate\ndiscussions about climate-related risks and failed to provide a meaningful analysis of the impacts\nof those risks on their businesses.388 The Commission proposed the disclosure requirements\nabout climate-related impacts to elicit more robust and company-specific disclosure on this\ntopic.389\n385 See id.\n386 See id.\n387 See Proposing Release, section I.B.\n388 See Proposing Release, section II.C.1.\n389 See id.\n107\n\nThe proposed rules also would have required a registrant to discuss whether and how it\nhas considered the identified impacts as part of its business strategy, financial planning, and\ncapital allocation.390 In this regard, the proposed rules would have required a registrant to\nprovide both current and forward-looking disclosures that facilitate an understanding of whether\nthe implications of the identified climate-related risks have been integrated into the registrant\u2019s\nbusiness model or strategy, including how resources are being used to mitigate climate-related\nrisks. The proposed rules would have required the discussion to include how any of the climate-\nrelated financial metrics referenced in proposed Article 14 of Regulation S-X, the metrics\nreferenced in the GHG emissions section of proposed subpart 1500 of Regulation S-K, or any of\nthe targets referenced in the targets and goals section of proposed subpart 1500, relate to the\nregistrant\u2019s business model or business strategy.391\nIn addition, the proposed rules would have required a registrant to provide a narrative\ndiscussion of whether and how any of its identified climate-related risks have affected or are\nreasonably likely to affect the registrant\u2019s consolidated financial statements.392 The proposed\nrules would have required this discussion to include any of the climate-related financial metrics\nreferenced in proposed Article 14 of Regulation S-X that demonstrate that the identified climate-\nrelated risks have had a material impact on the registrant\u2019s reported financial condition or\noperations.393 This proposed provision was intended to provide climate-related disclosure that is\nsimilar to MD&A, and, as noted in the discussion above, the proposed rules would allow a\nregistrant to provide such disclosure as part of its MD&A.\n390 See id.\n391 See id.\n392 See id.\n393 See id.\n108"

    "text": "used in Regulation S-K and might be interpreted by some registrants that do not have a business\nmodel as implying that they must adopt one.419\nSome commenters generally supported the proposed impact disclosure provision but\nrecommended that the Commission add a materiality qualifier to elicit disclosure of only the\nmost likely and significant impacts, which they asserted would provide more useful information\nfor investors and reduce a registrant\u2019s compliance burden.420 Similarly, some commenters\ngenerally supported some form of climate disclosure while recommending that the Commission\nmake the final rules more principles-based so that registrants could better tailor their disclosures\nto reflect their own particular facts and circumstances.421\nc. Final Rules\nThe final rule provision (Item 1502(b)) will require a registrant to describe the actual and\npotential material impacts of any climate-related risk identified in response to Item 1502(a) on\nthe registrant\u2019s strategy, business model, and outlook.422 Information about the actual and\npotential material impacts of climate-related risks on a registrant\u2019s strategy, business model, and\noutlook is central to understanding the extent to which a registrant\u2019s business strategy or business\nmodel has changed, is changing, or is expected to change to address those impacts. This\ninformation is also central to evaluating management\u2019s response to the impacts and the resiliency\nof the registrant\u2019s strategy to climate-related factors as it pertains to the registrant\u2019s results of\n419 See letter from ABA.\n420 See, e.g., letters from Amazon; Beller et al.; and ICI.\n421 See, e.g., letters from ABA; Beller et al.; and Walmart.\n422 See 17 CFR 229.1502(b). As used in the final rules, the term \u201coutlook\u201d means \u201cthe prospect for the\nfuture,\u201d consistent with its general definition. See Merriam-Webster Dictionary, available at\nhttps://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/outlook. For the avoidance of doubt, use of the term\n\u201coutlook\u201d is not intended to suggest that a registrant must disclose its earnings guidance or forecasts in\nresponse to Item 1502(b).\n114\n\noperations and financial condition. Numerous commenters on the proposal shared some or all of\nthese views.423\nThe proposed rule did not specifically include a materiality qualifier when requiring a\nregistrant to describe the actual and potential impacts of any identified climate-related risk in\nresponse to proposed Item 1502(a). In practice, however, proposed Item 1502(b) would have\nelicited disclosure focused on material impacts because proposed Item 1502(a) would have\nrequired a registrant to describe only those climate-related risks that the registrant had identified\nas having materially impacted or being reasonably likely to have a material impact on the\nregistrant.424 Nevertheless, we recognize that, as proposed, Item 1502(b) may have caused some\nconfusion regarding the scope of the proposed disclosure requirement.425 Some commenters\nmisinterpreted the rule proposal as requiring the disclosure of actual or potential impacts of\nclimate-related risks, regardless of their materiality.426 We have, therefore, added an explicit\nmateriality qualifier to Item 1502(b) to clarify that a registrant is only required to disclose\nmaterial impacts of climate-related risks that it has identified in response to Item 1502(a). This\nclarifying amendment will help address commenters\u2019 concerns that the proposed rule could result\nin the disclosure of large amounts of immaterial information and thus be unduly burdensome for\nregistrants.\nSome commenters asserted that the proposed rule provision was not necessary because\nthe Commission\u2019s existing rules generally require a registrant to disclose the effects of material\n423 See supra note 395 and accompanying text.\n424 See supra section II.C.1.a.\n425 See, e.g., letter from Fenwick West.\n426 See, e.g., letters from Fenwick West; and RILA.\n115\n\nrisks, including climate-related risks.427 However, as other commenters have stated, many\ncompanies do not discuss any climate-related risks in response to existing disclosure\nrequirements.428 Accordingly, a rule provision that specifically requires the disclosure of\nmaterial impacts of climate-related risks, and lists the types of potential material impacts that\nmust be described, if applicable, will provide investors access to this information on a more\nconsistent and comparable basis.429\nThe final rule provision largely lists the same types of potential material impacts of\nclimate-related risks as under the rule proposal. The list, which is intended to be non-exclusive,\nincludes, as applicable, material impacts on the registrant\u2019s:\n\u2022 Business operations, including the types and locations of its operations;\n\u2022 Products or services;\n\u2022 Suppliers, purchasers, or counterparties to material contracts, to the extent known or\nreasonably available;\n\u2022 Activities to mitigate or adapt to climate-related risks, including adoption of new\ntechnologies or processes; and\n\u2022 Expenditure for research and development.\nIf none of the listed types of impacts or any other impacts are material, a registrant need\nnot disclose them. Similarly, if a registrant has identified a climate-related risk that has\nmaterially impacted or is reasonably likely to impact its business strategy, results of operations,\nor financial condition, but the actual and potential material impact on its strategy, business\n427 See supra note 414 and accompanying text.\n428 See supra note 397 and accompanying text.\n429 See, e.g., letters from Amer. for Fin. Reform, Sunrise Project et al.; Eni SpA; and PRI.\n116\n\nmodel, and outlook is not specifically listed in the final rule, the impact will need to be disclosed.\nBy providing a non-exclusive list of material impacts of climate risks in the rule text, but not\nmandating that all or only these impacts be disclosed, the final rule will help elicit more\nmeaningful and relevant disclosure without overburdening registrants or investors with the\npresentation of irrelevant information.\nWe have revised one of the types of potential material impacts listed in the proposal that\nreferenced \u201csuppliers and other parties in [a registrant\u2019s] value chain,\u201d by replacing this phrase\nwith \u201c[s]uppliers, purchasers, or counterparties to material contracts, to the extent known or\nreasonably available.\u201d This revision is intended to address the concern of some commenters that\nrequiring a registrant to include material impacts to a registrant\u2019s value chain would be overly\nburdensome to both the registrant and to entities in the registrant\u2019s value chain.430 Thus the final\nrule limits the scope of this specific topic to include only material impacts to the registrant\u2019s\nsuppliers, purchasers, or counterparties to material contracts and further limits the information\nthat should be disclosed about those impacts to information that is known or is reasonably\navailable.431 The adopted provision is consistent with the Commission\u2019s general rules regarding\nthe disclosure of information that is difficult to obtain, which will apply to the final rules if their\nconditions are met.432 Accordingly, as modified, this provision will help limit the compliance\nburden of the final rules by eliminating any potential need for registrants to undertake\nunreasonable searches or requests for information from their value chains.\n430 See supra note 416 and accompanying text.\n431 See 17 CFR 229.1502(b)(3). Registrants are required to include material contracts in Commission filings\nunder existing rules. See, e.g., 17 CFR 229.601(b)(10).\n432 See 17 CFR 230.409 and 17 CFR 240.12b-21.\n117\n\nFinal Item 1502(c) will require a registrant to discuss whether and how the registrant\nconsiders any material impacts described in response to Item 1502(b) as part of its strategy,\nfinancial planning, and capital allocation.433 Similar to the rule proposal, but modified to make\nItem 1502(c) less prescriptive, the final rule provision will require a registrant to include in its\ndisclosure responsive to this provision, as applicable:\n\u2022 Whether the impacts of the climate-related risks described in response to Item 1502(b)\nhave been integrated into the registrant\u2019s business model or strategy, including whether\nand how resources are being used to mitigate climate-related risks; and\n\u2022 How any of the targets referenced in Item 1504434 or in a described transition plan435\nrelate to the registrant\u2019s business model or strategy.\nAs noted by several commenters, this provision will help investors assess a registrant\u2019s resiliency\nto impacts of climate-related risks, by providing information about how management considers\nthe realized or likely impacts of identified material climate-related risks on a company\u2019s business\nmodel or strategy.436\nIn further response to commenters\u2019 concern that the proposed rules were overly\nprescriptive and could result in a volume of information that could be confusing for investors,437\nwe have streamlined the Item 1502(c) disclosure requirement. For example, we have omitted\nfrom the final Item 1502(c) provision the proposed requirement to \u201c[p]rovide both current and\n433 See 17 CFR 229.1502(c).\n434 See infra section II.G.\n435 See infra section II.D.2.\n436 See supra note 402 and accompanying text.\n437 See supra note 415 and accompanying text; see also letters from API; Chamber; NAM; SIFMA; and Soc.\nCorp. Gov.\n118\n\nforward-looking disclosures,\u201d438 which should provide registrants with more flexibility to\ndetermine the appropriate disclosures needed in response to the requirement. We also have\neliminated the requirement to describe how any of the financial statement metrics or GHG\nemissions metrics relate to the registrant\u2019s business model or business strategy.439 Although a\nregistrant may choose to include forward-looking information or discuss any climate-related\nmetrics or financial information in response to Item 1502(c), the final rule leaves it up to each\nregistrant to determine, based on its particular facts and circumstances, what disclosure is\nnecessary to help investors understand whether and how management has incorporated the\nmaterial impacts of its climate-related risks into its business strategy, financial planning, and\ncapital allocation.\nIn addition, to further streamline the disclosure and reduce some of the redundancy in the\nrule proposal,440 we have eliminated from Item 1502(c) the proposed disclosure requirement\nconcerning the role that the use of carbon offsets or RECs has played in a registrant\u2019s climate-\nrelated strategy. Under the final rules, as part of its targets and goals disclosure,441 a registrant\nwill be required to provide disclosure concerning its use of carbon offsets or RECs if they\nconstitute a material component of a registrant\u2019s plan to achieve its climate-related targets or\ngoals.442 Given this targets and goals disclosure requirement, explicitly requiring disclosure\nconcerning the use of carbon offsets and RECs in the context of Item 1502(c) is not necessary.\n438 See Proposing Release, section II.C.1.\n439 See id.\n440 One commenter stated that the Commission should follow the TCFD\u2019s recommendation that \u201c[d]isclosures\nshould be eliminated if they are immaterial or redundant to avoid obscuring relevant information.\u201d Letter\nfrom Chamber.\n441 See infra section II.G.\n442 See 17 CFR 229.1504(d).\n119\n\nWe acknowledge the commenter who recommended that we delete the term \u201cbusiness\nmodel\u201d in the proposed disclosure item;443 however, we have retained the use of this term in the\nfinal rule because requiring a registrant to disclose a material impact on its business model\ncaused by a climate-related risk will provide important information to investors about the\neffectiveness of the registrant\u2019s climate risk management that would otherwise be lost were we to\nomit this reference. In addition, registrants generally should be familiar with the term even if not\npreviously used in Regulation S-K.444 Moreover, the TCFD uses that term in connection with\ndisclosure about the resilience of a company\u2019s strategy to climate-related risks, and as such,\nusing the concept in the final rules will provide consistency for those registrants that have been\nproviding climate-related information based on that framework.445 If a registrant has not yet\narticulated a business model, or does not believe that its business model is or will be materially\nimpacted by climate-related risks, it need not provide the disclosure specified in this rule\nprovision.\nProposed Item 1502(d) would have required a registrant to provide a narrative discussion\nof whether and how any climate-related risks described in response to proposed Item 1502(a)\nhave affected or are reasonably likely to affect the registrant\u2019s consolidated financial\nstatements.446 When proposing Item 1502(d), the Commission explained that this provision was\nintended to elicit a discussion of the financial effects of climate-related risks similar to\n443 See letter from ABA.\n444 See, e.g., business model, Oxford English Dictionary (2023), available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1093/OED/2631068139; and business model, Cambridge Business English Dictionary\n(2023), available at https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/business-model.\n445 See TCFD, supra note 159, at Table A2.1; IFRS, IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures (June 2023); See\nalso IFRS, IFRS S2 Accompanying Guidance on Climate-related Disclosures (June 2023).\n446 See Proposing Release, section II.C.1.\n120\n\nMD&A.447 In a clarifying change from the proposal, and to address commenters\u2019 concern that\nthe proposed rule could result in immaterial disclosure,448 we have added materiality qualifiers to\n\u201chave affected\u201d and \u201care reasonably likely to affect\u201d to clarify that Item 1502(d) requires a\ndiscussion only of material climate-related risks (i.e., climate-related risks that a registrant has\nidentified as having had or being reasonably likely to have a material effect on the registrant).449\nIn a further change from the proposal, the final rules refer to the registrant\u2019s \u201cbusiness, results of\noperations, and financial condition\u201d rather than \u201cconsolidated financial statements.\u201d This is to\nreflect that the type of disclosure that is intended by this provision is more similar to that found\nin MD&A than that found in the notes to the financial statements.450\nProposed Item 1502(d) also would have required a discussion that included the financial\nstatement metrics to be disclosed pursuant to proposed Article 14 of Regulation S-X. In a\nchange from the proposal, Item 1502(d)(2) will require a registrant to describe quantitatively and\nqualitatively the material expenditures incurred and material impacts on financial estimates and\nassumptions that, in management\u2019s assessment, directly result from activities to mitigate or adapt\nto climate-related risks disclosed pursuant to Item 1502(b)(4).451 Focusing the disclosure\nrequirement on material expenditures that, based on management\u2019s assessment, were incurred as\na direct result of the registrant\u2019s mitigation or adaptation activities will provide investors with a\nfinancial metric that is important to assessing the registrant\u2019s management of the disclosed risk,\n447 See id.\n448 See supra note 415 and accompanying text.\n449 See 17 CFR 229.1502(d)(1).\n450 As previously noted, several commenters recommended making or linking any climate-related financial\ndisclosure requirements under or with MD&A disclosure requirements. See supra note 409 and\naccompanying text.\n451 See 17 CFR 229.1502(d)(2).\n121\n\nas well as assessing the financial impact of such activities. At the same time, linking the\ndisclosure of the expenditures with management\u2019s assessment that they directly result from\nmitigation or adaptation activities will more closely align the disclosure requirement with how\nthe registrant actually evaluates a material climate-related risk. This will not only provide\ninvestors with important information about a registrant\u2019s strategic decision-making concerning a\nmaterial climate-related risk but should also help the registrant determine whether there are\nmaterial expenditures that must be disclosed, thereby lowering the compliance burden, as some\ncommenters noted.452\nThis disclosure requirement is intended to capture actual material expenditures, both\ncapitalized and expensed, made during the fiscal year for the purpose of climate-related risk\nmitigation or adaptation. As one commenter noted, requiring the disclosure of material\nexpenditures that are directly linked to a registrant\u2019s climate-related goals as part of a registrant\u2019s\nstrategy or targets and goals disclosure under Regulation S-K,453 instead of requiring the\ndisclosure of climate-related financial impacts on line items under Regulation S-X, as proposed,\nwill help reduce the compliance burden of the final rules while providing material information\nfor investors.454 Although this commenter recommended that such expenditures disclosure be\npresented in tabular format, the final rule provision does not specify a particular format. The\n452 See, e.g., letters from Amazon; and PwC.\n453 See infra sections II.D.2.c and II.G.3.a for a similar material expenditures disclosure requirement,\nrespectively, as part of a registrant\u2019s transition plan disclosure under Item 1502(e) and targets and goals\ndisclosure under Item 1504 of Regulation S-K. To the extent that there is any overlapping disclosure of\nmaterial expenditures in response to these Items, to avoid redundancy, a registrant should provide\ndisclosure of material expenditures regarding the Item where, in its assessment, such disclosure is most\nappropriate, and then cross-reference to this disclosure when responding to the other Items.\n454 See letter from Amazon. As examples of transition activities expenditures, this commenter presented costs\nand expenses related to electrifying its delivery fleet, renewable energy purchases, and carbon offset\npurchases. See id., Appendix A.\n122\n\nfinal rule also does not require disclosure of \u201cdiscrete and separable\u201d expenditures, as the\ncommenter suggested. A registrant may present the material expenditures disclosure in tabular\nor narrative form according to how it believes such information best fits within its overall\nclimate risk disclosure.455 Likewise, the final rules provide registrants with more flexibility than\nthat suggested by the commenter to determine which and to what extent expenditures must be\ndisaggregated or otherwise broken out. This disclosure requirement covers material expenditures\nfor the mitigation or adaptation of both physical risks and transition risks. The final Regulation\nS-X provisions that we are adopting, on the other hand, do not cover financial impacts caused by\ntransition risks.456 This Regulation S-K provision, therefore, will elicit disclosures about\nmaterial expenditures related to activities engaged in for the mitigation of and adaptation to\nclimate-related risks in Commission filings while avoiding the difficulties of reporting such\ninformation in a note to the financial statements, as proposed.457\nAs discussed in more detail below,458 we recognize that some commenters on the\nproposed Regulation S-X amendments expressed concern regarding the attribution of expenses\nto climate risk mitigation activities. Specifically, these commenters stated that registrants make\nbusiness decisions, such as incurring an expenditure to purchase a piece of machinery that is\n455 The structured data requirements set forth in Item 1508 will facilitate investors\u2019 ability to find and analyze\nmaterial expenditures disclosure regardless of whether provided in tabular or narrative form. See infra\nsection II.M.3.\n456 See infra section II.K. In addition, in a change from the proposal, the amendments to Regulation S-X do\nnot require the disclosure of expenditures to mitigate the risks of severe weather events and other natural\nconditions. Therefore, under Item 1502, investors will also receive information about expenditures related\nto the mitigation of physical risks that they will not otherwise receive in the disclosures required by the\namendments to Regulation S-X.\n457 See supra notes 409 and 452 and accompanying text. The amendments to Regulation S-X will require the\ndisclosure of expenditures related to carbon offsets and RECs, a type of transition activity, if carbon offsets\nand RECs have been used as a material component of a registrant\u2019s plans to achieve its disclosed climate-\nrelated targets or goals in a note to the financial statements.

In addition, in responding to the final\nrules, registrants will have the flexibility to explain qualitatively the nature of the expenditure\nand how management has determined that it is a direct result of the disclosed transition activities,\nwhich may help alleviate concerns about potential liability exposure for attribution decisions.460\nRequiring the disclosure of material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions that,\nfrom management\u2019s assessment, directly result from mitigation or adaptation activities will also\nprovide investors with important information that will help them understand a registrant\u2019s\nclimate risk management and assess any effects on its asset valuation and securities pricing.461\nRegistrants will similarly have the flexibility to explain qualitatively the nature of the impact on\nfinancial estimates and assumptions and how, in management\u2019s assessment, it is a direct result of\nthe disclosed mitigation or adaptation activities.\nWe recognize that registrants may need to develop new systems and adjust their DCPs to\nensure the accurate tracking and reporting of material expenditures and material impacts on\n459 See infra note 1892 and accompanying text.\n460 We note also that the \u201csignificant contributing factor\u201d attribution principle applicable to certain disclosures\nrequired by the final rules in the financial statements, as well as any other guidance we provide below\nregarding the presentation of the disclosures in the financial statements, does not pertain to the expenditure\ndisclosure in Regulation S-K.

Proposed Rule\nThe Commission proposed to require a registrant that has adopted a transition plan as part\nof its climate-related risk management strategy to describe the plan, including the relevant\nmetrics and targets used to identify and manage any physical and transition risks.464 The\nproposed requirements were intended to help investors understand how a registrant intends to\naddress identified climate-related risks and any transition to a lower carbon economy while\nmanaging and assessing its business operations and financial condition. The Commission\nproposed to define \u201ctransition plan\u201d to mean a registrant\u2019s strategy and implementation plan to\nreduce climate-related risks, which may include a plan to reduce its GHG emissions in line with\nits own commitments or commitments of jurisdictions within which it has significant operations.\nTo allow for an understanding of a registrant\u2019s progress to meet its plan\u2019s targets or goals over\n462 See, e.g., letters from ABA; Cohn Rez; HP; and IMA.\n463 We are providing the same one-year phase in for the material expenditures disclosure requirements being\nadopted in connection with a transition plan or a target and goal.

The Commission proposed to require transition plan disclosure in\nconnection with a registrant\u2019s risk management discussion. The final rules include transition plan\ndisclosure as part of a registrant\u2019s disclosure about climate-related risks and their impact on the registrant\u2019s\nstrategy to be consistent with TCFD\u2019s recommended transition plan disclosure. See, e.g., TCFD, Guidance\non Metrics, Targets, and Transition Plans (Oct. 2021), available at\nhttps://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/60/2021/07/2021-Metrics_Targets_Guidance-1.pdf.\n125\n\ntime, the proposed rules would have required the registrant to update its disclosure about its\ntransition plan each fiscal year by describing the actions taken during the year to achieve the\nplan\u2019s targets or goals.465\nThe proposed rules would have further required a registrant that has adopted a transition\nplan to discuss, as applicable:\n\u2022 How the registrant plans to mitigate or adapt to any identified physical risks, including\nbut not limited to those concerning energy, land, or water use and management; and\n\u2022 How the registrant plans to mitigate or adapt to any identified transition risks, including\nthe following:\nLaws, regulations, or policies that:\no\n\uf0a7 Restrict GHG emissions or products with high GHG footprints, including\nemissions caps; or\n\uf0a7 Require the protection of high conservation value land or natural assets;\nImposition of a carbon price; and\no\nChanging demands or preferences of consumers, investors, employees, and business\no\ncounterparties.\nThe proposed rules provided that a registrant that has adopted a transition plan may also\ndescribe how it plans to achieve any identified climate-related opportunities, such as:\n\u2022 The production of products that may facilitate the transition to a lower carbon economy,\nsuch as low emission modes of transportation and supporting infrastructure;\n\u2022 The generation or use of renewable power;\n465 See Proposing Release, section II.E.2.\n126"

Comments\nMany commenters supported the proposed provision requiring a registrant that has\nadopted a transition plan to describe the plan, including the relevant metrics and targets used to\nidentify and manage any physical and transition risks.466 Commenters stated that information\nabout a registrant\u2019s transition plan would help investors evaluate the seriousness of stated\ncorporate intentions to identify and manage climate-related risks, including the credibility of\nclimate-related targets and progress made toward those targets.467 Several commenters stated\nthat information regarding a registrant\u2019s transition plan is important to help investors evaluate a\nregistrant\u2019s management of its identified climate-related risks and help them assess the resiliency\nof a registrant\u2019s strategy in a potential transition to a lower carbon economy.468 Some\ncommenters specifically supported requiring disclosure, as applicable, of a registrant\u2019s plan to\nmitigate or adapt to identified physical risks, as proposed, and further stated that there are no\ntransition risks, as identified in the rule proposal, that should be excluded from the transition plan\ndisclosure requirement.469 Other commenters stated that the proposed requirement would help\n466 See, e.g., letters from Amer. for Fin.

    "text": "to the adoption of a transition plan because companies that intend to follow through on their\ntransition plan commitments will want to assess their progress in achieving them and report on\nsuch progress and any climate-related opportunities they may be pursuing.490\nOther commenters, however, opposed the proposed updating requirement.491 One\ncommenter stated that the proposed requirement would be burdensome for registrants and would\nact as a disincentive to the adoption of a transition plan.492 Another commenter stated that, due\nto the long timeline of transition plans, annual progress updates would in many cases not provide\nmeaningful information for investors.493 This commenter recommended that there should\ninstead be a requirement to annually report any actions taken to achieve transition plans that are\nmaterial to the registrant, as well as any material positive or negative deviations from the plan or\nchanges to it that are material to the registrant.494 Another commenter stated that a registrant\nshould have to update its transition plan disclosure only when the registrant believes it is\nappropriate to do so, and such updating should occur at most on an annual basis.495\nc. Final rule\nAfter considering comments received, we are adopting, with modifications from the\nproposal, a final rule provision (Item 1502(e)) that will require a registrant to describe a\ntransition plan if it has adopted the plan to manage a material transition risk.496 Like the rule\nproposal, the final rules define (in Item 1500) a \u201ctransition plan\u201d to mean a registrant\u2019s strategy\n490 See, e.g., letters from Anthesis; and IATP.\n491 See, e.g., letters from CEMEX; and SIFMA.\n492 See letter from CEMEX.\n493 See letter from SIFMA.\n494 See id.\n495 See letter from Unilever.\n496 See 17 CFR 229.1502(e).\n131\n\nand implementation plan to reduce climate-related risks, which may include a plan to reduce its\nGHG emissions in line with its own commitments or commitments of jurisdictions within which\nit has significant operations.497 The final rules do not mandate that registrants adopt a transition\nplan; if a registrant does not have a plan, no disclosure is required.\nAs noted in the Proposing Release, registrants may adopt transition plans to mitigate or\nadapt to climate-related risks as an important part of their climate-related risk management\nstrategy, particularly if the registrant has made commitments, or operates in a jurisdiction that\nhas made commitments, to reduce its GHG emissions.498 We recognize that not every registrant\nhas a transition plan and, as noted above, this rulemaking does not seek to prescribe any\nparticular tools, strategies, or practices with respect to climate-related risks. If, however, a\nregistrant has adopted such a plan, information regarding the plan is important to help investors\nevaluate a registrant\u2019s management of its identified climate-related risks and assess the potential\nimpacts of a registrant\u2019s strategy to achieve its short- or long-term climate-related targets or\ngoals on its business, results of operations, and/or its financial condition. Moreover, a\nregistrant\u2019s transition plan may have a significant impact on its overall business strategy, for\nexample, where companies operate in jurisdictions with laws or regulations in place designed to\nmove them away from high emissions products and services.499 Because the steps a registrant\nplans to take pursuant to its transition plan may have a material impact on its business, results of\noperations, or financial condition, investors have sought more detailed disclosure about transition\nplans.500\n497 See 17 CFR 229.1500 (definition of \u201ctransition plan\u201d).\n498 See Proposing Release, section II.E.2.\n499 See supra section II.A.\n500 See, e.g., letters from AGs of Cal. et al.; BNP Paribas; and Morningstar.\n132\n\nWe disagree with commenters that stated that transition plan disclosure should be\nvoluntary501 and that a transition plan disclosure requirement was not necessary because the\nCommission\u2019s existing business description rules would arguably elicit sufficient disclosure of a\nregistrant\u2019s transition plan.502 As other commenters noted, many registrants are not providing\ndecision-useful information about their transition plans under the Commission\u2019s existing\ndisclosure rules.503 While existing Item 101 of Regulation S-K may result in some disclosure\nregarding transition plans in response to the general requirements of that rule, mandatory\ndisclosure about transition plans will help ensure that investors receive the information they need\nto evaluate a registrant\u2019s management of material climate-related risks and the impact of those\nplans on its results of operations and financial condition in a more consistent and predictable\nmanner.\nWe are cognizant, however, of commenters\u2019 concerns that the proposed transition plan\ndisclosure provision was overly prescriptive and could result in immaterial disclosure or\ndiscourage registrants from adopting a transition plan to avoid having to describe the plan in\ndetail.504 To address these concerns, we have significantly streamlined the transition plan\ndisclosure provision and revised the provision so that the description of a transition plan is only\nrequired if a registrant has adopted the plan to manage a material transition risk. Unlike the\nproposed rule, the final rule does not list the types of transition risks and factors related to those\nrisks that must be disclosed, if applicable.505 Instead, a registrant that is required to provide\n501 See supra note 483 and accompanying text.\n502 See supra note 480 and accompanying text.\n503 See supra note 470 and accompanying text.\n504 See supra notes 478 and 481 and accompanying text.\n505 See Proposing Release, section II.E.2.\n133\n\ntransition plan disclosure will have the flexibility to provide disclosure that addresses the\nparticular facts and circumstances of its material transition risk.506 We also note that, as with\nscenario analysis and use of internal carbon price disclosure, a registrant\u2019s transition plan\ndisclosure will be subject to a safe harbor.507\nSimilar to the proposed rule, the final rule requires a registrant to update its annual report\ndisclosure about the transition plan each fiscal year by describing any actions taken during the\nyear under the plan, including how such actions have impacted the registrant\u2019s business, results\nof operations, or financial condition.508 This updating requirement will help investors\nunderstand the registrant\u2019s progress under the plan over time, track the impacts of a transition\nplan on a registrant\u2019s business and, as noted by commenters, help inform investment\ndecisions.509 We disagree with the view of commenters who stated that this updating\nrequirement would result in disclosure of information that is not meaningful for investors.510\nInvestors have indicated that they need periodic information regarding the steps a registrant has\ntaken to achieve an announced climate-related target or goal in order to evaluate a registrant\u2019s\nongoing management of a material transition risk for the purpose of informing their investment\n506 As discussed above, transition risk is defined as the actual or potential negative impacts on a registrant\u2019s\nbusiness, results of operations, or financial condition attributable to regulatory, technological, and market\nchanges to address the mitigation of, or adaptation to, climate-related risks, such as increased costs\nattributable to changes in law or policy, reduced market demand for carbon-intensive products leading to\ndecreased prices or profits for such products, the devaluation or abandonment of assets, risk of legal\nliability and litigation defense costs, competitive pressures associated with the adoption of new\ntechnologies, and reputational impacts (including those stemming from a registrant\u2019s customers or business\ncounterparties) that might trigger changes to market behavior, consumer preferences or behavior, and\nregistrant behavior. See 17 CFR 229.1500.\n507 See infra section II.J.3.\n508 See 17 CFR 229.1502(e)(1).\n509 See supra note 488 and accompanying text.\n510 See supra note 490 and accompanying text.\n134\n\nor voting decisions.511 Once a registrant has provided disclosure about a transition plan it has\nadopted to manage a material climate risk, we do not expect that it would be particularly\nburdensome for the company to disclose updated information about actions taken under the plan\non a going forward basis.512 Disclosure of the steps a registrant intends to make under a\ntransition plan, and whether it has taken those steps, will help investors assess the financial\nimpacts of the plan on the registrant\u2019s business, results of operations, or financial condition.513\nMoreover, requiring this information on an annual basis will allow investors to take into account\ncurrent climate-related information in their investment and voting decisions more consistently\nthan they would be able to if registrants were required to update their climate-related information\nless frequently or only when they deemed it appropriate.514\nWe recognize that some commenters asserted that an updating requirement would act as a\ndisincentive to the adoption of a transition plan. This effect may be attenuated, as some\ncommenters indicated,515 if registrants that have disclosed a plan wish to inform investors about\nprogress achieved pursuant to the plan. In any event, if a registrant is using a transition plan to\nmanage a material transition risk, we think it is appropriate for registrants to provide ongoing\ndisclosure about the plan so that investors can assess its impact on the registrant\u2019s business.516\nAs previously noted, however, we are agnostic about whether or how a registrant is managing its\n511 See, e.g., letters from AGs of Cal. et al.; Amer. for Fin. Reform, Sunrise Project et al.; Anthesis; BNP\nParibas; CalPERS; CalSTRS; Ceres; and Morningstar.\n512 We note that such an update would not be required where disclosure of the underlying transition plan\nwould not be currently required (e.g., because the plan is no longer used to manage a material transition\nrisk).\n513 See, e.g., letters from AGs of Cal. et al.; BNP Paribas; and Morningstar.\n514 See supra note 495 and accompanying text.\n515 See supra note 490 and accompanying text.\n516 To the extent that a registrant no longer uses a transition plan to manage a material climate risk, disclosure\nunder this item, including the requirement for updates, would not be required.\n135\n\nclimate-related risks, and the final rules are intended neither to incentivize nor disincentivize the\nuse of a transition plan or any other climate risk management tool.\nIn a modification of the proposed rule, which would have generally required the\ndisclosure of the relevant metrics and targets used to identify and manage transition risk under a\ntransition plan, the final rule will require a registrant, as part of its updating disclosure, to include\nquantitative and qualitative disclosure of material expenditures incurred and material impacts on\nfinancial estimates and assumptions as a direct result of the disclosed actions taken under the\nplan.517 While this provision is similar to Item 1502(d), Item 1502(e) differs in that it is intended\nto elicit disclosure about material expenditures and material impacts on financial estimates and\nassumptions that directly result from actions taken under a transition plan (e.g., material\nexpenditures made for climate-related research and development). Item 1502(e) is not limited to\ndisclosure concerning expenditures and impacts that directly result from mitigation or adaptation\nactivities;518 however, to the extent that a registrant\u2019s disclosure made in response to Item\n1502(d) or Item 1502(e) overlap with each other or with disclosure required under any other\nsubpart 1500 provision,519 the registrant need not repeat the disclosure.\nSimilar to Item 1502(d), the disclosure requirement under Item 1502(e) is intended to\ncapture material expenditures, both capitalized and expensed, made during the fiscal year under a\n517 See 17 CFR 229.1502(e)(2).\n518 See supra section II.D.1.c for a discussion of Item 1502(d)(2)\u2019s requirement to disclose material\nexpenditures and material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions directly resulting from mitigation\nor adaptation activities.\n519 For example, Item 1504(c)(2) requires similar disclosure regarding material impacts that directly result\nfrom actions taken by a registrant to achieve a disclosed target or goal. See infra section II.G.3. To the\nextent that there is any overlapping disclosure of material expenditures in response to Items 1502(d)(2),\n1502(e), and 1504(c)(2), to avoid redundancy, a registrant should provide disclosure of material\nexpenditures regarding the Item where, in its assessment, such disclosure is most appropriate, and then\ncross-reference to this disclosure when responding to the other Items.\n136\n\ntransition plan, and to more closely align with how the registrant actually makes strategic\ndecisions about taking actions under a transition plan. This provision will provide an important\nmetric to help investors assess a registrant\u2019s climate risk management and the financial impact of\na transition plan while also helping to limit the compliance burden, as some commenters\nnoted.520 We have not qualified Item 1502(e) by referring to management\u2019s assessment as we\nhave done in Item 1502(d) (i.e., material expenditures and material impacts that, in\nmanagement\u2019s assessment, directly result from the disclosed actions). We believe that if a\nregistrant has adopted a transition plan to manage a material transition risk, it is likely that\nmanagement will oversee actions taken under the plan and, therefore, any material expenditures\nor material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions that are disclosed will have been\nassessed by management as being the direct result of such actions.\nAs under Item 1502(d), when responding to Item 1502(e), a registrant will have\nflexibility to explain qualitatively the nature of a material expenditure or material impact on its\nfinancial estimates or assumptions and how it directly resulted from the disclosed actions taken\nunder the plan. Additionally, when considering which expenditures related to actions taken\nunder a disclosed plan are material over the relevant period and therefore require disclosure, if\nindividual expenditures do not appear to be material, registrants should consider whether overall\nexpenditures related to actions taken under the plan are material in the aggregate and, if so,\nprovide appropriate disclosure. For example, a series of individually immaterial expenditures\ncould be the result of the same action or related actions under the plan, and those expenditures\ncould be material in the aggregate. With respect to the disclosure of material impacts on\nfinancial estimates and assumptions as a direct result of the disclosed actions, to the extent that\n520 See, e.g., letters from Amazon; and PWC.\n137\n\nsuch information is disclosed in response to Rule 14-02(h) of Regulation S-X, a registrant would\nbe able to cross-reference to such disclosure.521\nSimilar to Item 1502(d)(2), to allow for the development of systems, controls, and\nprocedures to track and report material expenditures and material impacts on financial estimates\nand assumptions directly resulting from actions taken under a transition plan, we are phasing in\ncompliance with Item 1502(e)(2). A registrant will not be required to comply with either\nprovision until the fiscal year immediately following the fiscal year of its initial compliance date\nfor the subpart 1500 rules based on its filer status.522\nAs recommended by one commenter,523 we have removed the reference to physical risks\nthat was in the proposed rule.524 This change will make the transition plan disclosure\nrequirement more consistent with voluntary disclosures that are based on the TCFD\u2019s\nrecommendations,525 which may mitigate the costs and complexity of complying with the final\nrule for registrants already familiar with the TCFD\u2019s framework.526 A registrant that faces a\nmaterial physical risk, however, will still be required to disclose how it is managing that risk as\npart of its risk management disclosure.527 These revisions will elicit material information for\n521 We remind registrants that while they are permitted to cross-reference to information in their financial\nstatements to satisfy their Regulation S-K disclosure obligations, they are not permitted to cross-reference\nto Regulation S-K disclosures in their financial statements, unless otherwise specifically permitted or\nrequired by the Commission\u2019s rules or by U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d)\nor International Financial Reporting Standards (\u201cIFRS\u201d) as issued by the International Accounting\nStandards Board (\u201cIASB\u201d), whichever is applicable. See 17 CFR 230.411 and 17 CFR 240.12b-23.\n522 See infra section II.O.3.\n523 See letter from PRI.\n524 See Proposing Release, section II.E.2.\n525 See TCFD, Guidance on Metrics, Targets, and Transition Plans section E (Oct. 2021), available at\nhttps://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/60/2021/07/2021-Metrics_Targets_Guidance-1.pdf.\n526 See, e.g., infra note 2690 and accompanying text (describing a report finding that 50 percent of\nsustainability reports from Russell 1000 companies aligned with the TCFD recommendations).\n527 See 17 CFR 229.1503, discussed infra section II.F.\n138\n\ninvestors about how a registrant intends to reduce its exposure to a material transition risk while\nlimiting the burdens on registrants and providing them more flexibility to determine what aspects\nof the transition plan should be disclosed in light of their facts and circumstances.\nWe are cognizant that some commenters expressed concern that the proposed transition\nplan disclosure requirement would result in the disclosure of confidential or proprietary\ninformation that could cause competitive harm to the registrant.528 Modifying the transition plan\ndisclosure provision to focus on material expenditures and material impacts on financial\nestimates and assumptions, rather than all relevant metrics and targets, will help to mitigate this\nconcern by providing registrants with more flexibility to determine what is necessary to disclose\nin order to describe the plan. Similarly, modifying the transition plan disclosure provision to\nrequire disclosure only when a plan has been adopted to manage a material transition risk will\nfurther help to mitigate this concern. This added flexibility regarding transition plan disclosure\nwill also help address concerns that the final rule could act as a disincentive to adoption of\ntransition plans.529 While the final rules seek neither to incentivize nor disincentivize the\nadoption of transition plans, we recognize that the compliance burdens of disclosure may\ninfluence some registrants\u2019 decisions with respect to risk management practices and have\ntherefore sought to mitigate such effects.\nWe decline to follow the recommendation of one commenter to limit the transition plan\ndisclosure requirement to only material transition plans that have been formally approved by a\nregistrant\u2019s board of directors.530 We do not believe that board approval should be the\n528 See supra note 479 and accompanying text.\n529 See, e.g., letters from CEMEX; and SIFMA.\n530 See supra note 482 and accompanying text.\n139"

More generally, scenario analysis is a process for identifying and assessing a potential range of\noutcomes of future events under conditions of uncertainty.

    "text": "underlying the scenario analysis, as proposed.556 One commenter stated that scenario analysis\ndisclosure should only be required when it is broadly used by senior management and the board\nas part of their strategic planning process and when integrated and material to a publicly\nannounced climate-related strategy or initiative.557\nSome commenters recommended that the Commission require the use of certain publicly\navailable scenario models, such as those published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate\nChange (\u201cIPCC\u201d), the International Energy Agency (\u201cIEA\u201d), or the Network of Central Banks\nand Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (\u201cNGFS\u201d), to enhance the comparability of\nthe scenario analysis disclosure.558 Other commenters stated that it should be up to each\nregistrant to choose those scenarios that best fit its particular business or industry and tailor its\ndisclosure accordingly.559\nc. Final Rule\nWe are adopting a final rule (Item 1502(f)) requiring the disclosure of scenario analysis\nunder certain circumstances. The disclosure of a registrant\u2019s use of scenario analysis can provide\nimportant forward-looking information to help investors evaluate the resilience of the registrant\u2019s\nstrategy under various climate-related circumstances.560 Scenario analysis has increasingly been\nrecognized as an important analytical tool in assessing a company\u2019s climate-related risk\n556 See, e.g., letters from ABA; and Chevron.\n557 See letter from Amazon.\n558 See, e.g., letters from Anthesis; Bloomberg; CalSTRS; Chevron; and Shell plc (June 17, 2022) (\u201cShell\u201d).\n559 See, e.g., letters from American Council of Life Insurers (June 17, 2022) (\u201cACLI\u201d); J. Herron; and\nTotalEnergies.\n560 See supra notes 540-542 and accompanying text.\n145\n\nexposure,561 and investors have increasingly sought information from registrants about their use\nof scenario analysis and expressed a need for improved disclosure about such use.562\nAlthough some commenters recommended that we require all registrants to include\nscenario analysis disclosure in their climate risk reporting,563 we recognize that not every\nregistrant conducts scenario analysis and, as noted above, this rulemaking does not seek to\nprescribe any particular tools, strategies, or practices with respect to climate-related risks but\nrather, when material, to provide investors with the information they need to evaluate the\nclimate-related risks faced by the registrant and their potential impacts on the registrant\u2019s\nbusiness, results of operations, or financial condition. Therefore, similar to the proposed rule,\nthe final rule\u2019s scenario analysis disclosure requirement will depend on whether and how a\nregistrant uses such analysis. Importantly, the rule will not require any registrant to conduct\nscenario analysis.\nWe are, however, adopting modifications in the final rules. For example, we have added\na materiality qualifier regarding the disclosure of scenario analysis to address commenters\u2019\nconcern that the proposed requirement could result in disclosure of immaterial information that\n561 See, e.g., letter from AllianceBernstein (stating that \u201c[s]cenario analysis is particularly important for those\nregistrants in emissions-intensive industries where such analysis can demonstrate the quality of impairment\ntesting and increase confidence in asset values\u201d). The Federal Reserve Board\u2019s climate scenario analysis\npilot program, in which six of the nation's largest banks are voluntarily participating, further demonstrates\nthe increased recognition of scenario analysis as an important tool to assess climate-related financial risks.\nSee Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Reserve Board announces that six of the\nnation\u2019s largest banks will participate in a pilot climate scenario analysis exercise designed to enhance the\nability of supervisors and firms to measure and manage climate-related financial risks (Sept. 29, 2022),\navailable at https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20220929a.htm.\n562 See, e.g., letters from AllianceBernstein (stating that \u201c[w]hile many registrants claim to perform scenario\nanalysis, however, there is little disclosure around assumptions used in these models and how registrants\nuse results impact strategy, business and capital allocation decisions, making their results challenging to\ncompare\u201d); and Ceres (citing evidence from the Climate Action 100+ Benchmark that companies\u2019\n\u201cscenario analyses leave much room for improvement\u201d).\n563 See supra note 543 and accompanying text.\n146\n\nwould be burdensome and costly to produce.564 We also note that, as with transition plan and\nuse of internal carbon price disclosure, a registrant\u2019s scenario analysis disclosure will be subject\nto a safe harbor.565 The final rule provides that, if a registrant uses scenario analysis566 to assess\nthe impact of climate-related risks on its business, results of operations, or financial condition,\nand if, based on the results of scenario analysis, a registrant determines that a climate-related risk\nis reasonably likely to have a material impact on its business, results of operations, or financial\ncondition, then the registrant must describe each such scenario,567 including a brief description of\nthe parameters, assumptions, and analytical choices used, as well as the expected material\nimpacts, including financial impacts, on the registrant under each such scenario.568 We are\nadopting this disclosure requirement because, if a registrant has used scenario analysis to assess\nand manage a material climate-related risk, investors need to understand how it conducted that\nanalysis in order to evaluate the registrant\u2019s conclusions regarding material impacts on its\nbusiness, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe also have streamlined the proposed scenario analysis disclosure requirements to\nreduce redundancy in the final rules. For example, we have eliminated the introductory\n564 See supra note 554 and accompanying text.\n565 See infra section II.J.3.\n566 We are largely adopting the definition of scenario analysis, as proposed. See 17 CFR 229.1500 (\u201cScenario\nanalysis means a process for identifying and assessing a potential range of outcomes of various possible\nfuture climate scenarios, and how climate-related risks may impact a registrant\u2019s business strategy, results\nof operations, and financial condition over time.\u201d) We have deleted from the definition the example that\n\u201cregistrants might use scenario analysis to test the resilience of their strategies under certain future climate\nscenarios, such as those that assume global temperature increases of 3 \u00b0C, 2 \u00b0C, and 1.5 \u00baC above pre-\nindustrial levels\u201d because we do not wish to convey the impression that these scenarios are required should\na registrant elect to conduct scenario analysis.\n567 See 17 CFR 229.1502(f). Conversely, if a registrant conducts scenario analysis and determines from its\nresults that it is not likely to be materially impacted by a climate-related risk, no disclosure about its use of\nscenario analysis is required under Item 1502(f).\n568 See id.\n147\n\nprovision in the rule proposal requiring a registrant to describe the resilience of its business\nstrategy in light of potential future changes in climate-related risks. Because companies use\nscenario analysis to test the resilience of their business strategies under varying future climate\nscenarios, and because such use is explained in the definition of scenario analysis (in Item 1500)\nthat we are adopting largely as proposed,569 if registrants are required to disclose their use of\nscenario analysis under the final rules, such disclosure likely would include a description of the\nresilience of their strategies under various climate scenarios.\nThe rule proposal would have required a registrant to disclose \u201cany analytical tools, such\nas scenario analysis\u201d that it uses to assess the impact of climate-related risks on its business. In a\nmodification of the proposed rule, we have eliminated the reference to \u201cany analytical tools\u201d to\nclarify that the disclosure required by this provision should concern the registrant\u2019s use of\nscenario analysis rather than any other analytical tools. We note that the TCFD\u2019s guidance\ndiscusses scenario analysis as the primary tool to help companies assess the impacts of climate-\nrelated risks on their business strategies, and therefore this change should eliminate any\nconfusion about what other analytical tools might fall under the scope of the requirements.570\nIn another change from the rule proposal, we have added the term \u201cbrief\u201d to modify the\n\u201cdescription of the parameters, assumptions, and analytical choices used\u201d prong of the scenario\nanalysis disclosure provision. The adopted provision will continue to elicit disclosure that will\nenhance investors\u2019 assessment of the resiliency of a registrant\u2019s strategy while also mitigating the\ncompliance burden for registrants. Requiring a brief description of the parameters, assumptions,\nand analytical choices used, together with a description of the projected material financial\n569 See 17 CFR 229.1500.\n570 See TCFD, supra note 332332.\n148\n\nimpacts on the registrant\u2019s business strategy under each scenario, should help elicit disclosure\nthat neither burdens investors with immaterial detail nor unduly adds to a registrant\u2019s compliance\nburden. As with disclosure related to transition plans, we reiterate that our focus in adopting\nthese requirements is neither on incentivizing nor disincentivizing any particular risk\nmanagement practice but rather on providing investors with the information they need with\nrespect to the particular practices of a registrant in order to make informed investment and voting\ndecisions.\nThese revisions to the proposed rule also address commenters\u2019 concern that the required\nscenario analysis disclosure could result in the disclosure of confidential business information.571\nIf a registrant has used scenario analysis to determine that an identified climate-related risk is\nlikely to have a material impact on its business, results of operations, or financial condition, it is\nimportant for investors to receive disclosure about that material impact. The registrant will not,\nhowever, be required to provide a lengthy description of the underlying parameters and\nassumptions that may be more likely to reveal confidential business information.\nAlthough some commenters recommended that we require the use of one or more climate\nscenario models,572 the final rules do not impose any specific risk management model. By\nrequiring disclosure based on whether a registrant has determined to conduct scenario analysis as\npart of its consideration of material climate-related risks, a registrant will be able to select the\nclimate scenario model or models that it believes best fits its particular industry or business, or\nits climate risk assessment approach. This approach will provide useful information to investors\n571 See supra note 552 and accompanying text.\n572 See supra note 558 and accompanying text.\n149\n\nabout the resilience of a registrant\u2019s climate-related business strategy while also helping to limit\nthe registrant\u2019s compliance burden relating to scenario analysis disclosure under the final rules.\nThe proposed scenario analysis disclosure provision would have included as an example\nof potential scenarios to be considered \u201can increase of no greater than 3 \u00baC, 2 \u00baC, or 1.5 \u00baC above\npre-industrial levels.\u201d573 Because this was for illustrative purposes only, and because we have\nremoved the same example from the definition of scenario analysis to avoid conveying the\nimpression that these scenarios are required,574 we have also removed the example from Item\n1502(f).\nTo further streamline the scenario analysis disclosure requirement, we have removed the\nproposed provision stating that the disclosure should include both qualitative and quantitative\ninformation.575 We recognize that, as noted by some commenters, scenario analysis practices are\nstill evolving,576 and that, in the early stages of use, a registrant\u2019s disclosure regarding its use of\nscenario analysis may be qualitative. As a registrant\u2019s use of scenario analysis becomes more\nsophisticated, we would expect its disclosure of the results of scenario analysis to become more\nquantitative, particularly when discussing the expected material financial impacts on the\nregistrant\u2019s business strategy, under each considered scenario, which, like the proposed rule,\nmust be addressed should a registrant be required to disclose its use of scenario analysis.\nStreamlining the proposed scenario analysis disclosure requirement in this way will enable a\nregistrant to determine the mix of qualitative and quantitative disclosure that best fits its\nparticular circumstances when satisfying its obligations under the final rule.\n573 See Proposing Release, section II.C.4.\n574 See supra note 566 and accompanying text.\n575 See id.\n576 See, e.g., letters from Bloomberg; and Chamber.\n150"

Comments\nSeveral commenters supported the rule proposal requiring a registrant to disclose\ninformation about a maintained internal carbon price because of the important role played by\ninternal carbon pricing in the management of climate-related risks.581 One commenter stated that\ninternal carbon pricing has become an important mechanism to help companies manage risks and\ncapitalize on emerging opportunities in the transition to a low-carbon economy.582 According to\nthis commenter, in the event that governments adopt a carbon tax, registrants that have not begun\nusing internal carbon pricing could find themselves increasingly vulnerable due to their failure to\ninternalize the cost into their business.583 A different commenter stated that an internal carbon\nprice is a multifaceted tool that enables a registrant to embed a shadow cost for carbon in all\ncarbon mitigation investment decisions, or impose an internal carbon fee by charging business\nunits for their emissions and using the revenue generated to support investment into clean\ntechnologies.584 Other commenters similarly stated that an internal carbon price can assist\ncompanies in steering capital expenditures, research and design, and other financing decisions\n580 See id.\n581 See, e.g., letters from AGs of Cal. et al.; AllianceBernstein; Amer. for Fin.

Final Rule\nThe final rule (Item 1502(g)) will require a registrant that uses internal carbon pricing to\ndisclose certain information about the internal carbon price, if such use is material to how it\nevaluates and manages a climate-related risk that, in response to Item 1502(a), it has identified as\nhaving materially impacted or is reasonably likely to have a material impact on the registrant,\nincluding on its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.607 As\ncommenters have noted, many registrants use internal carbon pricing as a planning tool, among\nother purposes: to help identify climate-related risks and opportunities; as an incentive to drive\nenergy efficiencies to reduce costs; to quantify the potential costs the company would incur\nshould a carbon tax be put into effect; and to guide capital investment decisions.608 Information\nabout a registrant\u2019s use of internal carbon pricing will help investors evaluate how a registrant is\nmanaging climate-related risks, particularly transition risks, and the effectiveness of its business\nstrategy to mitigate or adapt to such risks.\nAt the same time, we recognize commenters\u2019 concern that, without a materiality qualifier,\nthe proposed rule could have resulted in the disclosure of internal carbon pricing data that would\n606 See letter from Chevron (recommending \u201ca disclosure requirement similar to FASB Accounting Standards\nCodification (ASC) 932, which requires a standardized measure of discounted future cash flows relating to\nproved oil and gas reserves quantities, often referred to as the standardized measure of oil and gas, or\nSMOG\u201d).\n607 See 17 CFR 229.1502(g).\n608 See supra notes 581-585 and accompanying text. We also note, based on current voluntary reporting, an\nincreasing trend among public companies to use internal carbon pricing. See CDP, Putting a Price on\nCarbon (2021), available at https://cdn.cdp.net/cdp-\nproduction/cms/reports/documents/000/005/651/original/CDP_Global_Carbon_Price_report_2021.pdf.\n156\n\nnot be decision-useful for investors and would be burdensome for registrants to produce.609 To\naddress this concern, in a change from the proposed rule, which would have required internal\ncarbon pricing disclosure whenever a registrant maintains an internal carbon price, the final rule\nwill require this disclosure only when the registrant\u2019s use of internal carbon pricing is material to\nhow it evaluates and manages a climate-related risk identified in response to Item 1502(a).\nIf a registrant\u2019s use of internal carbon pricing is material, similar to the proposed rule, the\nfinal rule will require it to disclose in units of the registrant\u2019s reporting currency:\n\u2022 The price per metric ton of CO e; and\n2\n\u2022 The total price, including how the total price is estimated to change over the time periods\nreferenced in Item 1502(a), as applicable.610\nSimilar to the proposed rule, if a registrant uses more than one internal carbon price to\nevaluate and manage a material climate-related risk, it must provide the required disclosures for\neach internal carbon price, and disclose its reasons for using different prices.611 We also have\nincluded a provision, similar to the rule proposal and as recommended by some commenters,612\nstating that if the scope of entities and operations involved in the use of a described internal\ncarbon price is materially different than the organizational boundaries used for the purpose of\ncalculating a registrant\u2019s GHG emissions pursuant to the final rule, the registrant must briefly\ndescribe this difference.613\n609 See supra note 600 and accompanying text.\n610 See 17 CFR 229.1502(g)(1).\n611 See 17 CFR 229.1502(g)(2).\n612 See supra notes 592-593 and accompanying text.\n613 See 17 CFR 229.1502(g)(3).\n157\n\nWe are requiring disclosure of this information because, as commenters noted, it will\nhelp investors understand a registrant\u2019s internal carbon pricing practice and how such practice\nhas contributed to the registrant\u2019s overall evaluation and planning regarding climate-related\nrisk.614 Increased transparency about internal carbon pricing by registrants that use an internal\ncarbon price to evaluate and manage a material climate-related risk, in particular a material\ntransition risk, will help investors understand the assumptions and analyses made by registrants\nwhen determining and managing the likely financial impacts of such risks on the company.\nMoreover, including a requirement to disclose any material difference in the boundaries used for\ninternal carbon pricing and GHG emissions measurement will help minimize investor confusion\nabout the scope of entities and operations included in a registrant\u2019s application of internal carbon\npricing and improve transparency about the methodology underlying the use of internal carbon\npricing so that investors may better compare such use across registrants.615\nTo streamline the internal carbon price disclosure requirement and to reduce redundancy,\nwe have eliminated the proposed requirement to describe how a registrant uses an internal carbon\nprice to evaluate and manage climate-related risks.616 If a registrant is required to provide\ninternal carbon pricing disclosure under the final rules, the registrant is likely to describe how it\nuses an internal carbon price to evaluate and manage a material climate-related risk when\nresponding to other final rule provisions, such as when describing a related transition plan,617\neven if the description of internal carbon pricing is less detailed because it is part of a broader\nnarrative discussion. To further streamline the internal carbon price disclosure requirement, we\n614 See supra notes 590-591 and accompanying text.\n615 See, e.g., letters from ERM CVS; and PRI.\n616 See Proposing Release, section II.C.3.\n617 See 17 CFR 229.1502(e).\n158\n\nhave eliminated from the final rule the proposed requirements to disclose the rationale for\nselecting the internal carbon price applied.618\nBy streamlining the internal carbon price disclosure requirement in this way and adding\nmateriality qualifiers, the final rules will help ensure that investors receive material information\nabout the registrant\u2019s use of internal carbon pricing to inform their investment and voting\ndecisions while limiting the compliance burden for registrants. Moreover, eliminating the\nproposed requirement to provide a separate narrative description of how a registrant uses an\ninternal carbon price and the rationale for selecting the internal carbon price applied will help\naddress commenters\u2019 concerns that the proposed disclosure requirement would result in the\ndisclosure of confidential or proprietary information and act as a disincentive to using an internal\ncarbon pricing mechanism.619 We also note that, as with transition plan and scenario analysis\ndisclosure, disclosure of a registrant\u2019s use of an internal carbon price will be subject to a safe\nharbor.620 Because of these changes to the proposed rule, we believe that it is unnecessary to\nadopt an exemption or exception to the internal carbon price disclosure requirement, as some\ncommenters recommended,621 or a separate phase in for the disclosure requirement, as\nrecommended by other commenters.622\n618 See Proposing Release, section II.C.3.\n619 See supra note 596 and accompanying text.\n620 See infra section II.J.3.\n621 See supra notes 602-603 and accompanying text.\n622 See supra note 604 and accompanying text.\n159"

Proposed Rules\nThe proposed rules would have required a registrant to disclose a number of items related\nto a board of directors\u2019 oversight of climate-related risks, largely based on the TCFD framework.\nFirst, the Commission proposed to require the identification of any board members or board\ncommittees responsible for the oversight of climate-related risks,623 whether an existing\ncommittee, such as the audit committee or risk committee, or a separate committee established to\nfocus on climate-related risks. Next, the proposed rules required detailed disclosure of whether\nany member of a registrant\u2019s board of directors possessed expertise in climate-related risk.624\nAdditionally, the proposal required a description of the processes and frequency by which the\nboard or board committee discusses climate-related risks,625 including disclosure of how the\nboard is informed about climate-related risks, and how frequently the board considers such risks.\nThese proposed disclosure items were intended to afford investors with transparency into how a\nregistrant\u2019s board considers climate-related risks and any relevant qualifications of board\nmembers.626\nThe proposed rules would also have required disclosure about whether and how the board\nor board committee considered climate-related risks as part of its business strategy, risk\nmanagement, and financial oversight.627 This disclosure was intended to give investors\n623 See Proposing Release, section II.D.1.\n624 See id.\n625 See id.\n626 See id.\n627 See id.\n160\n\ninformation regarding how the board or board committee considers climate-related risks when\nreviewing and guiding business strategy and major plans of action; when setting and monitoring\nimplementation of risk management policies and performance objectives; when reviewing and\napproving annual budgets; and when overseeing major expenditures, acquisitions, and\ndivestitures. The proposed disclosure requirement sought to provide investors with information\nto assess the degree to which a board\u2019s consideration of climate-related risks has been integrated\ninto a registrant\u2019s strategic business and financial planning, and its overall level of preparation to\nmaintain its shareholder value.\nThe proposed rules also would have required disclosure about whether and how the board\nsets climate-related targets or goals and how it evaluates progress, including the establishment of\nany interim targets or goals.628 This proposed requirement was intended to help investors\nevaluate whether and how a board is preparing to mitigate or adapt to material transition risks.\nFinally, the proposed rule provided that, if applicable, a registrant may describe the board of\ndirectors\u2019 oversight of climate-related opportunities.\nWhile the goal of these governance-related proposals was to elicit decision-useful\ninformation about the board\u2019s oversight of climate-related risks for investors, the proposal\nneither required nor encouraged any particular board composition or board practices. Similarly,\nthe proposal was not intended to affect how a registrant operates, at any level, either through\nmanagement or the board of directors.\n628 See id.\n161"

One commenter stated that this aspect of the Commission\u2019s proposal\nwould help ensure that the board was receiving and processing consistent information on\nclimate-related risk.652 Others went further, asserting that directors have a fiduciary\nresponsibility to conduct increased oversight of climate-related risks, and that the proposal would\nrequire registrants to report whether and how its board was fulfilling these responsibilities.653\n648 See, e.g., letter from ICCR.\n649 See, e.g., letters from United Air Holdings, Fidelity, ICI; U.S. Chamber of Commerce; Targa Resources\nCorp; Vodafone; Business Roundtable; and SIFMA.\n650 See, e.g., letter from SIFMA.\n651 See, e.g., letter from Vodafone.\n652 See, e.g., letter from NEI.\n653 See, e.g., letter from Center for International Environmental Law (June 17, 2022) (\u201cCIEL\u201d).\n165\n\nSome commenters stated that this proposed disclosure requirement was too detailed, would\ninvite micromanagement of both the board and management, and be potentially misleading to\ninvestors.654 Commenters also stated that disclosure of when and how often boards meet on\nclimate-related matters could lead to changes in how board time and resources are allocated,\nwithout necessarily improving the quality of climate-related risk disclosure.655 Some\ncommenters pointed out that the Commission does not require registrants to report on how\nfrequently other topics are considered by the board of directors and asserted that requiring the\ndisclosure of this information with respect to climate-related risks would be out of step with\nother governance disclosure rules.656 According to these commenters, the proposed disclosure\nrequirements were so prescriptive that they singled out climate-related disclosures for\npresentation in a level of detail that was not consistent with the Commission\u2019s overall disclosure\nregime. Other commenters stated that the information was simply unnecessary and could lead to\nboilerplate disclosures.657 Some commenters cautioned that, by requiring this level of detail, the\nCommission was inadvertently discouraging companies from engaging in internal decision\nmaking that would then have to be disclosed under the proposal.658\nRegarding the proposal for disclosure on whether and how the board considers climate-\nrelated risks as part of its business strategy, risk management, and financial oversight, a number\nof commenters agreed that registrants should disclose this information as it is currently\n\u201cunnecessarily difficult\u201d for investors to assess whether there is \u201ceffective oversight of risks to\n654 See, e.g., letter from Business Roundtable.\n655 See, e.g., letters from Fidelity; and PGIM.\n656 See, e.g., letter from SIFMA.\n657 See, e.g., letter from Morningstar.\n658 See, e.g., letter from Energy Transfer.\n166\n\nfirm value, including material environmental risks.\u201d659 However, a number of commenters\nexpressed concerns with the granularity of the proposal and urged the Commission to take a less-\nprescriptive approach more consistent with the Commission\u2019s overall disclosure regime.660\nSome commenters urged the Commission to adopt a materiality qualifier to avoid eliciting\nimmaterial or overly granular information and bring the requirements more in line with other\nrequired disclosures.661\nCommenters were divided on the proposal related to disclosure of board oversight of\ntargets and goals, particularly how the board sets such targets and monitors progress.\nCommenters supportive of the proposal stated that investors need more granular governance\ndisclosures to assess whether the board has sufficient experience in managing dynamic climate-\nrelated risk.662 In contrast, other commenters asserted that the proposal would require the\nexpenditure of significant resources by registrants while offering little in the way of benefit to\ninvestors.663 Other commenters expressed the view that the proposal should focus on\nmanagement\u2019s role in setting targets and goals, given that the board\u2019s role is more appropriately\nfocused on monitoring the targets and goals that management sets.664\n659 See letter from NY City Comptroller.

    "text": "c. Final Rule\nWe are adopting the proposed requirements to disclose board oversight of climate-related\nrisks (Item 1501(a)), with some modifications to address the concerns of commenters. These\ndisclosures will enhance investors\u2019 ability to evaluate a registrant\u2019s overall management of\nclimate-related risks by improving their understanding of the board\u2019s role in overseeing those\nrisks.665 The final rule will require a description of a board of directors\u2019 oversight of climate-\nrelated risks, as proposed.666 The final rule will also require the identification, if applicable, of\nany board committee or subcommittee responsible for the oversight of climate-related risks and a\ndescription of the processes by which the board or such committee or subcommittee is informed\nabout such risks. Further, if there is a target or goal disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 229.1504 or\ntransition plan disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 229.1502(e)(1), the final rule will require disclosure of\nwhether and how the board oversees progress against the target or goal or transition plan.667\nThese disclosures are not required for registrants that do not exercise board oversight of climate-\nrelated risks.\nDespite the concerns expressed by several commenters, the proposed rules were not\nintended to shift governance behaviors, including board composition or board practices.\nSimilarly, the final rules neither seek to influence registrants\u2019 decisions about how to manage\nclimate-related risks nor does their design incorporate, reflect, or favor any governance structure\n665 See, e.g., letters from Ceres; PRI; and RMI.\n666 We are also adding Instruction 1 to Item 1501 to clarify that in the case of a foreign private issuer with a\ntwo-tier board of directors, the term \u201cboard of directors\u201d means the supervisory or non-management board.\nIn the case of a foreign private issuer meeting the requirements of 17 CFR 240.10A\u20133(c)(3), the term board\nof directors\u2019 means the issuer\u2019s board of auditors (or similar body) or statutory auditors, as applicable.\n667 The proposed governance provision stated that a registrant may also describe the board of directors\u2019\noversight of climate-related opportunities. As previously mentioned, although the final rules do not contain\na similar provision, a registrant may elect to provide such disclosure as part of its governance disclosure.\n168\n\nor process. Rather, consistent with our statutory authority, the final rules focus on disclosure of\nregistrants\u2019 existing or developing climate-related risk governance practices. We recognize that\nregistrants have varied reasons for pursuing different oversight arrangements, and some\nregistrants may reasonably determine that climate-related risks are not among the most pressing\nissue facing the company. The final rules will provide investors with the information they need\nto understand and evaluate those oversight arrangements and make informed investment\ndecisions in light of their overall investment objectives and risk tolerance. Furthermore, as stated\nabove, these disclosure requirements apply to those registrants the boards of which exercise\noversight of climate-related risks; no disclosure is required for registrants that do not have\ninformation responsive to the disclosure requirements.\nWe are not adopting some of the more prescriptive elements of the proposal in response\nto commenter concerns. Specifically, we are eliminating the proposed requirements to disclose:\n\u2022 The identity of specific board members responsible for climate-risk oversight;\n\u2022 Whether any board member has expertise in climate-related risks and the nature of the\nexpertise;\n\u2022 How frequently the board is informed of such risks; and\n\u2022 Information regarding whether and how the board sets climate-related targets or goals,\nincluding interim targets or goals.\nWhile the proposal would have required this disclosure only to the extent applicable, we\nappreciate the concerns of some commenters who stated that these elements of the proposal\ncould have unintended effects on the registrant\u2019s governance structure and processes by focusing\non one area of risk at the expense of others. In addition, some commenters raised concerns that\nthe level of detail required by the proposal would cause registrants to divulge sensitive internal\n169\n\nboard processes. It may be that a registrant, in describing \u201cthe board of directors\u2019 oversight of\nclimate-related risks,\u201d will find it necessary to disclose, or otherwise choose to disclose, some or\nall of the information called for by the proposal. But, by adopting a more streamlined rule, we\nintend to eliminate any misperception that this information is required for all registrants,\nparticularly those without existing processes or information to disclose.\nWe are, however, adopting the proposed requirement to identify any board committee or\nsubcommittee responsible for the oversight of climate-related risks, if a registrant has such a\ncommittee or subcommittee. This information is important to an understanding of how the board\nis managing such risk and will not be burdensome to disclose. Moreover, the provision simply\nrequires the registrant to identify any committee or subcommittee that has been tasked with\nmanaging climate-related risks and is not designed to influence decisions about whether and how\nthe board allocates responsibility for oversight of such risk. We are also adopting a requirement,\nalbeit modified from the proposal, to describe whether and how the board of directors oversees\nprogress against disclosed climate-related targets, goals, or transition plans. By tying this\ndisclosure requirement to circumstances in which the registrant has a disclosed climate-related\ntarget, goal, or transition plan, the final rule will avoid generating detailed disclosure about\nmatters that are not important to investors. In addition, in light of commenter concerns regarding\nthe proposed disclosure of whether and how the board of directors establishes any final or\ninterim targets or goals,668 we are omitting this requirement from the final rule. Overall, the less\nprescriptive approach to disclosure in the final rule will facilitate investors\u2019 understanding of\nhow a registrant intends to manage a target or goal that is material to its business while\n668 See supra note 663 and accompanying text.\n170\n\ndiscouraging boilerplate disclosures and avoiding any unintended adverse effects on the board\u2019s\ngovernance structures.\nWe are also adopting the proposed requirement to describe the processes by which the\nboard or any board committee or subcommittee is informed about climate-related risks, while\neliminating the requirement to describe the frequency of these discussions. While some\ncommenters stated that it would be helpful to investors for registrants to disclose both the\nprocesses and frequency of these discussions,669 other commenters expressed concern that this\ndisclosure will shift governance behavior.670 The final rules balance investors\u2019 need to\nunderstand the board\u2019s governance of climate-related risks in sufficient detail to inform an\ninvestment or voting decision with concerns that the proposal could inadvertently pressure\nregistrants to adopt specific or inflexible climate-risk governance practices or organizational\nstructures or otherwise influence the conduct of the board. By retaining the requirement to\ndisclose the process by which the board is informed, investors will have meaningful information\nthat they can use to assess the conduct of boards in dealing with climate-related risks while\navoiding overly detailed or granular disclosures that could unduly influence such processes.\nAlthough some commenters asserted that registrants may feel pressure to appoint certain\nindividuals with climate expertise,671 we reemphasize that the Commission remains agnostic\nabout whether and/or how registrants govern climate-related risks. Registrants remain free to\nelect whether and how to establish or retain the procedures and practices that they determine best\nfit their business. The focus of the final rules remains on investor protection and improving\n669 See, e.g., letters from FTLT; Morningstar; and PRI.\n670 See supra note 655.\n671 See supra note 646.\n171"

The final rules are\nfocused on disclosure and do not require, and are not formulated to prompt, registrants to change\ntheir governance or other business practices.\nWe are not, as suggested by some commenters, adopting a materiality qualifier for this\nportion of the final rule. As discussed above, we have revised the final rule from the proposal to\nmake the disclosure requirement less prescriptive. As such, registrants will have additional\nflexibility to determine how much detail to provide about the board\u2019s oversight of climate-related\nrisk. These revisions help mitigate some commenters\u2019 concerns that the rule will require\ndisclosure of immaterial information. The specific information called for by the final rule will\nprovide important context for an investor to evaluate the extent to which the board is evaluating\nclimate-related risks. If a board of directors determines to oversee a particular risk, the fact of\nsuch oversight being exercised by the board is likely material to investors given other demands\non the board\u2019s time and attention.672 Moreover, unlike management, which likely oversees many\nmore routine matters, some of which may not be material to investors, we expect that any risks\nelevated to the board level will be material to the company and limited in number. Accordingly,\nwe do not believe that a materiality qualifier is necessary for this provision.\n2. Disclosure of Management Oversight (Item 1501(b))\na.

Some commenters were concerned that\nthe disclosure of management positions or committees could reveal proprietary information\nabout the internal structure of registrants.687 On the other hand, some commenters emphasized\nthe relevance of these proposed disclosures,688 with many of these commenters explicitly tying\n684 See letter from Sullivan Cromwell (\u201cRequiring registrants to disclose governance and risk management\ninformation with more granularity inappropriately places greater emphasis on climate risk oversight\ncompared to the oversight of other business risks that are equally (and in some cases, more) deserving of\nthe attention of a registrant\u2019s board and management.\u201d).\n685 See, e.g., letter from CFA.\n686 See, e.g., letter from NRP.\n687 See, e.g., letters from AFPA; BlackRock.\n688 See, e.g., letter from PRI.\n175\n\nthis information to the need for transparency about compensation practices.689 Supportive\ncommenters also emphasized that the proposed disclosure requirements would allow investors to\nevaluate the capabilities and preparedness of a company\u2019s executive management, who are often\ntasked with incorporating climate-related risk management into business practices and\ndecisions.690 One commenter indicated that this proposal would provide different information to\ninvestors than the proposed information about boards, as it would allow investors to understand\nthe operational expertise and accountability that exists in relation to how a registrant is\noverseeing such risk.691 Commenters stated that investors are seeking particularized information\nabout management\u2019s role in dealing with climate-related risks given that effective oversight\nrequires business-level understanding of these risks.\u201d692\nSome commenters supported the proposed requirement to disclose the relevant expertise\nor identity of management position holders or members responsible for managing climate related\nrisk, stating that such disclosures would provide investors with a general understanding of how\nmanagement\u2019s climate expertise is deployed, as well as whether and how climate-related risk is\nintegrated in the organization.693 In contrast, many commenters stated that this disclosure would\nrequire registrants to publish detailed descriptions of in-house staff and management\u2019s reliance\non such staff.694 Other commenters asserted that the universe of climate-related experts is\nlimited, and that the proposed requirements would increase the competition for executives with\n689 See, e.g., letters from CFA; and Nia Impact Capital (June 15, 2022) (\u201cNia Impact\u201d).\n690 See, e.g., letter from D.

Commenters supportive of the proposal stated that the disclosure would\nallow investors to analyze how boards integrate climate-related information into the overall risk\nmanagement structure and how this information affects decision-making.704 Other commenters\nsuggested that this disclosure would drive unwelcome changes in current business practice and\nstructure, potentially diverting attention and resources away from other material risks or other\nmatters.705\nCommenters also provided views on the proposal to allow, but not require, registrants to\ndisclose the board\u2019s oversight of, and management\u2019s role in, assessing and managing climate-\nrelated opportunities.

    "text": "optional and not mandatory,706 others indicated that how companies are responding to highly\ndynamic opportunities is material information and therefore should be required to be\ndisclosed.707 One commenter stated that climate-related opportunity reporting is likely to be\nadopted in both the EU and UK, and therefore, to streamline mandatory disclosures for dually-\nlisted companies, the commenter recommended that the Commission require this disclosure,\nexcept for opportunities unrelated to a registrant\u2019s principal line of business.708\nc. Final Rule\nWe are adopting the proposed requirement to disclose management oversight of climate\nrelated risks (Item 1501(b)) with some modifications to address the concerns of commenters.\nThe final rules will, like the proposed rules, require that registrants describe management\u2019s role\nin assessing and managing climate-related risks. As commenters stated, investors need\ninformation about how management-level staff assess and manage material climate-related risks\nto make informed investment and voting decisions. However, we are limiting the disclosure\nrequired by this final rule provision to material climate-related risks, as suggested by\ncommenters,709 given the multitude of climate-related matters that may be overseen by\nmanagement. The final rules also specify that a registrant should address, as applicable, the\nfollowing non-exclusive list of disclosure items when describing management\u2019s role in assessing\nand managing the registrant\u2019s material climate-related risks:\n\u2022 Whether and which management positions or committees are responsible for assessing\nand managing climate-related risks, and the relevant expertise of such position holders or\n706 See, e.g., letter from CEMEX.\n707 See, e.g., letter from CHRE and Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development.\n708 See, e.g., letter from We Mean Business Coalition (June 13, 2022) (\u201cWe Mean Business\u201d).\n709 See, e.g., letters from MFA; and RILA.\n179\n\ncommittee members in such detail as necessary to fully describe the nature of the\nexpertise;\n\u2022 The processes by which such positions or committees assess and manage climate-related\nrisks; and\n\u2022 Whether such positions or committees report information about such risks to the board of\ndirectors or a committee or subcommittee of the board of directors.\nThe non-exclusive list of disclosures in Item 1501(b) should help elicit specific information\nabout management\u2019s oversight of climate-related risks and thereby mitigate any tendency\ntowards boilerplate disclosures. At the same time, by focusing the disclosure on management\u2019s\nrole in assessing and managing material climate-related risks, the final rules will provide\nregistrants with the flexibility to tailor the disclosures based on their particular governance\nstructure. Given these changes, we believe the final rule appropriately balances investors\u2019 needs\nfor information to understand management\u2019s involvement in assessing and managing material\nclimate risks with concerns that a more prescriptive rule could have adverse consequences on\nregistrants\u2019 governance practices or organizational structures.\nWe reiterate, as we did above with respect to our rules requiring disclosure of board\noversight of climate-related risks, that the final rule does not seek to influence decisions about\nhow to manage climate-related risks or otherwise change registrant behavior. Rather, the final\nrule seeks to elicit disclosure about existing oversight practices that will allow investors to make\nbetter informed judgments about registrants\u2019 oversight processes and mechanisms in light of\ntheir overall investment objectives and risk tolerance. Furthermore, the final rule does not\nrequire registrants that do not engage in the oversight of material climate-related risk to disclose\nany information.\n180\n\nWe are mindful of the suggestions of some commenters that we adopt additional\nrequirements to disclose information related to management oversight of climate-related risks,\nincluding descriptions of internal positions and reporting structures and detailed information\nabout climate-based remuneration. However, consistent with our overall goal to streamline the\nproposed requirements and to focus on management\u2019s oversight of material climate-related risk,\nwe are not including such additional disclosure elements in the final rule.710\nWe are adopting the proposal requiring a description of the relevant expertise of position\nholders or members responsible for assessing and managing climate-related risk.711 While we\nconsidered the view of commenters that this could cause registrants to feel compelled to find and\nhire management with such expertise, regardless of whether that is the most sensible use of\nmanagerial resources given the registrant\u2019s particular facts and circumstances, the added\nqualification that disclosure is only required where the risk is material mitigates this concern.\nWe agree with commenters that asserted that this information will be helpful to understanding a\nregistrant\u2019s ability to manage climate-related risks given the direct role that management will\nplay in overseeing any such risks yet emphasize that registrants are required to make this\ndisclosure only if they have identified a material climate risk.\nAs noted above, the final rule has been modified to eliminate many of the prescriptive\ndisclosure elements from the proposal, and it instead provides a non-exclusive list of the types of\n710 Although we are not adopting specific requirements related to executive management remuneration linked\nto climate-based incentives, to the extent a climate-related target or goal or other measure is a material\nelement of a registrant\u2019s compensation of named executive officers, such information is required to be\ndisclosed under Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K.\n711 Further, we are adding Instruction 2 to Item 1501 to clarify that relevant expertise of management in Item\n1501(b)(1) may include, for example: prior work experience in climate-related matters; any relevant\ndegrees or certifications; any knowledge, skills, or other background in climate-related matters.\n181\n\ndisclosures that a registrant should include, as applicable, when describing management\u2019s role in\nassessing and managing the registrant\u2019s material climate-related risk. For example, if applicable,\nregistrants should describe the processes by which certain positions or committees are informed\nabout and monitor climate-related risks. A process-based description of management\u2019s\ngovernance of material climate-risks can offer investors a meaningful look at how registrants\nmanage material climate-related risks. Registrants should also disclose, if applicable, whether\nmanagement reports to the board or a subcommittee of the board on climate-related risks.\nElimination of the proposed requirement to disclose how frequently the board meets to discuss\nclimate-related matters, as discussed above, addresses commenters\u2019 concerns that this disclosure,\nif provided, could divert limited resources from the consideration of other material risks and\nencourage changes to business practices. Nonetheless, information on whether management\nreports to the board can provide needed clarity on the connection between board and\nmanagement level governance of climate-related risks, and accordingly, we have retained it as an\nexample of the type of disclosure that might be responsive to the rule. We have also added a\nreference to a subcommittee of the board because some registrants may establish a subcommittee\nto focus on climate-related issues.\nFinally, as noted above,712 we are not adopting the proposed rule that would have\nallowed, but did not require, registrants to describe management\u2019s role in assessing and\nmanaging climate-related opportunities. As with other voluntary disclosure, registrants may\nelect to include such disclosure. While we recognize that some commenters recommended that\nsuch disclosure be mandatory, we have determined to treat the disclosure regarding climate-\n712 See section II.C.1.c.\n182\n\nrelated opportunities as optional, among other reasons, to allay any anti-competitive concerns\nthat might arise from a requirement to disclose a particular business opportunity.713\nThese changes will also help address the concerns expressed by some commenters,\nincluding from smaller reporting companies and registrants in certain industries,714 that the\nproposed rules would unduly pressure such registrants into a one-sized-fits-all governance\napproach given the line of business, size, and structure of their companies.715 While we disagree\nwith one commenter\u2019s suggestion that the proposal would \u201cmandate that every company in the\nUnited States be required to expand management structures in order to accommodate concerns\nthat are not material to a company,\u201d716 shifting to a non-exclusive list of topics that a registrant\nshould address, as applicable, will mitigate the concerns raised by some commenters that the\nprescriptiveness of the proposed disclosures could lead to such a result. In addition, the\nflexibility afforded to registrants under the final rule to determine which details about\nmanagement\u2019s oversight of climate-related risks to include in their disclosure will help alleviate\nconcerns that the proposal would elevate climate-related disclosures above other, equally\nimportant, disclosures. Furthermore, as stated above, the final rule does not impose any\ndisclosure requirements on registrants that do not exercise management oversight of climate-\nrelated risks.\n713 See Proposing Release, section II.A.1.\n714 See, e.g., letter from BIO.\n715 See, e.g., letter from Chamber (\u201cWe believe the Proposed Rule, if adopted, would create a board oversight\nand risk management structure that not only makes little sense for certain companies but could harm\ninvestors in companies that have no need for such extensive oversight of climate risk. The Proposed Rule,\nif adopted, would present a costly distraction for companies with limited resources (particularly small-cap\nand many mid-cap companies) to attempt to align their behavior and disclosures with those of other\ncompanies that similarly felt pressured by the rule to adapt their behavior to what appears to be the SEC\u2019s\npreferred response to climate-related risks.\u201d).\n716 See letter from BIO.\n183"

Proposed Rule\nThe Commission proposed to require a registrant to describe any processes the registrant\nhas for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks.717 The Commission stated\nthat more granular information regarding climate-related risk management could allow investors\nto better understand how a registrant identifies, evaluates, and addresses climate-related risks that\nmay materially impact its business.718 Such information could also permit investors to ascertain\nwhether a registrant has integrated the assessment of climate-related risks into its regular risk\nmanagement processes.719\nThe rule proposal would have required a registrant, when describing the processes for\nidentifying and assessing climate-related risks, to disclose, as applicable, how the registrant:\n\u2022 Determines the relative significance of climate-related risks compared to other risks;\n\u2022 Considers existing or likely regulatory requirements of policies, such as GHG emissions\nlimits, when identifying climate-related risks;\n\u2022 Considers shifts in customer or counterparty preferences, technological changes, or\nchanges in market prices in assessing potential transition risks; and\n717 See Proposing Release, section II.E.1. As previously noted, see supra note 464, the Commission proposed\nto require transition plan disclosure in connection with a registrant\u2019s risk management discussion.

The final rule includes transition plan disclosure as part of a registrant\u2019s\ndisclosure about climate-related risks and their impact on the registrant\u2019s strategy.

Comments\nMany commenters supported the proposed rule requiring registrants to describe any\nprocesses in place for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks.725 Commenters\nstated that investors would use the risk management disclosures to evaluate an issuer\u2019s readiness\nfor confronting climate-related risks.726 Commenters also stated that the proposed risk\nmanagement disclosure requirement would improve the quality of the disclosures that registrants\ncurrently provide on a voluntary basis.727 Commenters further stated that the proposed risk\nmanagement disclosure requirement is aligned with the TCFD\u2019s recommended disclosures\nregarding risk management, with which many registrants are already familiar.728\nOther commenters generally opposed the proposed risk management disclosure\nrequirement.729 Commenters objected to the prescriptiveness of the proposal, which they stated\nwould result in overly granular disclosure that may not be relevant to a registrant\u2019s particular\nbusiness or industry and, therefore, may not be material for investors.730 Commenters also stated\nthat the prescriptive nature of the rule proposal may result in the disclosure of commercially\n725 See, e.g., letters from AGs of Cal. et al.; Amer. for Fin.

Progress; C2ES; and US SIF. We note that other commenters that\napproved of the proposed risk management disclosure requirements also supported aligning the\nCommission\u2019s climate disclosure requirements generally with the TCFD recommendations because it\nwould help elicit consistent, comparable, and reliable disclosure for investors.

See also supra note 728.\n738 See letter from PRI (stating that the determination of how a company determines the importance of climate-\nrelated risks \u201cwill then go on to dictate how management and the board consider climate-related risks as\npart of governance, [and] whether management sets climate related targets or uses other tools such as\nscenario analysis\u201d).\n739 See letter from Calvert.\n740 See letter from WSP.\n741 See, e.g., letters from ICI; PRI; and TotalEnergies.\n742 See, e.g., letter from WSP.\n743 See, e.g., letter from ICI.\n188\n\nor changes in market prices in assessing potential transition risks.744 Certain commenters, while\nsupportive of the proposal, stated that the Commission should go further and also afford\nregistrants the ability to provide additional disclosures, such as regarding how climate-related\ntechnological and customer shifts are being managed, minimized, tracked over time, and\nreported on regularly.745\nMany commenters supported the proposal to require a registrant to disclose how it\ndecides whether to mitigate, accept, or adapt to a particular climate-related risk.746 One of these\ncommenters stated that this information would help investors evaluate whether a company has\nimplemented adequate processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related\nrisks.747 Many commenters similarly supported the Commission\u2019s proposal to require disclosure\nof how registrants prioritize climate-related risks and how they determine to mitigate a high\npriority risk.748 Commenters indicated that information concerning how the registrant prioritizes\nclimate-related risks vis-\u00e0-vis other risks that the registrant is managing would be particularly\nuseful.749 One commenter stated that disclosure of a registrant\u2019s rationale for pursuing capital\nexpenditures for managing certain climate-related risks would be beneficial for investors to\nbetter assess the company\u2019s capital allocation.750 Other commenters emphasized that since\ninvestors must depend on issuers\u2019 assessment of their own significant or material climate-related\n744 See, e.g., letters from C2ES; ICI; PRI; TotalEnergies; and WSP.\n745 See, e.g., letter from C2ES.\n746 See, e.g., letters from CalPERS; C2ES; ICI; PRI; Morningstar; TotalEnergies; and WSP.\n747 See letter from ICI.\n748 See, e.g., letters from ICI; Morningstar; TotalEnergies; and WSP.\n749 See, e.g., letters from C2ES; and WSP.\n750 See letter from CalPERS.\n189\n\nrisks, the proposed disclosure requirements would allow investors to understand how issuers\nreach these conclusions.751\nMany commenters also supported the proposed disclosure requirement concerning\nwhether and how climate-related risk management processes are integrated into a registrant\u2019s\noverall risk management system.752 One commenter stated that information about how a\nregistrant integrates its climate risk management processes into its overall risk management\nsystem is essential to understanding the effectiveness of those climate risk management\nprocesses.753 Another commenter stated that disclosure regarding how a registrant\u2019s identified\nmaterial climate-related risks are \u201cintegrated into its company-wide enterprise risk management\nframework [would] allow for comparability of climate risks with other financial and non-\nfinancial risks.\u201d754 Yet another commenter stated that information about whether a registrant has\ncentralized its climate-related risk management into its regular risk management processes is\ndecision-useful for investors because the disintegration of climate-related risks from other risks\nsignals insufficient competence in managing the financial implications of climate-related\nmatters.755 One commenter expressed support for the proposed risk management disclosure\nprovision but cautioned that registrants should not be required to speculate about future\n751 See, e.g., letters from Earthjustice (June 17, 2022); and RMI.\n752 See, e.g., letters from Anthesis; Eni SpA; ICI; Morningstar; NY St. Comptroller; PRI; Verena Rossolatos\n(June 8, 2022) (\u201cV.

Rossolatos.\n190\n\nrestructurings, write-downs, or impairments related to climate risks or disclose any trade secrets\nor confidential business information in their climate-related risk management disclosures.756\nSeveral commenters opposed the proposed risk management disclosure requirement\nbecause of the detailed items that a registrant would be required to address when describing the\nprocesses used to identify, assess, and manage climate-related risks and how those processes are\nintegrated into the registrant\u2019s overall risk management system.757 One commenter stated that\nthe proposed disclosure requirement could cause investors to overestimate climate-related risks\nand improperly contextualize the materiality of those risks.758 Another commenter stated that the\nproposed disclosure requirement was redundant because such information already must be\nincluded in annual reports.759 Other commenters expressed concern that the proposed disclosure\nrequirement called for unnecessarily detailed, confidential, and proprietary information.760 Some\ncommenters also asserted that the proposed itemized risk management disclosure requirements\ngo well beyond the TCFD framework, which one commenter stated would \u201cnot provide a\nmaterial benefit to investors and in fact may harm the public markets by creating undue costs on\nissuers to produce such information.\u201d761 Other commenters criticized the proposed risk\nmanagement disclosure provision for not including materiality qualifiers and not being more\n756 See letter from BOA.\n757 See, e.g., letters from Chamber; International Energy Credit Association (June 17, 2022) (\u201cIECA\u201d); MFA;\nSoc.

    "text": "principles-based, and cautioned that the prescriptiveness of the rule proposal would lead to\nboilerplate language that would not provide decision-useful information to investors.762\n3. Final Rule\nAfter considering the comments received, we are adopting a requirement (Item 1503),\nmodified from the proposal as discussed below, to describe any processes the registrant has for\nidentifying, assessing, and managing material climate-related risks.763 We agree with those\ncommenters that stated investors need more comprehensive disclosure of registrants\u2019 climate-\nrelated risk management practices to inform their investment and voting decisions.764 Because\nclimate-related risks can have material impacts on a registrant\u2019s business, it is important for\ninvestors to have information available to them so that they can understand how a registrant\nidentifies, assesses, and manages any such risks. At the same time, we are mindful of\ncommenters\u2019 suggestions, both for this risk management disclosure in particular and climate-\nrelated disclosures more generally, that the Commission promulgate rules that allow registrants\nto tailor the disclosure of material climate-related risks and related management practices to their\nown particular facts and circumstances.765 Accordingly, we are adopting a less prescriptive\napproach that focuses on a description of processes for identifying, assessing, and managing\nmaterial climate-related risks. In doing so, we have sought to avoid imposing a \u201cone-size-fits-\nall\u201d disclosure model766 that fails to account for differences in industries and businesses and that\n762 See, e.g., letters from Chamber; IECA; and J. Weinstein.\n763 See 17 CFR 229.1503(a). As noted in section II.D.2.c above, we have moved the disclosure requirement\nconcerning a registrant\u2019s transition plan to the 17 CFR 229.1502.\n764 See, e.g., letters from Ceres; C2ES; PWHC; SKY Harbor; and WSP.\n765 See supra note 730 and accompanying text.\n766 See, e.g., letters from API; Chamber; and SIFMA.\n192\n\ncould result in disclosure of immaterial information while still eliciting decision-useful\ninformation for investors about registrants\u2019 risk management practices.\nAs a number of commenters indicated, consistent information about a registrant\u2019s\nmanagement of climate-related risks is vital to informed investment and voting decisions.767\nDespite the importance of climate-related risk management information to investors, only a\nminority of registrants currently include such information in their voluntary climate reports or in\ntheir Exchange Act filings.768 We considered comments that the proposed disclosure\nrequirements are redundant because existing rules already require disclosure about material risks\nin annual reports, but we continue to believe that a specific disclosure item focused on managing\nmaterial climate-related risks is warranted. While registrants may be required to disclose certain\nclimate-related information in filings made with the Commission pursuant to existing disclosure\nrequirements, as noted above769 there is a need to improve the consistency, comparability, and\nreliability of disclosures about climate-related risk management for investors given that, as noted\nabove, most registrants are not currently including the type of information called for by the final\nrules in voluntary climate reports or Exchange Act filings.770 We also considered comments that\nthe proposal placed undue emphasis on climate-related risks and, as discussed below, have made\na number of changes in response to streamline the requirements and focus on material climate-\nrelated risks.\n767 See supra note 727 and accompanying text. See also Anthesis (stating that the SEC should require the\nregistrant to disclose its process for identifying climate risks with the highest materiality and explain its\nadaptation/mitigation plan to build resiliency).\n768 See TCFD, 2022 Status Report (Oct. 2022), available at\nhttps://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/60/2022/10/2022-TCFD-Status-Report.pdf (indicating that only\napproximately one-third of over 1,400 public companies surveyed provided disclosure concerning climate\nrisk management processes in their 2021 reports).\n769 See supra note 727 and accompanying text.\n770 See section IV.A.5.\n193\n\nFirst, in a change from the proposal, we have added a materiality qualifier to the\ndisclosure item.771 The final rule will require registrants to disclose any existing processes for\nthe identification, assessment, and management of material climate-related risks. Including a\nmateriality qualifier addresses the specific concerns expressed by commenters that the proposal\nwould require registrants to disclose this information in a level of detail that would impose undue\ncosts. If a registrant has not identified a material climate-related risk, no disclosure is required.\nGiven the concerns expressed by commenters that there is a wide range of risks that registrants\nmanage as part of their operations, we are persuaded that it is appropriate to include a materiality\nqualifier for this aspect of the proposal to help ensure that the final rule elicits decision-useful\ninformation for investors without imposing an undue burden on registrants and placing undue\nemphasis on climate-related risks that are not material.\nSimilarly, to address the concerns of commenters that the proposed risk management\ndisclosure provision would require registrants to address items that might not be relevant to their\nparticular business or industry,772 we have removed several prescriptive elements from the final\nrule. Those proposed provisions that we are not adopting would have required a registrant, when\ndescribing any processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks, to disclose, as\napplicable, how the registrant:\n\u2022 Determines the relative significance of climate-related risks compared to other risks;\n\u2022 Considers existing or likely regulatory requirements or policies, such as GHG emissions\nlimits, when identifying climate-related risks;\n771 See supra note 730 and accompanying text.\n772 See supra note 730 and accompanying text.\n194\n\n\u2022 Considers shifts in customer or counterparty preferences, technological changes, or\nchanges in market prices in assessing potential transition risks; and\n\u2022 Determines the materiality of climate-related risks.\nInstead, the final rule will allow a registrant, when describing its processes for identifying,\nassessing, and managing material climate-related risks, to determine which factors are most\nsignificant, and therefore should be addressed, based on its particular facts and circumstances,\nwhich may include information on the items listed above.\nCommenters that supported the proposal stated that a meaningful description of the\nprocesses underlying climate risk management is necessary to enable investors to evaluate\nregistrants\u2019 climate risk management practices as part of their investment decisions. The final\nrule will elicit disclosures that offer a more complete picture of the management of material\nclimate-related risks while also mitigating concerns that the proposed rule could unnecessarily\nelevate climate-related risk above other important matters and give rise to competitive harm and\nincreased litigation risk for registrants. The final rule will also promote more consistent and\ncomparable disclosure of registrants\u2019 climate-related risk management practices than is currently\navailable from voluntary reporting and, as these provisions of the final rules more closely align\nwith the TCFD, they may limit costs for those registrants who are familiar with reporting under\nthis framework.\nThe final rule provides that a registrant should address, as applicable, how it identifies\nwhether it has incurred or is reasonably likely to incur a material physical or transition risk.773\nThis provision is similar to the proposed rule that would have required a registrant to describe its\n773 See 17 CFR 229.1503(a)(1).\n195\n\nprocesses for identifying a climate-related risk.774 The final rule substitutes the more specific\nterms \u201cphysical risk or transition risk\u201d for \u201cclimate-related risk\u201d to clarify and simplify the\nrequirement since Item 1500 defines climate-related risk to encompass physical and transition\nrisks. In addition, because the processes and factors that a registrant may use to identify the two\ntypes of risks may differ in certain respects, or in some cases a registrant may face one and not\nthe other kind of risk, this change should elicit more relevant information for investors.775\nSimilar to the rule proposal, the final rule also provides that a registrant should address,\nas applicable, how it:\n\u2022 Decides whether to mitigate, accept, or adapt to the particular risk;776 and\n\u2022 Prioritizes whether to address the climate-related risk.777\nThe final rules will help investors to understand the processes that a registrant has for\nidentifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks, consistent with the feedback of many\ncommenters.778 In this regard, commenters further indicated that information concerning how a\nregistrant prioritizes climate-related risks vis-\u00e0-vis other risks that the registrant is managing\nwould be particularly useful.779 We are not, however, retaining the proposed requirement to\ndisclose how a registrant determines how to mitigate any high priority risks. In response to the\nconcerns expressed by several commenters,780 we have removed this proposed disclosure item to\n774 See Proposing Release, section II.E.1.\n775 See TCFD, supra note 332, at 13-14 (providing different tables (Tables D2 and D3) outlining the\nidentification and assessment approaches for transition risks and physical risks).\n776 See 17 CFR 229.1503(a)(2).\n777 See 17 CFR 229.1503(a)(3).\n778 See supra note 747 and accompanying text.\n779 See supra note 749 and accompanying text.\n780 See supra note 733 and 734 and accompanying text.\n196\n\nreduce the prescriptiveness of the risk management disclosure requirement and streamline this\nrequirement, as we have done with other areas of the final rules. Furthermore, in response to one\ncommenter who supported the proposal but cautioned against an overly broad application,781 we\nconfirm that the final rules do not require registrants to speculate in their disclosures about future\nrestructurings, write-downs, or impairments related to climate risk management. The flexibility\nafforded by the final rules also helps address the point made by the same commenter that the\nproposed disclosure item should not compel registrants to disclose trade secrets or confidential\nbusiness information.\nAlso similar to the rule proposal, the final rule provides that, if a registrant is managing a\nmaterial climate-related risk, it must disclose whether and how any of the processes it has\ndescribed for identifying, assessing, and managing the material climate-related risk have been\nintegrated into the registrant\u2019s overall risk management system or processes.782 As some\ncommenters noted, information about how a registrant integrates its climate risk management\nprocesses into its overall risk management system is important to help investors understand and\nassess the effectiveness of those climate risk management processes.783 Mandating this\ndisclosure, therefore, will allow investors to make better informed decisions about the overall\nrisk profile of their investment in the registrant and provide a measure from which they can\nevaluate similarly situated companies.784\nWe are not adopting the proposed requirement for a registrant to disclose, if it has a\nseparate board or management committee responsible for assessing and managing climate-\n781 See e.g., letter from BOA.\n782 See 17 CFR 229.1503(b).\n783 See supra note 753 and accompanying text.\n784 See, e.g., letter from SKY Harbor.\n197\n\nrelated risks, how that committee interacts with the registrant\u2019s board or management committee\ngoverning risks. Several commenters stated that they do not have dedicated board or\nmanagement committees for managing climate-related risks,785 or asserted that including such\nprescriptive elements in the final rule could lead to boilerplate disclosure.786 Having considered\nthese comments, and in light of our overall aim to reduce the prescriptiveness of the proposed\nrequirements, we are not including this disclosure item in the final rule. We believe the other\ndisclosure items we are adopting will still provide investors with decision-useful information\nabout how registrants manage their material climate-related risks.\nFinally, as noted above,787 we are not adopting the proposed rule that allowed but did not\nrequire registrants to describe any processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-\nrelated opportunities when responding to any of the provisions in the risk management\nsection.788 As with other voluntary disclosure, registrants may elect to include such disclosure.\nWhile we recognize the recommendation of some commenters that such disclosure be\nmandatory, consistent with the rule proposal, we have determined to treat disclosure regarding\nclimate-related opportunities as optional, among other reasons, to allay any anti-competitive\nconcerns that might arise from a requirement to disclose a particular business opportunity.789\n785 See, e.g., letter from BIO.\n786 See, e.g., letter from Chamber.\n787 See supra section II.C.1.c.\n788 See 17 CFR 229.1503(c).\n789 See Proposing Release, section II.A.1.\n198"

    "text": "G. Targets and Goals Disclosure (Item 1504)\n1. Proposed Rule\nThe Commission proposed to require a registrant that has set any climate-related targets\nor goals to disclose certain information about those targets or goals.790 The proposed rule\nprovided examples of climate-related targets or goals, such as those related to the reduction of\nGHG emissions or regarding energy usage, water usage, conservation or ecosystem restoration,\nor revenues from low-carbon products in line with anticipated regulatory requirements, market\nconstraints, or other goals established by a climate-related treaty, law, regulation, policy, or\norganization.791\nThe proposed rule would have required a registrant that has set climate-related targets or\ngoals to disclose the targets or goals and include, as applicable, a description of:\n\u2022 The scope of activities and emissions included in the target;\n\u2022 The unit of measurement, including whether the target is absolute or intensity based;\n\u2022 The defined time horizon by which the target is intended to be achieved, and whether the\ntime horizon is consistent with one or more goals established by a climate-related treaty,\nlaw, regulation, policy, or organization;\n\u2022 The defined baseline time period and baseline emissions against which progress will be\ntracked with a consistent base year set for multiple targets;\n\u2022 Any interim targets set by the registrant; and\n790 See Proposing Release, section II.I.\n791 See id.\n199\n\n\u2022 How the registrant intends to meet its climate-related targets or goals.792\nThe proposed rule also would have required a registrant to disclose relevant data to\nindicate whether it is making progress toward achieving the target or goal and how such progress\nhas been achieved. The proposed rule would have required the registrant to update this\ndisclosure each fiscal year by describing the actions taken during the year to achieve its targets or\ngoals.793\nFinally, the Commission proposed to require a registrant that, as part of any net emissions\nreduction strategy, uses carbon offsets794 or RECs795 to disclose the role that carbon offsets or\nRECs play in the registrant\u2019s climate-related business strategy.796 If the registrant used carbon\noffsets or RECs in its plan to achieve climate-related targets or goals,797 the proposed rule would\n792 See id. The proposed rule further provided, as an example, that for a target or goal regarding net GHG\nemissions reduction, the discussion could include a strategy to increase energy efficiency, transition to\nlower carbon products, purchase carbon offsets or RECs, or engage in carbon removal and carbon storage.\n793 See id.\n794 The proposed rules defined carbon offsets as representing an emissions reduction or removal of greenhouse\ngases in a manner calculated and traced for the purpose of offsetting an entity\u2019s GHG emissions. See\nProposing Release, section II.C.2.\n795 The proposed rules defined an REC, consistent with the EPA\u2019s commonly used definition, to mean a credit\nor certificate representing each purchased megawatt-hour (1 MWh or 1000 kilowatt-hours) of renewable\nelectricity generated and delivered to a registrant\u2019s power grid. See id.\n796 See id. The Commission proposed the requirement to disclose information about the carbon offsets or\nRECs used by a registrant both in the proposed disclosure requirements for targets and goals and as part of\nthe proposed disclosure requirements regarding the impacts of climate-related risks on a registrant\u2019s\nstrategy. See Proposing Release, sections II.C.2 and II.I. To streamline and reduce redundancies in the\nsubpart 1500 disclosure requirements, the final rules require disclosure of used carbon offsets or RECs only\nas part of the targets and goals disclosure requirements. Nevertheless, as discussed below, a registrant may\nelect to provide its disclosure about targets and goals as part of its strategy discussion, including its\ntransition plan disclosure, as applicable. The final rules also require certain disclosures of offsets and\nRECs under the Regulation S-X amendments. See 17 CFR 210.14-02(e)(1) and infra section II.K.3.c.vi.\n797 While both carbon offsets and RECs represent commonly used GHG emissions mitigation options for\ncompanies, they are used for somewhat different purposes. A company may purchase carbon offsets to\naddress its GHG emissions (Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions) by verifying global emissions reductions at\nadditional, external projects. The reduction in GHG emissions from one place (\u201coffset project\u201d) can be\nused to \u201coffset\u201d the emissions taking place somewhere else (at the company\u2019s operations). See, e.g., EPA,\nOffsets and RECs: What's the Difference? (Feb. 2018), available at\n200"

Comments\na. The Overall Proposed Disclosure Requirements\nMany commenters supported the rule proposal requiring a registrant that has set climate-\nrelated targets or goals, including the reduction of GHG emissions, to disclose certain\ninformation about those targets or goals.800 Commenters stated that information about a\nregistrant\u2019s set targets and goals, how a registrant plans to achieve them, and progress made\ntowards them is critical to understanding a registrant\u2019s transition risk management and its\nexposure to the likely financial impacts of identified transition risks.801 Commenters also stated\nhttps://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2018-03/documents/gpp_guide_recs_offsets.pdf. In contrast, a\ncompany may purchase an REC in renewable electricity markets solely to address its indirect GHG\nemissions associated with purchased electricity (i.e., Scope 2 emissions) by verifying the use of zero- or\nlow-emissions renewable sources of electricity.\n798 See Proposing Release, section II.I.\n799 See id.\n800 See, e.g., letters from AllianceBernstein; Amazon; Amer. for Fin.

Final Rule\na. The Overall Disclosure Requirement (Item 1504(a), (b), and (c))\nThe final rule (Item 1504(a)) will require a registrant to disclose any climate-related\ntarget or goal if such target or goal has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially\naffect the registrant\u2019s business, results of operations, or financial condition.847 Investors need\ndetailed information about a registrant\u2019s climate-related targets or goals in order to understand\nand assess the registrant\u2019s transition risk strategy and how the registrant is managing the material\nimpacts of its identified climate-related risks. We recognize, however, as some commenters\nindicated, that an overly broad requirement to disclose any climate-related target or goal, even\none that is meant for preliminary, internal planning purposes and that is not yet material, could\nimpose a compliance burden on registrants that may outweigh its benefit to investors.848\nConditioning the targets and goals disclosure requirement on the targets or goals being material\nwill help to address this concern by focusing the requirement on the information that is most\nlikely to be decision-useful for investors.\nIf a registrant sets an internal target or goal that materially affects or is reasonably likely\nto materially affect the registrant\u2019s business, results of operations, or financial condition (e.g.,\ndue to material expenditures or operational changes that are required to achieve the target or\ngoal), then investors should have access to information about that target or goal to help them\n846 See letter from CEMEX.\n847 See 17 CFR 229.1504(a).\n848 See supra notes 823 and 828 and accompanying text.\n210\n\nunderstand the financial impacts and assess the registrant\u2019s transition risk management. While\nsome commenters recommended that the Commission require the disclosure only of targets or\ngoals that are both material and publicly announced,849 we decline to follow this suggestion.\nSuch a condition would enable a registrant to keep non-public an internal target or goal that is\nmaterial, which would fail to protect investors by potentially precluding their access to\ninformation that is important to make informed investment and voting decisions. We\nreemphasize, however, that a registrant is not required to disclose an internal target or goal that is\nnot material.\nIn addition, we decline to follow the recommendation of some commenters that the\ntargets and goals disclosure requirement should only be triggered by the board\u2019s or CEO\u2019s\nformal adoption of the target or goal.850 Such a provision would deprive investors of material\ninformation for procedural reasons unrelated to the importance of the information to investors.\nFurthermore, as previously mentioned, the final rules are intended to elicit material climate-\nrelated disclosures for investors and not to influence governance practices regarding climate-\nrelated matters. Because registrants may have different processes for setting targets or goals, we\nbelieve that materiality is a better threshold for disclosure of targets or goals than basing the\ndisclosure requirement on an internal process that may differ from company to company.\nSimilarly, although one commenter recommended that the Commission require the\ndisclosure only of targets or goals related to a registrant\u2019s GHG emissions,851 we decline to\nfollow this recommendation. Investors need information about all of a registrant\u2019s material\n849 See supra note 829 and accompanying text.\n850 See supra note 820 and accompanying text.\n851 See supra note 807 and accompanying text.\n211\n\nclimate-related targets and goals in order to assess the impact of such targets and goals on a\nregistrant\u2019s overall business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. Although\nthe particular non-GHG emissions target or goal to be disclosed will depend on a registrant\u2019s\nparticular facts and circumstances, to the extent such targets or goals are material, a registrant\nmust disclose them. To simplify the targets and goals disclosure requirement and avoid implying\nany topical focus regarding the particular targets or goals that should be discussed, we have\neliminated from the final rule the parenthetical \u201ce.g., the reduction of GHG emissions or\nregarding energy usage, water usage, or revenues from low-carbon products.\u201d\nWe also decline to follow the recommendations of some commenters to include\nprovisions that specifically require the disclosure of targets or goals related to mitigation of\nimpacts on local communities or that concern human capital management goals.852 The final\nrule is intended to elicit disclosure of any climate-related target or goal that has materially\naffected or is reasonably likely to materially affect a registrant\u2019s business, results of operations,\nor financial condition. Accordingly, any target or goal meeting the conditions of the final rule\n(including that it is material) will need to be disclosed regardless of the particular issues it\naddresses, if that target or goal is considered climate-related in the registrant\u2019s particular\ncircumstances and if achieving such target or goal would materially impact its business, results\nof operations, or financial condition. We note that a registrant may voluntarily disclose\nadditional information that is not required to be disclosed under the final rule (and not part of a\ntarget or goal) but that is related to the mitigation of climate-related risks.\nSimilar to the proposed rule, with some modifications as discussed below, the final rule\n(Item 1504(b)) will require a registrant that is disclosing its targets and goals pursuant to Item\n852 See supra note 806 and accompanying text.\n212\n\n1504 to provide any additional information or explanation necessary to an understanding of the\nmaterial impact or reasonably likely material impact of the target or goal, including, as\napplicable, a description of:\n\u2022 The scope of activities included in the target;\n\u2022 The unit of measurement;\n\u2022 The defined time horizon by which the target is intended to be achieved, and whether the\ntime horizon is based on one or more goals established by a climate-related treaty, law,\nregulation, policy, or organization;\n\u2022 If the registrant has established a baseline for the target or goal, the defined baseline time\nperiod and the means by which progress will be tracked; and\n\u2022 A qualitative description of how the registrant intends to meet its climate-related targets\nor goals.853\nThese disclosures will allow investors to better understand a registrant\u2019s targets or goals\nand how it intends to achieve them, which will help investors better assess a registrant\u2019s\ntransition risks and make more informed investment and voting decisions. In order to address\nthe concern of some commenters that the proposed targets and goals disclosure provision was too\nprescriptive and would impose a costly compliance burden without necessarily resulting in\nmaterial information,854 the final rule has been revised so that the listed items are non-exclusive\nexamples of additional information or explanation that a registrant must disclose only if\n853 See 17 CFR 229.1504(b).\n854 See supra note 823 and accompanying text.\n213\n\nnecessary to an understanding of the material impact or reasonably likely material impact of the\ntarget or goal.855\nTo further streamline the targets and goals disclosure requirement, the final rules do not\ninclude \u201cemissions\u201d in the list of information that must be disclosed if necessary to an\nunderstanding of the material impact or reasonably likely material impact of a target or goal. If a\nregistrant has set a material target or goal to reduce emissions, it will be required to disclose this\nwhen explaining the scope of activities included in the target. We also have eliminated the\nproposed disclosure item regarding whether a target is absolute or intensity-based because this\ninformation will likely be elicited by other required disclosure, such as the unit of measurement\npertaining to the target or goal.856\nSimilar to the proposed rule, the final rule requires disclosure, as applicable, of how the\nregistrant intends to meet its climate-related targets or goals.857 However, in order to help\naddress the concern of some commenters that the proposed rule could result in the disclosure of\nan excessive amount of detail, the final rule specifies that this discussion of prospective activities\nneed only be qualitative. In addition, we are eliminating the proposed example that, for a target\nor goal regarding net GHG emissions reduction, the discussion could include a strategy to\nincrease energy efficiency, transition to lower carbon products, purchase carbon offsets or RECs,\nor engage in carbon removal and carbon storage.858 This will avoid any misperception that these\nare required items of disclosure. The final rule leaves it up to the registrant to determine what\n855 See 17 CFR 229.1504(b).\n856 In addition, as discussed below in section II.H, elimination of this proposed disclosure requirement is\nconsistent with our removal of the proposed requirement to disclose a registrant\u2019s GHG emissions metrics\nin intensity terms in addition to absolute terms.\n857 See 17 CFR 229.1504(b)(5).\n858 See Proposing Release, section II.I.\n214\n\nspecific factors to highlight as part of the qualitative description of how it plans to meet its\ntargets or goals.\nWe are also not adopting the proposed requirement to disclose any interim targets set by\nthe registrant. We agree with commenters that stated that this disclosure item is not necessary\nbecause, if a registrant has set an interim target that is material, it will likely be included in the\nregistrant\u2019s discussion of its plan to achieve its targets or goals.859\nSimilar to the proposed rule, the final rule (Item 1504(c)) will require a registrant to\ndisclose any progress toward meeting the target or goal and how such progress has been\nachieved.860 Also similar to the proposed rule, the final rule will require the registrant to update\nthis disclosure each fiscal year by describing the actions taken during the year to achieve its\ntargets or goals.861 We are adopting this updating requirement for substantially the same reasons\nwe are adopting the updating requirement with respect to the transition plan disclosure required\nunder Item 1502(e),862 including because it will better enable investors to monitor impacts on the\nregistrant as it attempts to meet its targets or goals.\nRelatedly, the final rule will require a registrant to include in its targets and goals\ndisclosure a discussion of any material impacts to the registrant\u2019s business, results of operations,\nor financial condition as a direct result of the target or goal or the actions taken to make progress\ntoward meeting the target or goal.863 This discussion must include quantitative and qualitative\n859 See letter from Unilever.\n860 See 17 CFR 229.1504(c).\n861 See id.\n862 See supra notes 508-514 and accompanying text. In addition, as with the required transition plan\ndisclosure, no update about targets and goals would be required to be disclosed if the underlying targets or\ngoals are not required to be disclosed (e.g., because the target or goal is no longer material).\n863 See 17 CFR 229.1504(c)(1).\n215\n\ndisclosure of any material expenditures and material impacts on financial estimates and\nassumptions as a direct result of the target or goal or the actions taken to make progress toward\nmeeting the target or goal,864 consistent with the suggestion of some commenters.865 We have\nadded these latter provisions because, as commenters noted, a company\u2019s climate commitments,\nand progress in relation to its commitments, may materially impact its business, outlook,\noperating expenditures, capital expenditures, liquidity, and other capital resources, which is why\ninvestors seek and need information about such material expenditures and other material\nfinancial impacts related to its targets and goals.866 As discussed in more detail below,867 a\nnumber of commenters who supported the proposed expenditures disclosures in Regulation S-X\nindicated that such disclosure would help investors understand a registrant\u2019s ability to meet its\nclimate-related targets and goals.868\nWe recognize commenters\u2019 concerns about registrants\u2019 abilities to identify, attribute, and\nquantify the impact of transition activities in the financial statements.869 We believe that\nproviding for this disclosure in the context of Item 1504 information on progress towards targets\nor goals appropriately balances investors\u2019 need for this information with commenters\u2019 concerns\nabout implementation challenges. As discussed above,870 with respect to concerns raised in the\n864 See 17 CFR 229.1504(c)(2).\n865 See supra notes 816 and 817 and accompanying text.\n866 See, e.g., letters from Amazon; Amer. for Fin.

To the extent that there is any overlapping disclosure of material expenditures\n216\n\ncontext of the proposed Regulation S-X amendments about registrants\u2019 abilities to disaggregate\nthe portion of an expenditure that is directly related to transition activities, under the final rules,\nregistrants will have flexibility to explain qualitatively the nature of any disclosed expenditure\nand how it is a direct result of progress under a disclosed target or goal. In addition, subjecting\nthe disclosure requirement to materiality rather than a bright-line threshold, as was proposed for\nthe Regulation S-X amendments, will help reduce the compliance burden of the final rules while\nproviding material information for investors. Additionally, when considering which\nexpenditures related to progress under a disclosed target or goal are material over the relevant\nperiod and therefore require disclosure, registrants should consider whether overall expenditures\nrelated to progress under a disclosed target or goal are material in the aggregate and, if so,\nprovide appropriate disclosure. Finally, to the extent that disclosure of material impacts on\nfinancial estimates and assumptions as a direct result of the target or goal is disclosed in response\nto Rule 14-02(h) of Regulation S-X, a registrant would be able to cross-reference to such\ndisclosure.871\nSimilar to the rule proposal, the final rule will permit a registrant to provide the required\ntargets and goals disclosure as part of its discussion pursuant to Item 1502 regarding its transition\nplan or when otherwise discussing material impacts of climate-related risks on its business\nstrategy or business model.872 A registrant will also be permitted to provide the required targets\nin response to these Items, to avoid redundancy, a registrant should provide disclosure of material\nexpenditures regarding the Item where, in its assessment, such disclosure is most appropriate, and then\ncross-reference to this disclosure when responding to the other Items.\n871 See supra note 521.\n872 See 17 CFR 229.1504(a).\n217"

A registrant will not\nbe required to comply with the requirements of Item 1504(c)(2) until the fiscal year immediately\nfollowing the fiscal year of its initial compliance date for the subpart 1500 rules based on its filer\nstatus.874\nWe decline to follow the recommendation of some commenters to require the disclosure\nof whether the registrant has set science-based GHG emission reduction targets under the\nScience Based Targets Initiative, or the extent to which it can achieve its targets or goals using\nexisting technology.875 As we similarly noted when declining to follow a recommendation to\nbroaden transition risk disclosure, the targets and goals disclosure requirement we are adopting is\nconsistent with the TCFD framework, which provides flexibility in terms of which tools or\nmethods a registrant chooses to use, and therefore will limit the targets and goals compliance\nburden for those registrants that are already familiar with the TCFD framework.876 A registrant\nmay elect to provide disclosure regarding these additional items, but they are not required items\nof disclosure.\nb. The Carbon Offsets and RECs Disclosure Requirement (Item 1504(d))\nSimilar to the proposed rule, the final rule includes a disclosure requirement about a\nregistrant\u2019s use of carbon offsets or RECs (Item 1504(d)). Unlike the proposed rule, however, a\n873 See id.\n874 See section II.O.3.\n875 See supra notes 811-812 and accompanying text.\n876 See supra section II.C.1.c.\n218\n\nregistrant will be required to disclose certain information about the carbon offsets or RECs only\nif they have been used as a material component of a registrant\u2019s plan to achieve climate-related\ntargets or goals.877 We have added a materiality qualifier to the final rule to address the concern\nof commenters that the proposed disclosure requirement could result in detailed offsets or RECs\ninformation that is of little use to investors.878 Under the final rule, registrants will need to make\na determination, based upon their specific facts and circumstances, about the importance of such\ncarbon offsets and credits to their overall transition plan and provide disclosure accordingly.\nIf carbon offsets or RECs have been used as a material component of a registrant\u2019s plan\nto achieve climate-related targets or goals, then, similar to the proposed rule, the registrant will\nbe required to disclose: the amount of carbon avoidance, reduction or removal represented by the\noffsets or the amount of generated renewable energy represented by the RECs; the nature and\nsource of the offsets or RECs;879 a description and location of the underlying projects; any\nregistries or other authentication of the offsets or RECs; and the cost of the offsets or RECs.880\nInformation about the source, value, underlying projects, and authentication of the carbon\noffsets or RECs will help investors evaluate the role of these instruments in a registrant\u2019s\nclimate-related strategy and the impacts on its business. For example, understanding the role that\ncarbon offsets or RECs play in a registrant\u2019s climate-related business strategy can help investors\n877 See 17 CFR 229.1504(d).\n878 See, e.g., letters from Beller et al.; and J. Weinstein.\n879 The nature of an offset refers to whether it represents carbon avoidance, reduction, or removal. The nature\nof an REC refers primarily to whether it is bundled or unbundled. The source of an offset or REC refers to\nthe party that has issued the offset or REC. Commenters stated that investors need such detailed\ninformation about offsets or RECs in order to evaluate the effectiveness of a registrant\u2019s transition risk\nstrategy and management of climate-related impacts on its business. See supra notes 831-834 and\naccompanying text.\n880 See 17 CFR 229.1504(d). At the recommendation of commenters, see supra note 835, to clarify that an\noffset can represent carbon avoidance, in addition to carbon reduction or removal, we have added\n\u201cavoidance\u201d to the definition of carbon offset. See 17 CFR 229.1500.\n219\n\nassess the potential risks and financial impacts of pursuing that strategy. Relatedly, a registrant\nthat relies on carbon offsets or RECs as a material component of its plan to achieve its targets or\ngoals might need to consider whether fluctuating supply or demand, and corresponding\nvariability of price, related to carbon offsets or RECs, presents an additional material risk that is\nrequired to be disclosed when discussing its plan to achieve such target or goal pursuant the\nrequirements of subpart 1500.\nAt the recommendation of commenters, in addition to carbon reduction, we have added\nthe amount of carbon avoidance and carbon removal881 represented by carbon offsets as\ndisclosure items to clarify that disclosure is required about offsets representing carbon removal\nand those representing carbon avoidance or reduction if the registrant has used these types of\noffsets as a material part of its climate-related strategy.882 This addition will help investors\nassess the risks associated with the different types of offsets used and how they may affect a\nregistrant\u2019s transition risk management and the related impacts on the registrant\u2019s business and\nfinancial condition.\nAlso, at the recommendation of commenters, we have added the nature of the carbon\noffsets or RECs as a disclosure item in addition to the source of the offsets or RECs.883 This\naddition will help investors understand whether a purchased offset represents carbon avoidance,\nreduction, or removal, and whether an REC is bundled or unbundled. Requiring the disclosure of\n881 A carbon avoidance occurs, e.g., when a company protects a forest from deforestation. A carbon reduction\noccurs when emissions are reduced, e.g., when a company switches from the use of fossil-fuel based energy\nto the use of wind or solar power. A carbon removal occurs when CO is drawn out of the atmosphere and\n2\nsequestered, e.g., by carbon capture and storage technology. See, e.g., letter from Ceres; and Ceres,\nEvaluating the Use of Carbon Credits (Mar. 1, 2022), available at\nhttps://www.ceres.org/resources/reports/evaluating-use-carbon-credits.\n882 See, e.g., letters from Amer. Fin. Reform, Sunrise Project et al.; BCSE; and Ceres.\n883 See, e.g., letters from Amer. Clean Power; and IETA.\n220\n\nthe source of the offset or REC will help investors determine whether the offset has met certain\ncriteria of an established standard-setting body,884 and whether the REC originated from and met\nthe standards of a compliance market or is instead derived from a more loosely regulated\nvoluntary market.885 These factors can affect the value and cost of the offsets and RECs and\ntheir attendant risks. For example, as one commenter noted, a market that develops increased\ndemand for carbon removal offsets, either because of new regulation or stricter voluntary\nstandards for net-zero targets, could result in a significant increase in offset prices, potential\nsupply bottlenecks, and increased transition risk for registrants that assumed the continued\navailability and abundance of cheaper offsets.886\nOne commenter who objected to the proposed offsets and RECs disclosure requirement\nasserted that the Commission lacks statutory authority to regulate offsets and RECs.887 We\ndisagree with that commenter\u2019s characterization of the rule. In requiring the disclosure of certain\ninformation about a registrant\u2019s use of offsets or RECs when such use is a material component of\nthe registrant\u2019s plan to achieve a target or goal that is required to be disclosed, we are not\nadvocating for or against the use of offsets or RECs generally, or for or against the use of certain\ntypes of offsets or RECs. Nor are we substantively regulating their use. As previously\nmentioned, the final rules, including those pertaining to the use of offsets or RECs, are neutral\nregarding any strategy that a registrant may choose to manage a material climate-related risk.\nInstead, like the other climate-related disclosure rules we are adopting, the final rule regarding\n884 See, e.g., letter of IETA (referencing the Carbon Offset Reduction Scheme for International Aviation\n(\u201cCORSIA\u201d) market established by the UN International Civil Aviation Organization (\u201cICAO\u201d) and\nadopted by the U.S. Federal Aviation Authority).\n885 See, e.g., letter from Amer.

GHG Emissions Disclosure (Item 1505)\n1. Proposed Rule\nThe proposed rules would have required a registrant to disclose its GHG emissions888 for\nits most recently completed fiscal year and for the historical fiscal years included in its\nconsolidated financial statements, to the extent such historical GHG emissions data is reasonably\navailable.889 The Commission based the proposed GHG emissions disclosure requirement on the\nconcept of scopes, which are themselves based on the concepts of direct and indirect emissions,\ndeveloped by the GHG Protocol.890 The Commission proposed to require a registrant to disclose\nits Scope 1 emissions, which, similar to the GHG Protocol, were defined to mean the direct GHG\nemissions from operations that are owned or controlled by a registrant.891 The Commission also\nproposed to require a registrant to disclose its Scope 2 emissions, which, similar to the GHG\nProtocol, were defined to mean the indirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased or\n888 We proposed to define \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d as carbon dioxide (\u201cCO \u201d); methane (\u201cCH \u201d); nitrous oxide\n2 4\n(\u201cN O\u201d); nitrogen trifluoride (\u201cNF \u201d); hydrofluorocarbons (\u201cHFCs\u201d); perfluorocarbons (\u201cPFCs\u201d); and\n2 3\nsulfur hexafluoride (\u201cSF \u201d). The greenhouse gases included in the proposed definition reflect the gases that\n6\nare currently commonly referenced by international, scientific, and regulatory authorities as having\nsignificant climate impacts. This list of constituent greenhouse gases is consistent with the gases identified\nby widely used frameworks, such as the Kyoto Protocol, the UN Framework Convention on Climate\nChange, the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the EPA, and the GHG Protocol. See Proposing\nRelease, section II.G.1.a.\n889 See id.\n890 Direct emissions are GHG emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by a registrant, whereas\nindirect emissions are GHG emissions that result from the activities of the registrant but occur at sources\nnot owned or controlled by the registrant. See World Business Council for Sustainable Development and\nWorld Resources Institute, GHG Protocol, Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004), available\nat https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards/ghg-protocol-revised.pdf.\n891 See Proposing Release, section II.G.1.a.\n222\n\nacquired electricity, steam, heat, or cooling that is consumed by operations owned or controlled\nby a registrant.892 By sharing certain basic concepts and a common vocabulary with the GHG\nProtocol, the Commission intended to both elicit consistent, comparable, and reliable climate-\nrelated information for investors, and mitigate the compliance burden of the proposed rules for\nthose registrants that are already disclosing or estimating their GHG emissions pursuant to the\nGHG Protocol.893\nThe Commission further proposed to require a registrant, other than an SRC, to disclose\nits Scope 3 emissions, which, similar to the GHG Protocol, were defined to mean all indirect\nGHG emissions not otherwise included in a registrant\u2019s Scope 2 emissions that occur in the\nupstream and downstream activities of a registrant\u2019s value chain.894 Unlike the proposed\ndisclosure requirement for Scopes 1 and 2 emissions, however, the Commission proposed to\nrequire the disclosure of a registrant\u2019s Scope 3 emissions only if those emissions are material, or\nif the registrant has set a GHG emissions reduction target or goal that includes its Scope 3\nemissions.895 The Commission proposed these limitations regarding Scope 3 disclosure in\nrecognition of the fact that, unlike Scopes 1 and 2 emissions, Scope 3 emissions typically result\nfrom the activities of third parties in a registrant\u2019s value chain and, thus, collecting the\nappropriate data and calculating these emissions would potentially be more difficult than for\nScopes 1 and 2 emissions. Although the Commission recognized that the disclosure of Scope 3\n892 See id.\n893 See Proposing Release, section I.D.2.\n894 See Proposing Release, section II.G.1.a. Upstream emissions include emissions attributable to goods and\nservices that the registrant acquires, the transportation of goods (for example, to the registrant), and\nemployee business travel and commuting. Downstream emissions include the use of the registrant\u2019s\nproducts, transportation of products (for example, to the registrant\u2019s customers), end of life treatment of\nsold products, and investments made by the registrant.\n895 See Proposing Release, section II.G.1.b.\n223\n\nemissions may be important to provide investors with a complete picture of the climate-related\nrisks that a registrant faces\u2014particularly transition risks\u2014it also believed it was necessary to\nbalance the importance of Scope 3 emissions with the potential relative difficulty in data\ncollection and measurement.896\nFor each of its Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions, the proposed rules would have required a\nregistrant to disclose the emissions both disaggregated by each constituent greenhouse gas and in\nthe aggregate, expressed in terms of CO e. The Commission proposed this requirement so that\n2\ninvestors could gain decision-useful information regarding the relative risks to the registrant\nposed by each constituent GHG in addition to the risks posed by its total GHG emissions by\nscope.897 The proposed rules would also have required a registrant to disclose the GHG\nemissions data in gross terms, excluding any use of purchased or generated offsets,898 and in\nterms of GHG intensity.899\nThe proposed rules would have required a registrant to describe the methodology,\nsignificant inputs, and significant assumptions used to calculate its GHG emissions metrics.900\nWhile the proposed GHG emissions disclosure rules shared many features with the GHG\nProtocol, they differed regarding the approach required to set a registrant\u2019s organizational\nboundaries. Those boundaries determine the business operations owned or controlled by a\nregistrant to be included in the calculation of its GHG emissions. The proposed approach would\n896 See id.\n897 See Proposing Release, section II.G.1.a.\n898 See id.\n899 See Proposing Release, section II.G.1.c. The proposed rules would have required the disclosure of GHG\nintensity to be in terms of metric tons of CO e per unit of total revenue and per unit of production for the\n2\nfiscal year.\n900 See Proposing Release, section II.G.2.\n224\n\nhave required a registrant to set the organizational boundaries for its GHG emissions disclosure\nusing the same scope of entities, operations, assets, and other holdings within its business\norganization as those included in, and based upon the same set of accounting principles\napplicable to, its consolidated financial statements.901 The Commission proposed this approach\nin order to provide investors a consistent view of the registrant\u2019s business across its financial and\nGHG emissions disclosures. The same organizational boundaries requirement would have\napplied to each disclosure of a registrant\u2019s Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions.902\nThe rule proposal provided that a registrant may use reasonable estimates when\ndisclosing its GHG emissions as long as it also describes the assumptions underlying, and its\nreasons for using, the estimates. In proposing this provision, the Commission stated that while it\nencouraged registrants to provide as accurate a measurement of its GHG emissions as is\nreasonably possible, it recognized that, in many instances, direct measurement of GHG\nemissions at the source, which would provide the most accurate measurement, may not be\npossible.903\nThe Commission proposed to require the disclosure of a registrant\u2019s GHG emissions as of\nthe end of its most recently completed fiscal year in its Exchange Act annual report for that year\nand in a Securities Act or Exchange Act registration statement filed subsequent to the\ncompliance date for the climate-related disclosure rules.904 The Commission also proposed to\npermit a registrant to use a reasonable estimate of its GHG emissions for its fourth fiscal quarter\nif no actual reported data is reasonably available, together with actual, determined GHG\n901 See Proposing Release, section II.G.2.a.\n902 See id.\n903 See Proposing Release, section II.G.2.d.\n904 See Proposing Release, section II.G.1.a.\n225\n\nemissions data for its first three fiscal quarters when disclosing its GHG emissions for its most\nrecently completed fiscal year, as long as the registrant promptly discloses in a subsequent filing\nany material difference between the estimate used and the actual, determined GHG emissions\ndata for the fourth fiscal quarter.905 The Commission proposed this accommodation to address\nthe concern of some commenters that a registrant may find it difficult to complete its GHG\nemissions calculations for its most recently completed fiscal year in time to meet its disclosure\nobligations for that year\u2019s Exchange Act annual report.906\n2. Comments\na. Overall GHG Emissions Disclosure Requirement\nSeveral commenters supported the proposed requirement to disclose Scopes 1 and 2\nemissions, as well as Scope 3 emissions if material or if included in a registrant\u2019s GHG\nemissions reduction target or goal.907 The most common reason asserted for supporting the\nmandatory disclosure of GHG emissions is that such disclosure would provide investors with\nspecific metrics to assess a registrant\u2019s exposure to transition risks.908 Commenters also\nrelatedly stated that mandatory disclosure of GHG emissions would enable investors to evaluate\na registrant\u2019s progress towards achieving any publicly announced transition targets and goals,909\n905 See Proposing Release, section II.G.1.\n906 See id.\n907 See, e.g., letters from AGs from Cal. et al.; AllianceBernstein; Alphabet et al.; Amazon; Amer. for Fin.\nReform, Sunrise Project et al.; BHP; BP; CalPERS; CalSTRS; Chevron; Etsy; IAC Recommendation;\nMember of the U.S. House of Representatives Kathy Castor and 130 other House Members; Member of the\nU.S. House of Representatives Adam B.

Some asserted that the Commission lacks the\nauthority to require disclosures of information that may come largely from non-public companies\nin registrants\u2019 value chain;918 others questioned the value of Scope 3 emissions disclosures for\ninvestors, citing their concerns about the reliability of the metric;919 others focused on their view\nof the costs and burdens of gathering, validating, and reporting the information.920 A number of\ncommenters representing entities not subject to the Commission\u2019s disclosure authority raised\nserious concerns about the costs and burdens they could face as a result of the requirement on\n915 See, e.g., letter from AGs from Cal. et al.

While not directly opposing the proposed Scope 3 emissions disclosure\nrequirement, another commenter recommended that, due to perceived complexities in the calculation of\nScope 3 emissions, the Commission reconsider this proposed requirement and, if it retains the requirement,\n229\n\nOne commenter supported the disclosure of Scope 3 emissions but only for activities,\nsuch as business travel, over which a registrant has influence or indirect control.928 This\ncommenter also recommended adopting a safe harbor for Scope 3 emissions modeled on the\nPSLRA safe harbors and treating Scope 3 emissions disclosure as furnished rather than filed\nbecause of the \u201cinherent uncertainty\u201d in the estimates and assumptions underlying Scope 3\nemissions disclosure.929\nMany commenters, however, generally opposed the proposed mandatory GHG emissions\ndisclosure requirement, including the disclosure of Scopes 1 and 2 emissions.930 Commenters\nstated that because the proposed disclosure of Scopes 1 and 2 emissions would require such\ndisclosure even when a registrant has not determined climate-related risks to be material, the\nproposed GHG emissions disclosure requirement may not result in decision-useful information\nfor investors.931 Commenters also stated that because the registrants producing 85 to 90 percent\nof the emissions in the United States already report their emissions pursuant to the EPA\u2019s\nGreenhouse Gas Reporting Program, the Commission\u2019s proposed emissions disclosure\nrequirements are unnecessary and the resulting emissions data potentially confusing for\ninvestors.932\nthen it should provide guidance around determining the materiality of Scope 3 emissions as well as more\nexplicit standards to calculate Scope 3 emissions for key industries.

Corp. Gov.\n931 See, e.g., letters from API; Dimensional Fund Advisors; and Soc. Corp. Gov.\n932 See, e.g., letters from API; Chamber; and ConocoPhillips. According to commenters, confusion could\nresult from the fact that the EPA\u2019s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (\u201cGHGRP\u201d) requires the disclosure\n230\n\nFurther, commenters opposed the GHG emissions disclosure requirement because of the\nexpected high compliance costs, which they believed the Commission had underestimated.933\nOne commenter further indicated that, although the Commission had stated that many companies\nwere already disclosing their GHG emissions, according to a number of studies, most registrants\nhave not yet measured and reported their Scopes 1 and 2 emissions, let alone their Scope 3\nemissions.934\nCommenters also expressed concerns, in connection with registrants\u2019 disclosure of Scope\n3 emissions, regarding compliance costs involving private companies, which comprise a large\npercentage of many registrants\u2019 value chains or joint ventures, and which, through the influence\nof those registrants, would be compelled to measure and report their GHG emissions for the first\ntime.935 Some of these commenters asserted that registrants would likely incur costs to\nrenegotiate contracts with these third parties to obtain the GHG emissions data required to\ncomply with the proposed rules.936 Another commenter stated that third parties that are\nunwilling or unable to provide their GHG emissions to registrants could eventually be excluded\nof emissions by individual source whereas the Commission\u2019s proposed rules would require the disclosure\nby company; see also discussion infra notes 2593-2595 and accompanying text. As noted in section\nIV.A.3, we estimate that approximately 365 registrants had an ownership stake in facilities that reported to\nthe GHGRP in 2022; see infra note 2596 and accompanying text.\n933 See infra sections IV.C.3.b.ii and iii for more information on specific cost estimates provided by\ncommenters.\n934 See infra section IV.A.5c (citing statistics in the 2021 TCFD Status Report and a Moody\u2019s Analytics\nanalysis of TCFD reporting of 2020/21 public disclosures showing that only 21% of North American\ncompanies and 19% of U.S. companies reported their Scopes 1 and 2 emissions and, if appropriate, their\nScope 3 emissions).\n935 See, e.g., letters from API; Atlas Sand; Bipartisan Policy; Brigham Exploration; Chamber; ConocoPhillips;\nIndependent Petroleum Association of New Mexico; and Iowa Commissioner of Insurance.\n936 See, e.g., letter from ConocoPhillips.\n231\n\nfrom consideration for contracts to provide goods or services to registrants, which could diminish\nopportunities for these third-parties, which may often be smaller businesses.937\nIn addition, commenters stated that, even if registrants are already voluntarily disclosing\ntheir Scopes 1 and 2 emissions pursuant to the GHG Protocol, those registrants will incur an\nincreased compliance burden if the Commission was to adopt the proposed GHG emissions\ndisclosure requirement, because of differences between the Commission\u2019s proposed requirement\nand the GHG Protocol and the TCFD.938 These commenters also shared many of the concerns\nabout the proposed Scope 3 emissions disclosure provision discussed above, including the\ndifficulties of collecting emissions data from third parties in its value chain, the unreliability of\nreported data stemming from third parties\u2019 lack of sophisticated data collection technologies and\nthe use of proxy data to fill data gaps, and the absence of a fully developed and uniformly\naccepted methodology to report Scope 3 emissions. According to commenters, these concerns\nwould increase compliance costs and raise a registrant\u2019s liability exposure so that the total cost of\nthe Scope 3 emissions disclosure would likely exceed its benefit.939 Because of the difficulties\nand uncertainties involved in Scope 3 emissions disclosure, some commenters recommended that\nthe reporting of Scope 3 emissions should remain voluntary.940\n937 See letter from Soc. Corp. Gov.\n938 See id. Specifically, the commenter noted that the proposed rules would require a registrant\u2019s\norganizational boundaries to be consistent with the scope of entities included in its consolidated financial\nstatements, whereas the GHG Protocol permits a company to choose between an equity share, operational\ncontrol, or financial control method. The commenter also noted that the Commission\u2019s proposed rules\nwould require a company to disclose its GHG emissions both on a disaggregated and aggregated basis\nwhereas the TCFD requires a company to disclose its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions, without specifying\nwhether the disclosure must be on a disaggregated basis. According to the commenter, these differences\ncould result in an increased compliance burden for a registrant. We discuss additional commenter input on\nthese differences below.\n939 See id; see also Bipartisan Policy; Brigham Exploration; Chamber; D. Burton, Heritage Fdn.; and the\nNational Association of Convenience Stores (June 8, 2022).\n940 See, e.g., letter from Airlines for America.\n232\n\nOne commenter presented an alternative to the proposed GHG emissions requirement.941\nThis commenter stated that, rather than adopting the proposed GHG emissions disclosure\nrequirement, the Commission should \u201cmandate reporting, on a standardized form, of emissions\ndata that registrants are required to disclose publicly pursuant to other federal, state, or foreign\nregulations.\u201d This commenter also stated that the alternative set of rules \u201cwould, in effect,\nintegrate the existing EPA reporting regime with the SEC\u2019s disclosure system in a manner that\nwould be easier for investors and registrants to access and analyze.\u201d942 This commenter further\nstated that approximately 40 foreign countries already require various forms of emissions\ndisclosures, and that California and other states are considering the adoption of their own\nmandatory emissions reporting regimes.943 According to this commenter, the alternative set of\nrules \u201cwould efficiently integrate, aggregate, and collate those disclosures on a single form\navailable to all investors through documents provided to the Commission.\u201d944\nSome commenters supported the proposed exemption from Scope 3 emissions reporting\nfor SRCs.945 Some commenters also supported exempting SRCs from the requirement to\ndisclose Scopes 1 and 2 emissions because, in their experience, SRCs have not historically\ntracked their GHG emissions and exempting SRCs from a GHG emissions reporting requirement\nwould be consistent with a scaled disclosure regime for such issuers.946\n941 See letter from Joseph A.

Presentation of the GHG Emissions Metrics and Underlying Methodologies\nand Assumptions\nCommenters expressed mixed views on the proposed requirement to disclose GHG\nemissions on both an aggregated and disaggregated basis. Some commenters supported the\nproposed requirement because each constituent gas may be subject to differing regulations and\npresents its own set of risks, which aggregated disclosure, by itself, would conceal.954 Other\ncommenters supported the proposed requirement because it would standardize the GHG\nemissions disclosure and help investors compare the GHG emissions data when making their risk\nassessments regarding a registrant.955 Still other commenters supported the proposed\nrequirement because it is consistent with the GHG Protocol and would generally enhance the\ntransparency of GHG emissions disclosure, which they viewed as fundamental for investors\nbecause it helps investors understand the financial impacts that transition risk may have on a\nregistrant\u2019s business and financial condition, including on its liquidity and capital resources.956\nOther commenters, however, opposed the proposed requirement to disclose GHG\nemissions on a disaggregated basis because they believe it would impose additional costs without\nnecessarily resulting in material disclosure.957 Several of these commenters stated that a\nregistrant should only be required to disclose disaggregated data for constituent gases that are\n953 See, e.g., letters from ICI; PwC; and Soros.\n954 See, e.g., letters from PwC; and WRI.\n955 See, e.g., letters from Amer. for Fin.

Hileman Consulting; ERM CVS; and Futurepast (June 16, 2022).\n236\n\nMany commenters stated that a registrant should be required to calculate its GHG\nemissions pursuant to the GHG Protocol because the GHG Protocol\u2019s methodologies have been\nwidely accepted and requiring their adherence would promote comparability.966 Several of these\ncommenters further recommended that the Commission allow registrants to follow the GHG\nProtocol\u2019s methodology regarding setting organizational boundaries967 instead of the proposed\nrequirement to base a registrant\u2019s organizational boundaries on the entities included in its\nconsolidated financial statements. One of these commenters stated that because many registrants\nuse the \u201coperational control\u201d approach permitted under the GHG Protocol, allowing such\nregistrants to continue to follow the GHG Protocol in this regard would mitigate the compliance\nburden of GHG emissions disclosure because those registrants would not be required to\nimplement a different approach, in particular, regarding equity method investees.968 Some\ncommenters, however, stated that a registrant should be permitted to follow other climate-related\nstandards, such as certain International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards, used\nby some companies when calculating their GHG emissions.969\n966 See, e.g., letters from Alphabet et al.; As You Sow; Beller et al.; CalSTRS; CFA; Dell; Deloitte & Touche;\nEngine No. 1; ERM CVS; KPMG; Morningstar; Soc.

Gov\n(stating that because many registrants use the operational control method, the proposed GHG emissions\nrequirement would not only require unnecessary additional time, effort, and resources and present\nsignificant challenges, but it would also generate discrepancies between earlier-reported data and data\ndisclosed pursuant to the proposed rule).

GHG\u201d).\n237\n\nSeveral commenters supported the proposed requirement to disclose gross emissions by\nexcluding any purchased or generated carbon offsets.970 Commenters stated that requiring the\ndisclosure of gross emissions would enable investors to gain a full picture of a registrant\u2019s\nemissions profile and better assess its transition risk exposure.971 Some commenters also pointed\nto perceived problems in carbon offset markets regarding the quality and permanence of offsets\nwhen supporting a gross emissions disclosure requirement.972 Other commenters stated that a\nregistrant should be required to disclose both a total amount with, and a total amount without, the\nuse of offsets for each scope of emissions because such disclosure would increase transparency\non offset use, which is critical to understanding how a registrant is managing transition risk to its\nbusiness.973\nSome commenters, however, opposed the proposed requirement to exclude carbon offsets\nwhen disclosing GHG emissions.974 These commenters stated that the purchase of carbon offsets\nis a legitimate means for a registrant to reduce its carbon emissions and expressed the view that\nhigh-quality carbon offsets should play a significant role in a transition to a lower carbon\neconomy.975\n970 See, e.g., letters from AllianceBernstein; Amer. for Fin.

Weinstein\n(opposed to any requirement to exclude carbon offsets when disclosing GHG emissions).\n975 See letters from Airlines for America; and SIFMA.\n238\n\nA number of commenters supported the proposed requirement to disclose GHG\nemissions in terms of GHG intensity.976 These commenters stated that investors would find the\ndisclosure of GHG intensity useful because it would help them assess a registrant\u2019s progress in\nachieving its emissions management and reduction goals, put in context its emissions in relation\nto its scale, and facilitate comparing the registrant\u2019s emissions efficiency with other registrants in\nthe same industry.977 Some commenters also noted that the TCFD recommends the disclosure of\nGHG emissions both in absolute terms and terms of intensity because each metric serves a\ndifferent purpose.978 For example, one commenter stated that the disclosure of emissions in\nabsolute terms provides necessary baseline emissions data whereas normalizing the data using an\nintensity metric allows for a focus on emissions efficiency per unit of production relevant to the\nregistrant\u2019s industry.979 While some commenters supported the proposed requirement to disclose\nGHG intensity in terms of both metric tons of CO e per unit of total revenue and per unit of\n2\nproduction relevant to the registrant\u2019s industry,980 other commenters recommended making the\nfinal rules more flexible by expressly permitting registrants to use other GHG intensity\nmetrics.981\n976 See, e.g., letters from Amazon; BOA; CalPERS; D.

Timeline for Reporting GHG Emissions Metrics\nSome commenters supported the proposed requirement to provide GHG emissions\ndisclosure for the registrant\u2019s most recently completed fiscal year and for the appropriate,\ncorresponding historical fiscal years included in the registrant\u2019s consolidated financial statements\nin the filing, to the extent such historical GHG emissions data is reasonably available.991 Other\ncommenters, however, stated that the GHG emissions disclosure requirement should be applied\ninitially only to the most recently completed fiscal year following the date of compliance, with\nGHG emissions disclosure for historical periods required prospectively only.992\nSeveral commenters supported the proposed requirement to disclose a registrant\u2019s GHG\nemissions as of fiscal year-end in its corresponding Exchange Act annual report.993 Commenters\nstated that the proposed timeline for reporting a registrant\u2019s GHG emissions should be consistent\nwith the timeline for its financial reporting to maximize the use of the GHG emissions data and\nto enhance the data\u2019s comparability.994 One commenter further stated that the timing of a\nregistrant\u2019s emissions data disclosure should be coincident with its financial statement data\n989 See letter from C2ES.\n990 See letter from ERM CVS.\n991 See, e.g., letters from Morningstar; Salesforce; Unilever; and WRI.\n992 See, e.g., letters from Alphabet et al.; ABA; BHP; BlackRock; BOA; BP; Chamber; Citigroup; Cleary\nGottlieb; Dell; D.

Final Rule\na. Overview of the GHG Emissions Disclosure Requirement\nAs many commenters have indicated, investors view information about a registrant\u2019s\nGHG emissions, including its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions, as a central measure and indicator of the\nregistrant\u2019s exposure to transition risk as well as a useful tool for assessing its management of\ntransition risk and understanding its progress towards a registrant\u2019s own climate-related targets\nno later than the due date for the Form 10-Q for the second quarter in the subsequent fiscal year); and\nSIFMA (recommending inclusion in the Form 10-Q for the second quarter in the subsequent fiscal year or\nin a Form 6-K furnished at a comparable time).\n1001 See letter from Cleary Gottlieb.\n1002 See, e.g., letters from Blackrock; and GM (suggesting alignment with GHG emissions reporting deadline of\nother agencies (90-120 days after fiscal year-end)).\n1003 See, e.g., letters from ACLI; Can.

We\nrecognize commenters\u2019 concerns about the potentially high cost of compliance associated with\nthe proposed GHG emissions disclosure requirement, including Scopes 1 and 2 emissions,1009 as\nwell as concerns about the current availability and reliability of the underlying data for Scope 3\nemissions.1010 To help address these concerns, instead of requiring, as proposed, the disclosure\nof Scopes 1 and 2 emissions by all registrants regardless of their materiality, the final rules will\nrequire the disclosure of Scope 1 emissions and/or Scope 2 emissions metrics1011 by LAFs and\nAFs that are not SRCs or EGCs, on a phased in basis,1012 if such emissions are material.1013\n1008 See, e.g., letters from AGs of Cal. et al.; AllianceBernstein; CalPERS; CalSTRS; IAA; Miller/Howard;\nMorningstar; Trillium; and Wellington Mgmt.\n1009 See supra notes 933 to 935 and accompanying text.\n1010 See supra notes 924-925 and accompanying text.\n1011 The concept of scopes was developed as part of the GHG Protocol. See World Business Council for\nSustainable Development and World Resources Institute, GHG Protocol, Corporate Accounting and\nReporting Standard (2004), available at https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards/ghg-protocol-\nrevised.pdf. We understand that some registrants may measure their GHG emissions pursuant to other\nwell-established standards, such as ISO 14064 and related ISO standards, which do not refer to scopes. For\nthe purposes of the final rules, we have defined \u201cScope 1 emissions\u201d and \u201cScope 2 emissions,\u201d\nrespectively, as a registrant\u2019s direct emissions and indirect emissions largely from the generation of\npurchased or acquired electricity consumed by the registrant\u2019s operations. We intend these definitions to\ninclude substantially similar emissions as those measured pursuant to the ISO standards. Accordingly,\nregistrants have flexibility to leverage standards of their choice in calculating and disclosing GHG\nemissions metrics required by the final rules, including the GHG Protocol or relevant ISO standards, or\nother standards that may be established over time.\n1012 As discussed in section II.O below, LAFs will have a one-year transition period before they are required to\ncomply with the final rule\u2019s GHG emissions disclosure requirements. AFs that are not SRCs or EGCs will\nbe required to comply with the final rule\u2019s GHG emissions disclosure requirements two years following the\nGHG emissions compliance date for LAFs.\n1013 See 17 CFR 229.1505(a)(1). To the extent Scope 1 and/or 2 emissions disclosure are required under the\nfinal rules, 17 CFR 230.409 or 17 CFR 240.12b-21, which provide accommodations for information that is\nunknown and not reasonably available, would be available if its conditions are met.\n244\n\nAs commenters have noted, some registrants already measure their GHG emissions,\ntypically Scopes 1 and 2 emissions,1014 and some use the data to manage their transition risk\nexposure or monitor their progress towards achieving climate-related targets and goals.1015\nMany other registrants, however, have determined that climate is not a material risk to their\nbusiness, or are not currently measuring their GHG emissions.1016\nIn balancing these considerations, we are not mandating Scopes 1 and/or 2 emissions\ndisclosures from all registrants. Rather, under the final rule, if either or both of those categories\nof GHG emissions are material, and the registrant is an LAF or an AF other than an SRC or\nEGC, it must disclose its Scopes 1 and/or 2 emissions metrics.1017 As we stated when discussing\na registrant\u2019s determination of material impacts of climate-related risks, we intend that a\nregistrant apply traditional notions of materiality under the Federal securities laws when\nevaluating whether its Scopes 1 and/or 2 emissions are material.1018 Thus, materiality is not\ndetermined merely by the amount of these emissions. Rather, as with other materiality\ndeterminations under the Federal securities laws and Regulation S-K, the guiding principle for\nthis determination is whether a reasonable investor would consider the disclosure of an item of\ninformation, in this case the registrant\u2019s Scope 1 emissions and/or its Scope 2 emissions,\n1014 See supra note 916 and accompanying text.\n1015 See id.\n1016 Although the TCFD has reported a significant increase in the number of companies that have publicly\ndisclosed their GHG emissions across the globe in recent years, a minority of North American and U.S.\ncompanies have done so. The TCFD recently reported that only 30% of North American companies\nsurveyed reported their Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions in 2021. See TCFD, supra note 768.\n1017 If a registrant is an LAF or an AF other than an SRC or EGC and its Scope 1 emissions are material but its\nScope 2 emissions are not material, then, under the final rules, the registrant must disclose its Scope 1\nemissions and is not required to disclose its Scope 2 emissions (and vice versa if its Scope 2 emissions are\nmaterial but its Scope 1 emissions are not). If a registrant\u2019s Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions both are\nmaterial, then it must disclose both categories of emissions.\n1018 See, e.g., supra note 381 and accompanying text.\n245\n\nimportant when making an investment or voting decision or such a reasonable investor would\nview omission of the disclosure as having significantly altered the total mix of information made\navailable.\nA registrant\u2019s Scopes 1 and/or 2 emissions may be material because their calculation and\ndisclosure are necessary to allow investors to understand whether those emissions are significant\nenough to subject the registrant to a transition risk that will or is reasonably likely to materially\nimpact its business, results of operations, or financial condition in the short- or long-term. For\nexample, where a registrant faces a material transition risk that has manifested as a result of a\nrequirement to report its GHG emissions metrics under foreign or state law1019 because such\nemissions are currently or are reasonably likely to be subject to additional regulatory burdens\nthrough increased taxes or financial penalties, the registrant should consider whether such\nemissions metrics are material under the final rules. A registrant\u2019s GHG emissions may also be\nmaterial if their calculation and disclosure are necessary to enable investors to understand\nwhether the registrant has made progress toward achieving a target or goal or a transition plan\nthat the registrant is required to disclose under the final rules.\nConversely, the fact that a registrant is exposed to a material transition risk does not\nnecessarily result in its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions being de facto material to the registrant.\nFor example, a registrant could reasonably determine that it is exposed to a material transition\nrisk for reasons other than its GHG emissions, such as a new law or regulation that restricts the\n1019 See supra section II.A.3 (discussing adoption of the ISSB climate disclosure standard and the foreign\njurisdictions that intend to implement the standard and California\u2019s recently adopted laws requiring certain\nlarge corporations to disclose their GHG emissions metrics and their climate-related financial risks).\n246\n\nsale of its products based on the technology it uses, not directly based on its emissions.1020 Such\na risk may trigger disclosure under other provisions of subpart 1500 but may not necessarily\ntrigger disclosure of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions information under Item 1505.1021\nThis revised approach to GHG emissions disclosure will provide investors with\ninformation they need to make informed investment and voting decisions while addressing\nconcerns regarding the disclosure of GHG emissions data that may be immaterial. This approach\nwill also limit the compliance costs of the final rules, as it will not require disclosure of GHG\nemissions data where such data is immaterial. Basing the GHG emissions disclosure\nrequirement on traditional notions of materiality, which are fundamental to U.S. securities laws\nand the Commission\u2019s securities regulation, is more appropriate than a requirement that relies on\nGHG emissions disclosure laws or regulations required by other Federal agencies and foreign or\nstate jurisdictions, as one commenter recommended.1022 Those other laws or regulations may be\nadopted to serve other purposes and may be presented without the additional disclosures that\nsupplement the \u201ctotal mix\u201d of information investors need for context and to understand why the\nGHG emissions information is material.\nWe acknowledge, however, that registrants could incur costs to assess and monitor the\nmateriality of their emissions, even in situations in which they ultimately determine that they do\nnot need to provide disclosure, and that for some registrants these costs could be significant,\nespecially if firms are not already tracking this information for internal purposes.1023 Mindful of\n1020 See, e.g., Simone Foxman, The Electric Revolution Is Coming for Your Lawn Mower, Bloomberg (Nov. 20,\n2023), available at https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-20/gas-lawn-care-ban-in-california-\ntests-electric-leaf-blower-appeal.\n1021 See id.\n1022 See letter from Grundfest.\n1023 See infra section IV.C.2.e.\n247\n\nthese costs, we are further limiting the GHG emissions disclosure requirement to LAFs and AFs\nthat are not SRCs or EGCs and on a phased in basis. These further limitations will help ensure\nthat any registrants potentially subject to the final rule have sufficient resources and time to\nprepare for what we acknowledge could be a significant additional compliance obligation.1024\nWe recognize that many commenters supported the proposed requirement for disclosure\nof Scopes 1 and 2 emissions for all registrants. Nevertheless, mindful of the attendant costs, we\nbelieve that the final rules present an appropriate means to achieve the primary benefits of GHG\nemissions disclosure, namely: providing investors with material metrics that will aid in the\nassessment of transition risk for those registrants that have identified a material climate risk; and\nfacilitating investors\u2019 evaluation of a registrant\u2019s progress towards achieving a material target or\ngoal and the attendant effects on the registrant\u2019s business, results of operations, or financial\ncondition. While the final GHG emissions disclosure provision will not apply to as many\nregistrants or achieve the same level of comparability as may have been achieved under the\nproposed rules, on balance, we believe that, coupled with the other disclosures required under\nsubpart 1500 and the structured data requirements of the final rules, investors will have sufficient\ninformation to assess the operational and financial impact of transition risks and strategies on\nregistrants and compare such impacts across registrants.\nb. Presentation of the GHG Emissions Metrics and Disclosure of the Underlying\nMethodologies and Assumptions\nIn a change from the rule proposal, which would have required the disclosure of a\nregistrant\u2019s GHG emissions both disaggregated by each constituent GHG and in the aggregate,\n1024 As discussed below, neither EGCs nor SRCs will be required to disclose their Scopes 1 and 2 emissions\nunder the final rules. See 17 CFR 229.1505(a)(3)(i).\n248\n\nthe final rule will require the disclosure of any described scope of emissions to be expressed in\nthe aggregate in terms of CO e.1025 This change is intended to address the concern of some\n2\ncommenters that the proposed approach would impose additional burdens and costs on\nregistrants without necessarily resulting in material information for investors.1026 In addition, if\na registrant is required to disclose its Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions, and any constituent gas\nof the disclosed emissions is individually material, it must also disclose such constituent gas\ndisaggregated from the other gases.1027 For example, if a registrant has included a particular\nconstituent gas, such as methane, in a GHG emissions reduction target that is disclosed pursuant\nto Item 1504(a) because it is reasonably likely to materially affect the registrant\u2019s business, such\nconstituent gas may be material and, therefore, required to be disclosed in disaggregated fashion.\nThe required disaggregated disclosure of an individually material gas will help inform investors\nabout the degree to which a registrant is exposed to transition risk as governments and markets\nmay treat the individual GHG components differently.1028 As explained in the Proposing\nRelease, requiring a standard unit of measurement for GHG emissions with which many\nregistrants are familiar should simplify the disclosure for investors and enhance its comparability\nacross registrants with different types of GHG emissions.1029\n1025 See 17 CFR 229.1505(a)(2)(i).\n1026 See supra note 957 and accompanying text.\n1027 See 17 CFR 229.1505(a)(2)(i).\n1028 For example, the EPA recently adopted a new regulation to curb methane emissions, which could be a\nsource of transition risk for some registrants. See EPA, EPA's Final Rule for Oil and Natural Gas\nOperations Will Sharply Reduce Methane and Other Harmful Pollution (Dec. 2, 2023), available at\nhttps://www.epa.gov/controlling-air-pollution-oil-and-natural-gas-operations/epas-final-rule-oil-and-\nnatural-gas.\n1029 See Proposing Release, section II.G.1.\n249\n\nConsistent with the rule proposal, under the final rule, a registrant that is required to\ndisclose its Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions must disclose those emissions in gross terms by\nexcluding the impact of any purchased or generated offsets.1030 As noted by some commenters,\nthis requirement will enable investors to gain a more complete understanding of the full\nmagnitude of a registrant\u2019s exposure to transition risk and to assess the extent to which a\nregistrant relies upon purchased or generated offsets, if the registrant provides disclosure about\nthe offsets pursuant to Item 1504, and better compare such exposure across registrants.1031\nInformation about the degree to which a registrant\u2019s strategy relies on offsets is increasingly\nimportant for investors not only because their use exposes the registrant to offset market\nfluctuations but also because such use may indicate heightened transition risk exposure to the\nextent governments seek to regulate their use.1032\nAlso, similar to the rule proposal,1033 the final rule will require a registrant to describe the\nmethodology, significant inputs, and significant assumptions used to calculate the registrant\u2019s\ndisclosed GHG emissions.1034 We continue to believe that this information is important to\ninvestors because it will help them understand GHG emissions disclosures by providing\n1030 See 17 CFR 229.1505(a)(2)(ii). While the rule specifies that gross emissions should be calculated without\ntaking into account any purchased or generated offsets, the extent to which a registrant will exclude RECs\nfrom its gross emissions will depend on the methodology the registrant chooses to use. As described in the\nProposing Release, section II.G.2., there are two common methods for calculating Scope 2 emissions: the\nmarket-based method and the location-based method. The market-based method may involve the use of\nRECs. See World Resources Institute, GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance (2015), Chapter 4, available at\nhttps://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards/Scope%202%20Guidance_Final_Sept26.pdf. A\nregistrant is required to describe its methodology, and in the case of Scope 2 emissions, it should include a\ndescription of whether and how RECs factor into its gross emissions calculation.\n1031 See, e.g., letters from ICI; and Wellington Mgmt.\n1032 See California Legislative Information, Assembly Bill No. 1305, Voluntary carbon market disclosures\n(Oct. 7, 2023), available at\nhttps://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB1305.\n1033 See Proposing Release, section II.G.2.\n1034 See 17 CFR 229.1505(b)(1).\n250\n\nimportant contextual information, such as the scope of the entities included in the GHG\nemissions results that may be subject to transition risk, and inform comparability across\nregistrants while also providing registrants with flexibility to determine the appropriate\nmethodologies and assumptions to use based on their own facts and circumstances. However,\nwe have modified the proposed requirement to provide registrants with greater flexibility to\npresent this information in a manner that best fits with their particular facts and circumstances, as\nseveral commenters recommended.1035 For example, like the rule proposal, the final rule will\nrequire a registrant to disclose the organizational boundaries used when calculating its Scope 1\nemissions and/or its Scope 2 emissions.1036 Unlike the rule proposal, however, which would\nhave required a registrant to use the same scope of entities and other assets included in its\nconsolidated financial statements when determining the organizational boundaries for its GHG\nemissions calculation,1037 the final rule provides that the registrant must disclose the method used\nto determine the organizational boundaries, and if the organizational boundaries materially differ\nfrom the scope of entities and operations included in the registrant\u2019s consolidated financial\nstatements, the registrant must provide a brief explanation of this difference in sufficient detail\nfor a reasonable investor to understand. In addition, when describing its organizational\nboundaries, a registrant must describe the method used to determine those boundaries.1038 Under\nthis approach, a registrant will have flexibility to use, for example, one of the methods for\ndetermining control under the GHG Protocol, including the operational control approach, as\n1035 See, e.g., letters from ABA; Chamber; SIFMA; and Soc. Corp. Gov.\n1036 Like the rule proposal, the final rule defines \u201corganizational boundaries\u201d to mean the boundaries that\ndetermine the operations owned or controlled by a registrant for the purpose of calculating its GHG\nemissions. See 17 CFR 229.1500.\n1037 See Proposing Release, section II.G.2.a.\n1038 See 17 CFR 229.1505(b)(1)(i).\n251\n\nrecommended by some commenters,1039 as long as it discloses the method used, and provides\ninvestors with information material to understanding the scope of entities and operations\nincluded in the GHG emissions calculation as compared to those included in its financial\nstatements. We have made this change to address widely shared concerns about the compliance\nburden and associated costs of the more prescriptive aspects of the rule proposal.1040 At the\nsame time, requiring the registrant to provide a brief explanation of any material difference from\nthe scope of entities and operations included in the consolidated financial statements will help\navoid any potential confusion on the part of investors about the scope of entities included in the\nGHG emissions calculation and help them assess the extent of the registrant\u2019s transition risk-\nrelated financial impacts.\nSimilarly, we have also streamlined the methodology disclosure provision by, for\nexample, specifying that a brief discussion, in sufficient detail for a reasonable investor to\nunderstand, is required of the operational boundaries used,1041 including the approach to\ncategorization of emissions and emissions sources.1042 This provision is intended to provide\ninvestors with a general understanding of how the registrant determined which sources of\nemissions to include when calculating its direct emissions (Scope 1) and indirect emissions\n(Scope 2) to facilitate investors\u2019 understanding of the GHG emissions results and enhance their\ncomparability across registrants while avoiding extensive disclosure that may be more\nburdensome for registrants to produce or investors to process.\n1039 See supra note 967 and accompanying text.\n1040 See supra notes 956 and 968 and accompanying text.\n1041 Like the rule proposal, the final rule defines \u201coperational boundaries\u201d to mean the boundaries that\ndetermine the direct and indirect emissions associated with the business operations owned or controlled by\na registrant. See 17 CFR 229.1500.\n1042 See 17 CFR 229.1505(b)(1)(ii).\n252\n\nWhereas the rule proposal would have required the disclosure of the calculation\napproach, including any emission factors used and the source of the emission factors,1043 and any\ncalculation tools used to calculate the GHG emissions, the final rule requires a brief description\nof, in sufficient detail for a reasonable investor to understand, the protocol or standard used to\nreport the GHG emissions, including the calculation approach, the type and source of any\nemission factors used, and any calculation tools used to calculate the GHG emissions.1044 Rather\nthan potentially requiring a lengthy explanation of the calculation approach used, this provision\nwill require a registrant to disclose whether it calculated its GHG emissions metrics using an\napproach pursuant to the GHG Protocol\u2019s Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, an\nEPA regulation, an applicable ISO standard,1045 or another standard. Pursuant to this provision,\nwe would expect a registrant to also disclose whether it calculated its Scope 2 emissions using a\nparticular method (which may differ from the method used to calculate Scope 1 emissions, to the\nextent both Scope 1 and 2 emissions are required to be disclosed under the final rules), such as\nthe location-based method, market-based method, or both.1046 Similarly, a registrant should\ndisclose the identity of any calculation tools used, such as those provided by the GHG Protocol\nor pursuant to GHG emissions calculation under the ISO standards. In addition, by modifying\n1043 Emission factors are ratios that typically relate GHG emissions to a proxy measure of activity at an\nemissions source. Examples of activity data reflected in emission factors include kilowatt-hours of\nelectricity used, quantity of fuel used, output of a process, hours of operation of equipment, distance\ntravelled, and floor area of a building. The EPA has published a series of commonly used emission factors.\nSee EPA, Emission Factors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories (Apr. 2021), available at\nhttps://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2021-04/documents/emission-factors_apr2021.pdf. See also 17\nCFR 229.1500 (definition of \u201cemission factors\u201d).\n1044 See 17 CFR 229.1505(b)(1)(iii).\n1045 See supra note 969.\n1046 The market-based method and the location-based method are two common methods for calculating Scope 2\nemissions for purchased electricity. For a description of these methods, see World Resources Institute,\nGHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, Chapter 7, available at https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/ghg-protocol-\nscope-2-guidance.pdf; and EPA Center for Corporate Climate Leadership, Scope 1 and Scope 2 Inventory\nGuidance, available at https://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/scope-1-and-scope-2-inventory-guidance.\n253\n\nthe proposed requirement to disclose any emission factors used, we are clarifying that the final\nrule will not require the disclosure of any quantitative emission factors used. Instead, the final\nrule will require a registrant to disclose the type and source of any emission factors used, such as\nthe EPA\u2019s emission factors for stationary combustion and/or mobile combustion of various fuel\ntypes.1047\nRequiring a brief description of the protocol or standard used to calculate a registrant\u2019s\nGHG emissions, together with the type and source of any emission factors used, will provide\ninvestors with information that is important to understanding the reported emissions data and\nassociated risks1048 without burdening registrants by requiring disclosure of detailed information\nthat may not be material.1049 Such disclosure should assist investors in understanding the\nemission disclosures and promote consistency and comparability over time. For example, with\nthe required disclosures, an investor will be able to evaluate the registrant\u2019s selected emission\nfactor(s) in the context of its operations and assess whether changes in reported emissions over\ntime reflect changes in actual emissions in accordance with its strategy or simply a change in\ncalculation methodology.\nUnlike the rule proposal, which would have required a registrant to disclose its GHG\nemissions in both absolute terms and terms of intensity,1050 under the final rule, registrants will\nnot be required to disclose its GHG emissions in terms of intensity. As some commenters noted,\n1047 The EPA has published a set of emission factors based on the particular type of source (e.g., stationary\ncombustion, mobile combustion, refrigerants, and electrical grid, among others) and type of fuel consumed\n(e.g., natural gas, coal or coke, crude oil, and kerosene, among many others. See EPA, Emission Factors\nfor Greenhouse Gas Inventories (Apr. 2021), available at https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2021-\n04/documents/emission-factors_apr2021.pdf.\n1048 See supra note 963 and accompanying text.\n1049 See supra note 964 and accompanying text.\n1050 See Proposing Release, section II.G.1.\n254\n\nthe proposed intensity disclosure requirement is not necessary because investors should be able\nto calculate a registrant\u2019s GHG emissions per unit of total revenue by dividing a registrant\u2019s\ngross GHG emissions by its total revenues.1051 Eliminating the GHG intensity disclosure\nrequirement will also help lower the final rules\u2019 compliance burden. Although a registrant may\nchoose to disclose its GHG emissions in terms of intensity, it is not required under the final rule.\nLike the rule proposal, the final rule provides that a registrant may use reasonable\nestimates when disclosing its GHG emissions as long as it also describes the assumptions\nunderlying, and its reasons for using, the estimates.1052 This explanation will help investors\nunderstand and assess the GHG emissions disclosures and facilitate comparability across\nregistrants. We recognize that, in many instances, direct measurement of GHG emissions at the\nsource, which would provide the most accurate measurement, may not be possible. We also\nrecognize that it is common practice under various GHG emissions reporting methodologies to\nuse estimates, such as emission factors, when calculating a company\u2019s Scopes 1 and 2\nemissions.1053 A registrant may use reasonable estimates under the final rule as long as it\ndescribes the underlying assumptions and explains its reasons for using the estimates. Allowing\nfor the use of reasonable estimates with an explanation will help lower the compliance burden\nfor a registrant that must disclose its GHG emissions without, in our view, unduly undermining\ncomparability and reliability of the GHG emissions metrics disclosure.\n1051 See supra note 983 and accompanying text.\n1052 See 17 CFR 229.1505(b)(2).\n1053 See, e.g., letter from PWC.\n255\n\nc. Exclusions from the GHG Emissions Disclosure Requirement\nWe are not adopting a provision that would require a registrant to disclose its Scope 3\nemissions at this time. We are mindful of the potential burdens such a requirement could impose\non registrants and other parties as well as questions about the current reliability and robustness of\nthe data associated with Scope 3 emissions, as noted by commenters.1054 However, we also\nrecognize that, as some commenters indicated, disclosure of a registrant\u2019s Scope 3 emissions,\nincluding emissions from its suppliers (i.e., upstream emissions) and its customers or consumers\n(i.e., downstream emissions), or at least from those parties in its value chain that have significant\nemissions, may allow investors to develop a fuller picture of the registrant\u2019s transition risk\nexposure and evaluate and compare investment risks across registrants more thoroughly.1055\nMoreover, because many registrants will be required to disclose their Scope 3 emissions under\nforeign or state law or regulation,1056 Scope 3 calculation methodologies may continue to evolve,\nmitigating many of the concerns noted by commenters about the disclosure of Scope 3\nemissions. While such developments may encourage more registrants to disclose their Scope 3\nemissions in Commission filings, at the present time, because of the potential costs and\ndifficulties related to Scope 3 emissions reporting, the disclosure of Scope 3 emissions in\nCommission filings will remain voluntary.\nUnlike the proposed rule, which would have exempted SRCs from the requirement to\ndisclose Scope 3 emissions,1057 the final rule will exempt SRCs and EGCs from any requirement\n1054 See supra notes 924-925 and accompanying text.\n1055 See, e.g., letters from AllianceBernstein; CalPERS; Miller/Howard; Trillium; and Wellington Mgmt.\n1056 See supra section II.A.3.\n1057 See Proposing Release, section II.G.3.\n256\n\nto disclose its GHG emissions, including its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions.1058 Such treatment is\nconsistent with the scaled disclosure approach that is sometimes adopted for SRCs and EGCs.1059\nWe understand from commenters that SRCs and EGCs will face the greatest burden and costs in\nattempting to comply with the GHG emissions disclosure requirement as compared to the other\nclimate-related disclosure requirements.1060 Accordingly, exempting SRCs and EGCs from this\nrequirement but requiring them to comply with the final rules\u2019 other climate-related disclosure\nrequirements should allow investors in SRCs and EGCs to gain a better understanding of the\nmaterial climate risks such companies may be facing while limiting the overall costs to these\nregistrants by alleviating the significant burdens associated with GHG emissions disclosure.\nThe final rules provide that a registrant is not required to include GHG emissions from a\nmanure management system when disclosing its overall Scopes 1 and 2 emissions pursuant to 17\nCFR 229.1505(a)(1).1061 This exclusion from the GHG emissions disclosure requirement has\nbeen included in light of the 2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act, which provides that none of\nthe funds made available under that Act or any other Act (including to the Commission) may be\nused to implement \u201cany provision in a rule, if that provision requires mandatory reporting of\n1058 See 17 CFR 229.1505(a)(3)(i). A registrant will be exempt from any requirement to disclose its GHG\nemissions for any fiscal year in which it qualified as an SRC. A registrant that previously qualified as an\nSRC also will be exempt from the GHG emissions disclosure requirements in the first fiscal year in which\nit no longer so qualifies because a registrant must reflect the determination of whether it came within the\ndefinition of smaller reporting company in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the first fiscal quarter of\nthe next year, see 17 CFR 240.12b-2, which will be after the date of the annual report on Form 10-K in\nwhich the GHG emissions disclosure is required. This remains the case notwithstanding the permissibility\nunder the final rules (as discussed infra Section II.H.3.d) of a registrant incorporating by reference its GHG\nemissions disclosures required in its Form 10-K from its Form 10-Q for the second quarter of that next\nfiscal year.\n1059 See supra notes 946 and accompanying text.\n1060 See, e.g., letter from BIO (When recommending adoption of additional exemptions for small companies\nfrom the proposed rules, this commenter stated that \u201c67% of BIO members surveyed said that they\ncurrently do not report on carbon emissions, and a similar majority have significant concerns with the\nability to collect and accurately report without significant liability.\u201d).\n1061 See 17 CFR 229.1505(a)(3)(ii).\n257\n\ngreenhouse gas emissions from manure management systems.\u201d1062 Accordingly, an agricultural\nproducer or other registrant that operates a manure management system will not be required to\ninclude GHG emissions from that system when disclosing its overall Scopes 1 and 2 emissions\nfor so long as implementation of such a provision is subject to restrictions on appropriated funds\nor otherwise prohibited by Federal law.\nd. Timeline for Reporting GHG Emissions Metrics\nUnder the final rules, if a registrant is required to disclose its Scope 1 and/or Scope 2\nemissions, it must disclose those emissions for its most recently completed fiscal year and, to the\nextent previously disclosed in a Commission filing, for the historical fiscal year(s) included in\nthe consolidated financial statements included in the filing.1063 By contrast, a registrant that has\nnot previously disclosed its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions in a Commission filing for a particular\nhistorical fiscal year will not be required to estimate and report those emissions for such\nperiod.1064 Limiting the historical period disclosure requirement for GHG emissions in this\nfashion is largely consistent with the recommendation of commenters that any GHG emissions\ndisclosure not be required for historical periods prior to the initial compliance date1065 and should\nhelp mitigate the compliance costs for registrants that have not yet disclosed their Scopes 1 and 2\nemissions in a Commission filing. This approach is also consistent with the approach taken for\n1062 Pub. L. No. 117-328, div. G, tit. IV, \u00a7 437, 136 Stat. 4459, 4831 (2022).\n1063 See 17 CFR 229.1505(a)(1).\n1064 For example, if a registrant becomes an LAF during the fiscal year, it is required to present these\ndisclosures for the most recently completed fiscal year in which it became an LAF; however, it is not\nrequired to provide those disclosures for the prior fiscal years included in its filing when it was not an LAF,\nto the extent that information was not previously required to be disclosed.\n1065 See supra note 992 and accompanying text.\n258\n\nthe disclosure of financial effects for historical periods under new Article 14 of Regulation S-\nX,1066 as well as with approaches taken for other recently adopted changes to Regulation S-K.1067\nWe recognize that, as many commenters have stated, a registrant may have difficulty\nmeasuring and reporting its GHG emissions as of fiscal year-end by the same deadline for its\nExchange Act annual report.1068 To address this concern, the final rules provide that any GHG\nemissions metrics required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 1505 in an annual report filed with\nthe Commission on Form 10-K may be incorporated by reference from the registrant\u2019s Form 10-\nQ for the second fiscal quarter in the fiscal year immediately following the year to which the\nGHG emissions metrics disclosure relates.1069 Many commenters requesting additional time to\ndisclose GHG emissions metrics indicated that most registrants currently report such metrics\noutside of Commission filings after completion of the second fiscal quarter. Accordingly, this\nchange will help alleviate the challenges with disclosing such data in the annual report and be\nconsistent with current market practices while still providing investors with timely GHG\nemissions information.\nTo provide comparable treatment for foreign private issuers, the final rules provide that\nthe GHG emissions metrics required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 1505 may be disclosed in\nan amendment to their annual report on Form 20-F, which shall be due no later than 225 days\n1066 See infra section II.K.\n1067 See, e.g., Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis, Selected Financial Data, and Supplementary Financial\nInformation, Release No. 33-10890 (Nov. 19, 2020) [86 FR 2080 (Jan. 11, 2021)]; and Pay Versus\nPerformance, Release No. 34-95607 (Aug. 25, 2022) [87 FR 55134 (Sept. 8, 2022)], which provided\nsimilar transition periods.\n1068 See supra note 998 and accompanying text.\n1069 See 17 CFR 229.1505(c)(1). A registrant may also include this in an amended Form 10-K filed no later\nthan the due date for the registrant\u2019s second quarter Form 10-Q. This deadline would also apply to\ntransition year registrants, i.e., to registrants that have changed their fiscal year and the difference in\nreporting periods is so small that they are not required to file a Form 10-KT and can report the difference in\na Form 10-Q.\n259\n\nafter the end of the fiscal year to which the GHG emissions metrics disclosure relates. This\ncorresponds approximately to the second quarter Form 10-Q filing deadline and should provide\nforeign private issuers with an appropriate and similar amount of time as domestic registrants to\nprovide the required GHG emissions metrics disclosure.1070 In order to treat the GHG emissions\ndisclosure as filed and maintain the same level of liability as for corresponding disclosure by\ndomestic registrants, a foreign private issuer must provide its GHG emissions disclosure in an\namendment to its annual report on Form 20-F instead of on a Form 6-K.\nWhether a registrant is a domestic registrant or foreign private issuer, the final rules\nprovide that the registrant must include an express statement in its annual report indicating its\nintention to incorporate by reference or amend its filing for this information.1071 This\nrequirement will provide notice to investors regarding where to find the required GHG emissions\nmetrics disclosure and is consistent with the general notice requirements for information that is\nbeing incorporated by reference under existing Securities Act and Exchange Act rules.1072\nTo provide similar treatment to GHG emissions metrics required to be disclosed under\nItem 1505 in a Securities Act or Exchange Act registration statement, the final rules state that the\nGHG emissions metrics must be provided as of the most recently completed fiscal year that is at\nleast 225 days prior to the date of effectiveness of the registration statement.1073 For example, if\na calendar year-end LAF files a Form S-1 registration statement in 2028, which goes effective on\n1070 See Form 10-Q, General Instruction A.1, which states that the Form 10-Q must be filed within 40 days after\nthe end of the fiscal quarter if the registrant is an LAF or AF (and, if that 40 day period falls on a Saturday,\nthe filing is not due until the following Monday, which is the 42nd day after the end of the quarter). The\nend of the second fiscal quarter corresponds to 181 days following the most recently completed fiscal year\n(and 182 days in a leap year). The 225-day deadline is intended to account for the upper limit combined\nperiods (42 days + 182 days = 224 days).\n1071 See 17 CFR 229.1505(c)(1).\n1072 See 17 CFR 230.411(e) and 17 CFR 240.12b-23(e).\n1073 See 17 CFR 229.1505(c)(2).\n260"

If,\nhowever, the Form S-1 registration statement goes effective on Friday, August 4, 2028, which is\nless than 225 days after its 2027 fiscal year-end, the registrant may provide its GHG emissions\nmetrics disclosure as of its 2026 fiscal year-end.1074\nI. Attestation Over GHG Emissions Disclosure (Item 1506)\n1. Overview\na. Proposed Rules\nThe Commission proposed to require a registrant, including a foreign private issuer, that\nis an AF or an LAF to include in the relevant filing an attestation report covering the disclosure\nof its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions and to provide certain related disclosures about the service\nprovider providing the attestation report.1075 The proposed rules also included requirements\nrelated to the service provider and requirements for the engagement and the attestation report.1076\n1074 Similarly, for a registration statement on Form S-3, because information is incorporated by reference from\na registrant\u2019s Exchange Act filings, to address the scenario where a Form S-3 registration statement goes\neffective after a registrant files its Form 10-K annual report for its most recently completed fiscal year but\nbefore it has filed its second quarter Form 10-Q containing its GHG emissions metrics disclosure for its\nmost recently completed fiscal year, we have added a provision to Form S-3 stating that the GHG\nemissions metrics disclosure must be as of its most recently completed fiscal year that is at least 225 days\nprior to the date of effectiveness of the Form S-3 registration statement. Accordingly, where a registrant\nhas filed its annual report on Form 10-K for the most recently completed fiscal year but has not yet filed its\nForm 10-Q for the second fiscal quarter containing the disclosure required by 17 CFR 229.1505(a), it must\nincorporate its GHG emissions metrics disclosure for the fiscal year that is immediately prior to its most\nrecently completed fiscal year. See Item 12(e) to Part I of Form S-3. For example, if a calendar year-end\nLAF has a Form S-3 registration statement go effective after it files its Form 10-K for 2028 but before it\nfiles its second quarter Form 10-Q (due no later than Aug. 9, 2029), it must incorporate its GHG emissions\ndisclosure for the 2027 fiscal year previously filed on a Form 10-Q or a Form 10-K/A. We have added a\nsimilar provision to Form F-3. See Item 6(g) to Part I of Form F-3. For any registration statement, if the\ndate of effectiveness is less than 225 days after its most recently completed fiscal year-end, a registrant will\nonly be required to disclose its GHG emissions for the fiscal year that is immediately prior to its most\nrecently completed fiscal year if the registrant was required to disclose its Scope 1 and/or Scope 2\nemissions pursuant to Item 1505 for that year.\n1075 See Proposing Release, section II.H.1.\n1076 See Proposing Release, section II.H.2 and 3.\n261\n\nThe proposed rules would have required the attestation engagement to be performed by the\nservice provider at a \u201climited assurance\u201d level1077 for fiscal years 2 and 3 after the Scopes 1 and\n2 emissions disclosure compliance date and at a reasonable assurance level1078 for fiscal year 4\nand beyond.1079 The Commission explained that during the transition period when limited\nassurance would be required, an AF or an LAF would be permitted to obtain \u201creasonable\nassurance\u201d of its Scope 1 and 2 emissions disclosure at its option.1080\nAlso at its option, an AF or an LAF would have been permitted under the proposed rules\nto obtain any level of assurance over climate-related disclosures that are not subject to the\nproposed assurance requirements.1081 To avoid potential confusion, however, the proposed rules\nwould have required the voluntary assurance obtained by such registrant to follow the\nrequirements of proposed Items 1505(b) through (d), including using the same attestation\nstandard as the required assurance over Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. For filings made by AFs\nand LAFs after the compliance date for the GHG emissions disclosure requirements but before\nproposed Item 1505(a) would require limited assurance, the proposed rules only would have\nrequired the filer to provide the disclosure called for by proposed Item 1505(e) if it chose to\nvoluntarily obtain attestation.1082 The Commission stated that a registrant that is not an AF or\n1077 Limited assurance is equivalent to the level of assurance (commonly referred to as a \u201creview\u201d) provided\nover a registrant\u2019s interim financial statements included in a Form 10-Q.\n1078 Reasonable assurance is equivalent to the level of assurance provided in an audit of a registrant\u2019s\nconsolidated financial statements included in a Form 10-K.\n1079 See Proposing Release, section II.H.1.\n1080 See id.\n1081 See id. For example, the Commission stated that an AF or LAF could voluntarily include an attestation\nreport at the limited assurance level for its GHG intensity metrics or its Scope 3 emissions disclosure.\n1082 See id.\n262\n\nLAF that obtains voluntary assurance would be required to comply only with proposed\nItem 1505(e).1083\nIn the Proposing Release, the Commission stated that requiring GHG emissions\ndisclosure in Commission filings should enhance the consistency, comparability, and reliability\nof such disclosures due to the application of a registrant\u2019s DCP and the proposed inclusion of\ncertain prescriptive elements that may help improve standardization of GHG emission\ncalculations.1084 The Commission also observed that the evolving and unique nature of GHG\nemissions involves and, in some cases, warrants varying methodologies, differing assumptions,\nand a substantial amount of estimation.1085 Certain aspects of GHG emissions disclosure also\ninvolve reliance on third-party data. As such, the Commission concluded that requiring a third-\nparty\u2019s attestation over these disclosures would provide investors with an additional degree of\nreliability regarding not only the figures that are disclosed, but also the key assumptions,\nmethodologies, and data sources the registrant used to arrive at those figures.1086\nIn the Proposing Release, the Commission explained that, although many registrants have\nvoluntarily obtained some level of assurance for their climate-related disclosures,1087 current\nvoluntary climate-related assurance practices have been varied with respect to the levels of\n1083 See id.\n1084 See id.\n1085 See id.\n1086 See id.\n1087 For example, the Commission stated that according to one study, 53% of the S&P 500 companies had some\nform of assurance or verification over climate-related metrics, along with other metrics. See CAQ, S&P\n500 and ESG Reporting (Aug. 9, 2021), available at https://www.thecaq.org/sp-500-and-esg-reporting-\n2019-2020. Another survey of sustainability reporting trends from 5,200 companies across 52 countries\n(including the United States) stated that, of the top 100 companies (by revenue), 80% have reporting on\nESG (including climate), with up to 61% of those companies obtaining assurance. See KPMG, The KPMG\nSurvey of Sustainability Reporting 2020, available at https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2020/11/the-\ntime-has-come-survey-of-sustainability-reporting.html. Proposing Release, section II.H.1.\n263\n\nassurance provided (e.g., limited versus reasonable), the assurance standards used, the types of\nservice providers, and the scope of disclosures covered by the assurance.1088 The Commission\nstated that this fragmentation has diminished the comparability of the assurance provided and\nmay require investors to become familiar with many different assurance standards and the\nvarying benefits of different levels of assurance.1089 Accordingly, to improve accuracy,\ncomparability, and consistency with respect to the proposed GHG emissions disclosure, the\nCommission proposed to require a minimum level of assurance services for AFs and LAFs\nincluding: (1) limited assurance1090 for Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosure that scales up to\nreasonable assurance1091 after a specified transition period; (2) minimum qualifications and\nindependence requirements for the attestation service provider; and (3) minimum requirements\nfor the accompanying attestation report.1092\n1088 See Proposing Release, section II.H.1.\n1089 See id. The Commission noted in the Proposing Release that the consequences of such fragmentation have\nalso been highlighted by certain international organizations, including IOSCO, which stated that it\n\u201cidentified a perceived lack of clarity and consistency around the purpose and scope of [voluntary]\nassurance . . . [which] can potentially lead to market confusion, including misleading investors and\nexacerbating the expectations gap.\u201d IOSCO, Report on Sustainability-related Issuer Disclosures (June\n2021), available at https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD678.pdf. See also, e.g.,\nInternational Federation of Accountants, The State of Play in Sustainability Assurance (June 23, 2021),\navailable at https://www.ifac.org/knowledge-gateway/contributing-global-economy/publications/state-play-\nsustainability-assurance. See Proposing Release, section II.H.1.\n1090 The Commission explained in the Proposing Release that the objective of a limited assurance engagement\nis for the service provider to express a conclusion about whether it is aware of any material modifications\nthat should be made to the subject matter (e.g., the Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosure) in order for it to be\nfairly stated or in accordance with the relevant criteria (e.g., the methodology and other disclosure\nrequirements specified in proposed Item 1504). See Proposing Release, section II.H.1 (citing, for example,\nAICPA\u2019s Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 22, AT-C section 210). In such\nengagements the conclusion is expressed in the form of negative assurance regarding whether any material\nmisstatements have been identified. See id.\n1091 The Commission explained in the Proposing Release that the objective of a reasonable assurance\nengagement, which is the same level of assurance provided in an audit of a registrant\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial statements, is to express an opinion on whether the subject matter is in accordance with the\nrelevant criteria, in all material respects. A reasonable assurance opinion provides positive assurance that\nthe subject matter is free from material misstatement. See Proposing Release, section II.H.1 (citing, for\nexample, AICPA SSAE No. 21, AT-C sections 205 and 206).\n1092 See Proposing Release, section II.H.1.\n264\n\nThe Commission stated that by specifying minimum standards for the attestation\nprovided with respect to GHG emissions disclosure by AFs and LAFs, the proposed rules should\nimprove accuracy and consistency in the reporting of this information, while also providing\ninvestors with an enhanced level of reliability against which to evaluate the disclosure.1093 In\naddition to the proposed minimum standards for attestation services, the Commission explained\nthat the proposed additional disclosure requirements for registrants should further assist investors\nin understanding the qualifications and suitability of the GHG emissions attestation provider\nselected by the registrant, particularly in light of the broad spectrum of attestation providers that\ncurrently provide and that would be permitted under the proposed rules to provide attestation\nservices.1094\nThe Commission explained that the proposed rules did not aim to create or adopt a\nspecific attestation standard for assuring GHG emissions because both the reporting and\nattestation landscapes are currently evolving and it would be premature to adopt one approach\nand potentially curtail future innovations in these two areas.1095 The Commission acknowledged\nin the Proposing Release that the proposed minimum standards for attestation services and the\nproposed additional disclosure requirements would not eliminate fragmentation with respect to\nassurance or obviate the need for investors to assess and compare multiple attestation\nstandards.1096 Nevertheless, the Commission stated it believed some flexibility in its approach\n1093 See id.\n1094 See id.\n1095 See id.\n1096 See id.\n265\n\nwas warranted at this time given the unique and evolving nature of third-party assurance for\nclimate-related disclosures.1097\nIn proposing mandatory assurance of GHG emissions disclosure, the Commission\nweighed the challenges such requirements could present with the benefits that assurance would\nprovide to investors and proposed only requiring AFs and LAFs to obtain an attestation report,\nsubject to a phased in compliance period, to help mitigate concerns about cost and burden.1098 In\naddition, the Commission stated that the proposed phase in periods would provide AFs and LAFs\nwith significant time to develop processes to support their GHG emissions disclosure\nrequirements and the relevant DCP, as well as to adjust to the incremental costs and efforts\nassociated with escalating levels of assurance.1099 During the proposed transition period, GHG\nemissions attestation providers would also have had time to prepare themselves for providing\nsuch services in connection with Commission filings.1100\nIn the Proposing Release, the Commission stated that the voluntary attestation obtained\nby some registrants has been at the reasonable assurance level; however, it acknowledged that a\nlimited assurance engagement is less extensive and currently the level of assurance most\ncommonly provided in the voluntary assurance market for climate-related disclosure.1101 The\n1097 See id.\n1098 See id. The Commission further stated that, for the many LAFs that are already voluntarily obtaining some\nform of assurance over GHG emissions, any cost increases associated with complying with the proposed\nrules would be mitigated and larger issuers generally bear proportionately lower compliance costs than\nsmaller issuers due to the fixed cost components of such compliance.

Final Rules (Item 1506)\nAfter considering comments, we are adopting final rules (Item 1506(a)(1)) that require a\nregistrant, including a foreign private issuer, that is required to provide Scope 1 and/or Scope 2\nemissions disclosure pursuant to Item 1505 to include an attestation report covering the\ndisclosure of its Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions in the relevant filing.1196 However, as\ndiscussed in greater detail below, we made a number of modifications to the proposal to address\ncertain concerns raised by commenters.\n1193 See Proposing Release, section II.H.1.\n1194 See, e.g., letters from CEMEX; CFA Institute (stating that the issue could be revisited by the Commission\nin the future); and Grant Thornton.\n1195 See letter from ERM CVS.\n1196 See 17 CFR 229.1506. Consistent with the Commission\u2019s statement in the Proposing Release, in order to\nattest to Scopes 1 and/or 2 emissions disclosure, a GHG emissions attestation provider will need to include\nin its evaluation relevant contextual information. See Proposing Release, section II.H.1. In particular,\nunder the final rules, the attestation provider will be required to evaluate the registrant\u2019s compliance with\n(i) Item 1505(a), which includes presentation requirements (e.g., disaggregation of any constituent gas if\nindividually material), and (ii) the disclosure requirements in Item 1505(b) regarding methodology,\norganization boundary, and operational boundary. See infra section II.I.3.c for further discussion of the\ncriteria against which the Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosure are measured or evaluated.\n284\n\nUnder the final rules, the attestation engagement must, at a minimum, be at the following\nassurance level for the indicated fiscal year for the required GHG emissions disclosure:1197\nFiler Type Scopes 1 and 2 Emissions Limited Reasonable\nDisclosure Compliance Date Assurance Assurance\nCompliance Date Compliance Date\nLAFs Fiscal year 2026 Fiscal year 2029 Fiscal year 2033\nAFs (other than Fiscal year 2028 Fiscal year 2031 N/A\nSRCs and EGCs)\nAFs (excluding SRCs and EGCs) and LAFs are required to obtain an attestation report\nunder the final rules,1198 consistent with the scope of registrants that are required to comply with\nthe GHG emissions disclosure requirements in Item 1505.1199 As illustrated in the table above,\nthe final rules (Item 1506(a)(1)(i), (ii)) require both AFs and LAFs to obtain limited assurance\nbeginning the third fiscal year after the compliance date for Item 1505; however, under the final\nrules (Item 1506(a)(1)(iii)), only LAFs are required to obtain an attestation report at a reasonable\nassurance level beginning the seventh fiscal year after the compliance date for Item 1505.1200\nThe final rules do not require an AF to obtain an attestation report at a reasonable assurance\nlevel. Consistent with the proposed rules, and with the lack of a requirement to disclose Scope 3\nemissions under the final rules, no registrants will be required to obtain assurance over Scope 3\nemissions under the final rules. Furthermore, as explained in greater detail below in section\nII.L.3, the final rules, including Item 1506, will not apply to a private company that is a party to a\n1197 See infra section II.O.3 for a detailed discussion of compliance dates for the final rules.\n1198 See 17 CFR 229.1506(a).\n1199 See 17 CFR 229.1505.

Similarly, studies of ESG-related assurance, which is\ntypically provided at a limited assurance level, have found benefits such as credibility\n1201 See supra note 1105 and accompanying text.\n1202 See supra note 1106 and accompanying text.\n1203 See Proposing Release, section II.H.1.\n1204 See Qualifications of Accountants, Release No. 33-10876 (Oct. 16, 2020) [85 FR 80508, 80508 (Dec. 22,\n2020)].

Casey, et al., Understanding and Contributing to the Enigma of Corporate Social\nResponsibility (CSR) Assurance in the United States, 34 Auditing: A Journal of Practice & Theory 97, 122\n(Feb. 2015) (finding that corporate social responsibility (\u201cCSR\u201d) assurance results in lower cost-of-capital\nalong with lower analyst forecast errors and dispersion, and that financial analysts find related CSR reports\nto be more credible when independently assured).

Current voluntary assurance practices have been varied and this\nfragmentation has diminished the comparability of assurance provided. Prescribing a minimum\nlevel of assurance required for AFs and LAFs over their Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions in the\nfinal rules, along with minimum requirements for the GHG emissions attestation provider and\nthe engagement, will enhance comparability and consistency with respect to assurance over\nGHG emissions disclosures.\nA few commenters stated that it is unnecessary to mandate assurance because there are\nexisting incentives for accuracy in connection with corporate disclosures, such as the\nCommission staff\u2019s filing review process or the possibility of Commission enforcement actions\nor private litigation.1213 While it is true that there are existing incentives for companies to\nprovide accurate information to investors, these incentives do not provide the same benefits that\nassurance will provide under the final rules. Although the desire to avoid an enforcement action\nor private litigation has a deterrent effect on registrants, such proceedings generally serve to\nadjudicate claims after investors have allegedly received inaccurate or misleading disclosures. In\ncontrast, the assurance requirement in the final rules will require an independent third-party to\nprovide a check on the accuracy and completeness of a registrant\u2019s GHG emissions disclosure\nbefore the information is provided to investors, which as explained above, will likely result in\nadditional benefits such as lower cost of equity capital and lower analyst forecast errors.1214\nFurthermore, although the Commission staff\u2019s filing review process serves a valuable\ncompliance function that contributes to investor protection, it is not designed to provide\nassurance, and certainly not for every filing. We note that, despite the existence and benefits of\n1213 See supra note 1119.\n1214 See supra note 1207.\n288\n\nthe filing review process, the Commission requires annual financial statements to be audited and\nhas adopted other rules requiring an expert to review and provide conclusions on other\nspecialized quantitative data that is provided outside of the financial statements to enhance its\nreliability.1215\nSeveral commenters raised concerns about registrants\u2019 ability to obtain assurance over\nGHG emissions disclosure in light of the level of judgment, estimation, or uncertainty that would\nbe involved in calculating GHG emissions data.1216 While we acknowledge these concerns, we\nnote that a number of registrants have voluntarily obtained either limited or reasonable assurance\nover their GHG emissions data, which shows that the practice is feasible.1217 And although there\nare differences between a financial statement audit and an assurance engagement over GHG\nemissions, registered public accounting firms regularly must provide assurance over financial\nstatement amounts that are subject to significant judgment, estimates, or assumptions or that rely\nupon information received from a third party. We acknowledge that auditing standards for\nfinancial statement audits are more established after decades of development and required use\n1215 See Modernization of Property Disclosures for Mining Registrants, Release No. 33-10570 (Oct. 31, 2018)\n[83 FR 66344 (Dec. 26, 2018)].

Nevertheless, as noted above, the\npractice of providing assurance over GHG emissions is far from nascent and is now expected by\nmany market participants.1218\nSeveral commenters urged the Commission to adopt the verification process for GHG\nreporting used by the EPA in lieu of the proposed assurance requirements.1219 Although we\nconsidered the EPA\u2019s multi-step verification process, given the differences in the Commission\u2019s\nand EPA\u2019s reporting requirements, the different purposes of the Commission\u2019s and EPA\u2019s\nrespective regulatory regimes, and the benefits of third-party assurance, we determined that\nindependent, third-party assurance is a more appropriate model for the final rules.1220\n1218 As discussed above, a number of jurisdictions have undertaken efforts to obtain more consistent,\ncomparable, and reliable climate-related information for investors, see supra section II.A.3, with certain\njurisdictions requiring the disclosure of GHG emissions data along with assurance.

See letter from EPA.\n2\n290\n\nSome commenters urged the Commission to wait before determining whether to adopt a\nmandatory attestation requirement for GHG emissions or to adopt final rules that permit\nregistrants to disclose whether they voluntarily obtained attestation and related details instead of\nmandating assurance.1221 We agree with commenters that requiring registrants to disclose\nwhether they obtained voluntary assurance and related details would help those investors that\ninvest in companies that decide to voluntarily obtain assurance understand whether the\nattestation obtained has enhanced the reliability of the GHG emissions disclosure, which is why\nwe have included a requirement in the final rules for registrants that are not subject to Item 1505\nto provide certain disclosure if they voluntarily obtain assurance over any voluntary GHG\nemissions disclosure included in Commission filings.1222 However, requiring AFs and LAFs to\nobtain assurance over their Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions disclosure in accordance with the\nfinal rules will result in more investors receiving the important benefits of assurance, including\nincreased confidence in the reliability of, and an improved ability to make informed investment\ndecisions based on, assured GHG emissions disclosures, which, as discussed above, provide\ninvestors with information for assessing a registrant\u2019s business, results of operations, and\nfinancial condition.1223 As discussed in greater detail below, the assurance requirements in the\nfinal rules are narrowly tailored and limited to a subset of registrants, many of which already\nobtain assurance services with respect to their GHG emissions disclosures. In addition, we\ndisagree with those commenters that suggested we wait before determining whether to adopt a\nmandatory attestation requirement for GHG emissions.1224 The phase in periods included in the\n1221 See supra notes 1131 and 1132 and accompanying text.\n1222 See infra section II.I.5.\n1223 See supra section II.H.3.a.\n1224 See supra note 1131 and accompanying text.\n291\n\nfinal rules should mitigate the concerns of commenters that stated the Commission should wait in\norder to give registrants and GHG emissions attestation providers more time to prepare for\nassurance, or to allow more time for attestation standards or guidance to develop.\nConsistent with the proposal, the final rules will apply the attestation requirements to AFs\nand LAFs.1225 However, in a shift from the proposal, the final rules will exempt SRCs and EGCs\nfrom the requirement to obtain an attestation report.1226 Although some commenters urged the\nCommission to apply the final rules to all registrants,1227 not just AFs and LAFs, our decision to\nexempt SRCs and EGCs from the assurance requirement is driven by our decision to exempt\nthese companies from the requirement to disclose GHG emissions, which is discussed in greater\ndetail above.1228 Since SRCs and EGCs will not be required to disclose GHG emissions, they\nalso will not be required to obtain assurance.\nUnder the final rules, AFs and LAFs will be required to obtain limited assurance over\ntheir GHG emissions disclosure beginning the third fiscal year after the compliance date for Item\n1505 (the GHG emissions disclosure provision).1229 LAFs will be required to obtain reasonable\nassurance over their GHG emissions disclosure beginning the seventh fiscal year after the\ncompliance date for Item 1505.1230 In a change from the proposal, AFs will not be required to\nscale up to reasonable assurance under the final rules. Although we agree with those\ncommenters that stated that reasonable assurance would provide investors with increased\n1225 See 17 CFR 229.1506(a).\n1226 SRCs and EGCs that qualified as AFs would have been included within the scope of AFs subject to the\nrequirement to obtain an attestation report under the proposed rules.\n1227 See supra note 1135 and accompanying text.\n1228 See supra section II.H.3.\n1229 See 17 CFR 229.1506(a)(1)(i), (ii).\n1230 See 17 CFR 229.1506(a)(1)(iii).\n292\n\nconfidence that a registrant\u2019s GHG emissions disclosure is reliable as compared to limited\nassurance,1231 we have determined that it is appropriate to apply the reasonable assurance\nrequirement to a more limited pool of registrants \u2013 LAFs \u2013 at this time because some LAFs are\nalready collecting and disclosing climate-related information, including GHG emissions data,1232\nand larger issuers generally bear proportionately lower compliance costs than smaller issuers due\nto the fixed cost components of such compliance. This scaled approach will avoid increasing\ncompliance burdens for AFs that may be smaller or less sophisticated issuers.\nWe considered whether to require LAFs to obtain an attestation report at a reasonable\nassurance level from the start as suggested by some commenters.1233 However, most registrants\nthat are voluntarily obtaining assurance today obtain limited assurance rather than reasonable\nassurance,1234 and therefore a transition period is appropriate to give LAFs and GHG emissions\nattestation providers time to prepare for the higher level of assurance. In contrast to some\ncommenters\u2019 suggestion that obtaining reasonable assurance would be impractical,1235 we note\nthat some registrants have voluntarily obtained reasonable assurance over their GHG emissions\ndisclosure.1236 In addition, one commenter stated that it agreed with the Commission\u2019s statement\n1231 See, e.g., letter from GRI.\n1232 According to one study, 99% of S&P 500 companies reported ESG information in 2021 and 65% of such\ncompanies reported obtaining assurance over some ESG information. See CAQ, S&P 500 and ESG\nReporting (updated June 2023), available at https://www.thecaq.org/sp-500-and-esg-reporting. In addition,\naccording to the study, over 63% of S&P 500 companies reported obtaining assurance specifically over\nsome portion of their GHG emissions disclosures. See id. Based on an analysis by Commission staff on\nFeb. 29, 2024, a substantial number of the S&P 500 companies (494) are LAFs.\n1233 See supra note 1145 and accompanying text.\n1234 See CAQ, S&P 500 and ESG Reporting (Updated June 2023), available at https://www.thecaq.org/sp-500-\nand-esg-reporting (stating that in 2021 most companies that obtained assurance from public company\nauditors and other providers opted for limited assurance).\n1235 See, e.g., letter from INGAA.\n1236 See supra note 1217.\n293\n\nin the Proposing Release that limited assurance is not possible unless the assurance provider also\nbelieves reasonable assurance is possible on the subject matter.1237\nWe recognize that obtaining reasonable assurance over GHG emissions disclosure will be\nmore costly than obtaining limited assurance because the scope of work in a limited assurance\nengagement is substantially less than the scope of work in a reasonable assurance engagement.\nThe primary difference between the two levels of assurance relates to the nature, timing, and\nextent of procedures required to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to support the limited\nassurance conclusion or reasonable assurance opinion. For example, in a limited assurance\nengagement, the procedures performed by attestation providers are generally limited to analytical\nprocedures and inquiries,1238 but in a reasonable assurance engagement, they are also required to\nperform risk assessment and detail testing procedures to respond to the assessed risk.1239\nHowever, the outcome of a reasonable assurance engagement results in positive assurance (e.g.,\nthe provider forms an opinion about whether the registrant\u2019s GHG emissions disclosures are in\naccordance with Item 1505 in all material respects) while the outcome of a limited assurance\nengagement results in negative assurance (e.g., the provider forms a conclusion about whether it\nis aware of any material modifications that should be made to the disclosures for it to be in\naccordance with Item 1505). Therefore, we agree with those commenters that stated reasonable\n1237 See letter from ERM CVS. As the Commission explained in the Proposing Release, under commonly used\nattestation standards, both a reasonable assurance engagement and a limited assurance engagement have the\nsame requirement that the subject matter (e.g., Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions) of the engagement be\nappropriate as a precondition for providing assurance. Thus, if the subject matter is appropriate for a\nlimited assurance engagement, it is also appropriate for a reasonable assurance engagement. See Proposing\nRelease, section II.H.1 See also, e.g., AICPA SSAE No. 18, Attestation Standards, available at\nhttps://us.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/research/standards/auditattest/downloadabledocuments/ssae-no-\n18.pdf; and IAASB ISAE 3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of\nHistorical Financial Information, available at https://www.ifac.org/_flysystem/azure-\nprivate/publications/files/ISAE%203000%20Revised%20-%20for%20IAASB.pdf.\n1238 See, e.g., AICPA SSAE No. 18, AT-C \u00a7 105.A14.\n1239 See, e.g., AICPA SSAE No. 18, AT-C \u00a7 205.18.\n294\n\nassurance will provide greater value to investors because at the reasonable assurance level,\ninvestors receive more reliable information about GHG emissions.1240 Registrants may also\nbenefit from providing disclosures subject to a reasonable assurance level because such\nassurance enhances investor confidence in the disclosures, and as a result, may lower the cost of\ncapital for registrants.1241\nAs explained above, LAFs are best positioned to bear the increased costs of obtaining\nreasonable assurance. Such costs are justified for these registrants by the benefits that investors\nand registrants will receive in the form of positive assurance, which makes it more likely that\nmaterial errors or omissions are detected and is consistent with the Commission\u2019s investor\nprotection mission. In light of the significant phased in compliance period that LAFs will have\nbefore reasonable assurance is required, we expect that registrants will incur these costs over\nseveral years, which should make the burden easier to bear in any particular year. We also\nexpect that during the significant phased in compliance period new assurance providers will\nenter the market and any resulting increase in competition will lead to relative reductions in the\ncosts of providing those services over time.1242\nWe considered whether it would be appropriate to wait to make a determination about\nwhether LAFs should be required to scale up to reasonable assurance, but decided against such\n1240 See supra note 1145 and accompanying text.\n1241 See letter from Anthesis Grp. See also supra note 1207.\n1242 See letter from Futurepast (expressing the view that the existence of a larger pool of potential GHG\nemissions attestation providers will enhance competition and likely result in lower costs to registrants). In\naddition, as discussed in greater detail below in Sections II.I.2.c and 3.c., we expect that registrants\u2019 ability\nto hire a non-accounting firm as a GHG emissions attestation provider and our decision to make certain\nmodifications to the proposed requirements applicable to the GHG emissions attestation engagement\nshould help address concerns about the supply of GHG emissions attestation providers.\n295\n\nan approach because the benefits of obtaining reasonable assurance are apparent now1243 and we\ndo not expect those to change in the future, while our decision to limit the reasonable assurance\nrequirement to a narrower scope of registrants and to provide a significant transition period will\nhelp address the concerns raised by commenters. We also considered the suggestion by one\ncommenter that the Commission initially require registrants to obtain reasonable assurance,\nfollowed by limited assurance engagements to the extent the first year\u2019s attestation report\nincluded no qualifications; however, for the reasons stated above, the scaled approach, starting\nwith limited assurance and subsequently moving to reasonable assurance, will allow LAFs time\nfor their processes and controls to mature before being subject to the higher level of assurance. It\nwill also provide attestation service providers that do not currently provide assurance over GHG\nemissions disclosure with additional time to familiarize themselves with providing assurance\nover such disclosure, which, as noted above, should facilitate additional competition between\nassurance providers and further help decrease costs of compliance.\nA number of commenters recommended that the Commission extend the phase in periods\nin the final rules because the proposed compliance schedule would have been too challenging for\nregistrants to meet.1244 We agree with commenters that extending the phase in periods would\nprovide registrants and GHG emissions attestation providers with additional time to prepare for\nimplementation of the rules and would allow assurance standards and practices applicable to\n1243 See supra note 1193; Brandon Gipper, et al., Carbon Accounting Quality: Measurement and the Role of\nAssurance (Nov. 2023), available at https://ssrn.com/abstract=4627783 (concluding that reasonable\nassurance improves carbon accounting quality more than limited assurance). See also letters from GRI\n(\u201cReasonable assurance should be adopted as this would be commensurate with the level of assurance\nprovided through statutory audits of financial statements and will give information users increased\nconfidence that the reported information is prepared in accordance with stated criteria.\u201d); and PWYP\n(\u201cGiven the importance of GHG emissions data to enable investors to fully understand the climate-related\nrisks of issuers, reasonable assurance is necessary to ensure that information is subjected to sufficient\nexamination and verification such that it can be relied on by investors.\u201d).\n1244 See supra note 1166 and accompanying text.\n296\n\nGHG emissions to further evolve while balancing investors\u2019 need for the information.\nTherefore, as compared to the proposal, the final rules provide AFs and LAFs with additional\ntime before they are required to comply with the GHG emissions assurance requirements in\naddition to the phased in GHG emissions compliance dates.1245 Providing two phased in\ncompliance dates\u2014one before registrants are required to comply with the GHG emissions\ndisclosure requirements and another before registrants are required to comply with the assurance\nrequirements\u2014will allow registrants and assurance providers to gain experience with the new\nrules before assurance is required.\nCommenters expressed a variety of views about whether the Commission should define\nthe terms \u201climited assurance\u201d and \u201creasonable assurance\u201d in the final rules. Some commenters\nstated that definitions or guidance could be helpful or reduce any potential confusion,1246 while\nother commenters stated that no definition is needed.1247 We have determined not to include\ndefinitions of \u201climited assurance\u201d and \u201creasonable assurance\u201d in the final rules because we agree\nwith the commenters that stated that this terminology is generally well understood1248 and should\nbe defined by assurance standard setters and not by the Commission.1249 As we explained in the\nProposing Release, \u201climited assurance\u201d and \u201creasonable assurance\u201d are currently defined by the\nprevailing attestation standards.1250 Furthermore, we expect the description of the work\nperformed as a basis for the assurance provider\u2019s conclusion on the GHG emissions attestation\n1245 See 17 CFR 229.1506(a). See also infra section II.O.3 for further discussion of the compliance dates for\nthe final rules.\n1246 See supra note 1180 and accompanying text.\n1247 See supra note 1183 and accompanying text.\n1248 See letter from CFA Institute.\n1249 See letter from Mazars.\n1250 See Proposing Release, section II.H.1. See also, e.g., AICPA SSAE No. 18, AT-C \u00a7 105.10 and IAASB\nISAE 3000 (Revised) \u00a7 12(a)(i).\n297\n\nengagement to be included in any assurance report issued pursuant to the final rules, which\nshould facilitate investors\u2019 understanding of the nature of the limited or reasonable assurance\nengagement.1251\nOne commenter asked the Commission to clarify how the terms \u201climited assurance\u201d and\n\u201creasonable assurance\u201d relate to the \u201cstandard GHG terms of \u2018measured,\u2019 \u2018monitored,\u2019 and\n\u2018verified.\u2019\u201d1252 It is our general understanding that \u201cmeasured,\u201d \u201cmonitored,\u201d and \u201cverified\u201d are\nterms commonly used in the marketplace to describe the process for calculating and reporting\nGHG emissions data.1253 Although such a process could share some similarities with the steps\nGHG emission attestation providers undertake during the course of an assurance engagement,\nsuch a process is distinct from the assurance required by the final rules, which must be\nperformed in accordance with a standard that meets the requirements detailed below. Another\ncommenter urged the Commission to provide a definition of limited assurance that establishes \u201ca\nprocess more rigorous than currently used for assurance of quarterly SEC filings.\u201d1254 However,\ndoing so would potentially result in the Commission\u2019s definition of limited assurance being\ndifferent from, or conflicting with, the definitions included in the prevailing attestation standards\nthat we expect many GHG emissions attestation providers will use, which could cause confusion.\n1251 See, e.g., IAASB ISAE 3000 (Revised) \u00a7 69(k).\n1252 See letter from IECA.\n1253 For example, the draft interagency report entitled, \u201cFederal Strategy to Advance Greenhouse Gas\nMeasurement and Monitoring for the Agriculture and Forest Sectors (Strategy),\u201d states that \u201cMeasurement,\nMonitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MMRV) refers to activities undertaken to quantify GHG\nemissions and sinks (through direct measurement and/or modeling), monitor emission over time, verify\nestimates, and synthesize and report on findings.\u201d See Federal Strategy to Advance Measurement and\nMonitoring Greenhouse Gas Measurement and Monitoring for the Agriculture and Forest Sectors, 88 FR\n44251 (July 12, 2023).\n1254 See supra note 1180.\n298\n\nAs discussed above, the final rules provide that any GHG emissions metrics required to\nbe disclosed pursuant to Item 1505 in an annual report filed with the Commission on Form 10-K\nmay be incorporated by reference from the registrant\u2019s Form 10-Q for the second fiscal quarter\nin the fiscal year immediately following the year to which the GHG emissions disclosure relates,\nor may be included in an amended annual report on Form 10-K no later than the due date for\nsuch Form 10-Q.1255 The extension of the deadline for the filing of GHG emissions metrics also\napplies to the deadline for the filing of an attestation report, which should accompany the GHG\nemissions disclosure to which the report applies.1256 This additional time\u2014an additional two\nfiscal quarters\u2014should provide registrants subject to Item 1505 and their GHG emissions\nattestation providers with sufficient time to measure GHG emissions, provide assurance, and\nprepare the required attestation report. Consistent with the notice requirements included in Item\n1505(c), the final rules (Item 1506(f)) provide that a registrant that elects to incorporate by\nreference its attestation report from its Form 10-Q for the second fiscal quarter or to provide its\nattestation report in an amended annual report must include an express statement in its annual\nreport indicating its intention to either incorporate by reference the attestation report from a\nquarterly report on Form 10-Q or amend its annual report to provide the attestation report by the\ndue date specified in Item 1505.1257\n1255 See 17 CFR 220.1505(c)(1). If the registrant is a foreign private issuer, the final rules provide that its GHG\nemissions disclosure may be included in an amendment to its annual report on Form 20-F, which shall be\ndue no later than 225 days after the end of the fiscal year to which the GHG emissions disclosure relates.\nSee id. See also supra section II.H.3.\n1256 See 17 CFR 229.1506(f).\n1257 See id.\n299\n\nThe proposed rules would have required the attestation report to be included in the\nseparately captioned \u201cClimate-Related Disclosure\u201d section in the relevant filing.1258 However,\nas discussed above, the final rules leave the placement of climate-related disclosures, other than\nthe financial statement disclosures, largely up to each registrant.1259 As such, a registrant will\nnot be required to include the attestation report in a separately captioned \u201cClimate-Related\nDisclosure\u201d section, although it may elect to do so.1260\nConsistent with the proposed rules, during the phased in compliance period when limited\nassurance is required for LAFs, the final rules (Item 1506(a)(1)(ii)) permit an LAF, at its option,\nto obtain reasonable assurance of its Scope 1 and/or 2 emissions disclosure.1261 Similarly, the\nfinal rules (Item 1506(a)(1)(i)) permit an AF, at its option, to obtain reasonable assurance of its\nScope 1 and/or 2 emissions disclosure. In addition, at its option, a registrant that is subject to the\nassurance requirements would be able to obtain any level of assurance over its GHG emissions\ndisclosures that are not required to be assured pursuant to Item 1506(a).1262 For filings made\nafter the compliance date for the GHG emissions disclosure requirements but before Item\n1506(a) requires limited assurance, a registrant would only be required to provide the disclosure\ncalled for by Item 1506(e).1263 For filings made after the compliance date for assurance required\nby Item 1506(a), to avoid potential confusion, the additional, voluntary assurance obtained by\n1258 See Proposing Release, section II.H.3.\n1259 See supra section II.A.3.\n1260 See id. for further discussion of presentation requirements for GHG emissions disclosure under the final\nrules.\n1261 See Proposing Release, section II.H.1.\n1262 Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions disclosures are required to be assured pursuant to Item 1506(a). As\nnoted above, no registrants are required to provide Scope 3 GHG emissions disclosures; however, a\nregistrant may choose to provide such disclosure voluntarily.\n1263 See 17 CFR 229.1506(a)(3).\n300\n\nsuch filer would be required to follow the requirements of Items 1506(b) through (d), including\nusing the same attestation standard as the required assurance over Scope 1 and/or Scope 2\nemissions, which was supported by one commenter.1264 Although in the Proposing Release, the\nrequirements outlined in this paragraph would have applied to any climate-related disclosures not\nsubject to assurance under Item 1506(a),1265 we have narrowed the scope of the final rule to\napply only to GHG emissions disclosures that are not required to be assured under Item 1506(a)\nbecause, given the modifications in the final rule, we think it is unlikely that registrants will\nvoluntarily obtain assurance over non-GHG emissions disclosure for which the disclosure\nrequired by 1506(e) would be useful to investors.1266 Therefore, to reduce the complexity of the\nfinal rules, we are streamlining it in this way. In addition, as discussed below in section II.I.5, a\nregistrant that is not subject to Item 1505 but that voluntarily discloses GHG emissions\ninformation and voluntarily obtains assurance will be required to comply only with Item 1506(e),\nif applicable.\nFor ease of reference, we have included a table reflecting the application of these\nrequirements:\n1264 See letter from Amer. for Fin. Reform, Sunrise Project et al.; 17 CFR 229.1506(a)(3). For example, if an\nLAF was required to obtain reasonable assurance over its Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions disclosure and\nthe attestation provider chose to follow, for example, the AICPA attestation standards, the LAF could\nvoluntarily obtain limited assurance over any voluntary Scope 3 GHG emissions disclosure, and the\nattestation provider would be required to follow the AICPA\u2019s attestation standard for providing limited\nassurance.\n1265 See Proposing Release, section II.H.1.\n1266 See 17 CFR 229.1506(a)(3).\n301\n\nAfter the Compliance Date for After the Compliance Date\nGHG Emissions Disclosure but for Assurance\nbefore the Compliance Date for\nAssurance\nLAFs and AFs subject to Items Any voluntary assurance over any Any voluntary assurance\n1505 and 1506(a) through (d) GHG emissions disclosure must obtained over GHG emissions\n(e.g., registrants that are comply with the disclosure disclosures that are not\nrequired to disclose GHG requirements in Item 1506(e). required to be assured\nemissions and obtain assurance) pursuant to Item 1506(a) (e.g.,\nvoluntary Scope 3\ndisclosures) must follow the\nrequirements of Item 1506(b)\nthrough (d), including using\nthe same attestation standard\nas the registrant\u2019s required\nassurance over Scope 1 and/or\nScope 2 disclosure.\nRegistrants not subject to Items Any voluntary assurance over any Any voluntary assurance over\n1505 or 1506(a) through (d) (e.g., GHG emissions disclosure must any GHG emissions\nregistrants that are not required comply with the disclosure disclosure must comply with\nto disclose GHG emissions) requirements in Item 1506(e) the disclosure requirements in\nItem 1506(e).\n2. GHG Emissions Attestation Provider Requirements\na. Proposed Rules\nThe proposed rules would have required the GHG emissions attestation report required\nby proposed Item 1505(a) for AFs and LAFs to be prepared and signed by a GHG emissions\n302\n\nattestation provider.1267 The proposed rules would have defined a GHG emissions attestation\nprovider to mean a person or firm that has all the following characteristics:\n\u2022 Is an expert in GHG emissions by virtue of having significant experience in measuring,\nanalyzing, reporting, or attesting to GHG emissions. Significant experience means\nhaving sufficient competence and capabilities necessary to:\nPerform engagements in accordance with professional standards and applicable\no\nlegal and regulatory requirements; and\nEnable the service provider to issue reports that are appropriate under the\no\ncircumstances.\n\u2022 Is independent with respect to the registrant, and any of its affiliates,1268 for whom it is\nproviding the attestation report, during the attestation and professional engagement\nperiod.1269\nThe Commission explained that the proposed expertise requirement was intended to help\nensure that the service provider preparing the attestation report has sufficient competence and\ncapabilities necessary to execute the attestation requirement.1270 If the service provider is a firm,\nthe Commission stated it would expect that the firm has policies and procedures designed to\nprovide it with reasonable assurance that the personnel selected to conduct the GHG emissions\n1267 See Proposing Release, section II.H.2.\n1268 See id. Proposed Item 1505(b)(2)(iii) stated that the term \u201caffiliates\u201d has the meaning provided in 17 CFR\n210.2-01, except that references to \u201caudit\u201d are deemed to be references to the attestation services provided\npursuant to this section.\n1269 See Proposing Release, section II.H.2. Proposed Item 1505(b)(2)(iv) stated that the term \u201cattestation and\nprofessional engagement period\u201d means the period covered by the attestation report and the period of the\nengagement to attest to the registrant\u2019s GHG emissions or to prepare a report filed with the Commission.\nThe professional engagement period begins when the GHG attestation service provider either signs an\ninitial engagement letter (or other agreement to attest a registrant\u2019s GHG emissions) or begins attest\nprocedures, whichever is earlier.\n1270 See Proposing Release, Section II.H.2. `\n303\n\nattestation engagement have sufficient experience with respect to both attestation engagements\nand GHG disclosure. This would mean that the service provider has the qualifications necessary\nfor fulfillment of the responsibilities that it would be called on to assume, including the\nappropriate engagement of specialists, if needed.1271 The Commission explained that the\nproposed expertise requirement would have applied to the person or the firm signing the GHG\nemissions attestation report.1272\nThe proposed requirement related to independence was modeled on the Commission\u2019s\nqualifications for accountants under 17 CFR 210.2-01 (\u201cRule 2-01 of Regulation S-X\u201d), which\nare designed to ensure that auditors are independent of their audit clients.1273 The Commission\nexplained that similar to how assurance provided by independent public accountants improves\nthe reliability of the financial statements and disclosures and is a critical component of our\ncapital markets, assurance of GHG emissions disclosure by independent service providers should\nalso improve the reliability of such disclosure.1274 The Commission stated that academic studies\ndemonstrate that assurance provided by an independent auditor reduces the risk that an entity\nprovides materially inaccurate information to external parties, including investors, by facilitating\nthe dissemination of transparent and reliable financial information.1275 The Commission\n1271 See id.\n1272 See id. The Commission noted that it has adopted similar expertise requirements in the past to determine\neligibility to prepare a mining technical report, although the mining technical report requirements differ in\nthat such an engagement is not an assurance engagement. See id. (citing Modernization of Property\nDisclosures for Mining Registrants, Release No. 33-10570 (Oct. 31, 2018) [83 FR 66344 (Dec. 26, 2018)]).\n1273 See Proposing Release, section II.H.2.\n1274 See id.\n1275 See id.\n304\n\nexplained that it expected that GHG emissions disclosure would similarly benefit if assured by\nan independent service provider.1276\nSimilar to Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X,1277 the proposed rules provided that a GHG\nemissions attestation provider is not independent if, during the attestation and professional\nengagement period, such attestation provider is not, or a reasonable investor with knowledge of\nall relevant facts and circumstances would conclude that such attestation provider is not, capable\nof exercising objective and impartial judgment on all issues encompassed within the attestation\nprovider\u2019s engagement.1278 The proposed rules further stated that, in determining whether a\nGHG emissions attestation provider is independent the Commission would consider:\n\u2022 Whether a relationship or the provision of a service creates a mutual or conflicting\ninterest between the attestation provider and the registrant (or any of its affiliates),\nplaces the attestation provider in the position of attesting to such attestation provider\u2019s\nown work, results in the attestation provider acting as management or an employee of\nthe registrant (or any of its affiliates), or places the attestation provider in a position\nof being an advocate for the registrant (or any of its affiliates); and\n\u2022 All relevant circumstances, including all financial or other relationships between the\nattestation provider and the registrant (or any of its affiliates), and not just those\nrelating to reports filed with the Commission.1279\n1276 See id.\n1277 See 17 CFR 210.2-01(b).\n1278 See Proposing Release, section II.H.2.\n1279 See id.\n305\n\nThese proposed provisions were modeled on the factors used by the Commission in\ndetermining whether an accountant is independent.1280 The Commission explained that similar\nto Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X, the proposed provisions should help protect investors by\nrequiring the GHG emissions attestation provider to be independent both in fact and appearance\nfrom the registrant, including its affiliates.1281\nThe Commission also explained that because the GHG emissions attestation provider\nwould be a person whose profession gives authority to the statements made in the attestation\nreport and who is named as having provided an attestation report that is part of the registration\nstatement, the registrant would be required to obtain and include the written consent of the GHG\nemissions attestation provider pursuant to Securities Act section 7,1282 the corresponding rule\nrequiring the written consents of such experts,1283 and the Regulation S-K provision requiring the\nattachment of the written consent of an expert to a Securities Act registration statement or\nExchange Act report that incorporates by reference a written expert report attached to a\npreviously filed Securities Act registration statement.1284 The GHG emissions attestation\nprovider would also be subject to liability under the Federal securities laws for the attestation\nconclusion or, when applicable, opinion provided.1285 The Commission explained that such\n1280 See 17 CFR 210.2-01. For the avoidance of doubt, the Commission noted that if the independent\naccountant who audits the registrant\u2019s consolidated financial statements is also engaged to perform the\nGHG emissions attestation for the same filing, the fees associated with the GHG emissions attestation\nengagement would be considered \u201cAudit-Related Fees\u201d for purposes of Item 9(e) of 17 CFR 240.14a-101,\nItem 14 of Form 10-K, Item 16C of Form 20-F, or any similar requirements.

See also 17 CFR 229.601(b)(23).\n1285 As explained above, a limited assurance engagement results in a conclusion that no material modification is\nneeded and a reasonable assurance engagement results in an opinion.

Comments\nA number of commenters supported the proposed rules\u2019 requirement for a registrant to\nobtain a GHG emissions attestation report that is provided by a GHG emissions attestation\nprovider that meets specified requirements.1287 A number of commenters stated that they agreed\nwith the approach taken in the proposed rules not to limit eligible GHG emissions attestation\nproviders to only accounting firms.1288 Several commenters stated that non-accounting firms\nmay have expertise that would be relevant to providing assurance over GHG emissions\ndisclosure.1289 For example, one commenter stated that \u201ccertain situations may require specialist\nexpertise and that limiting attestation providers only to accounting firms would prevent\nregistrants in such situations from availing themselves of the requisite special knowledge.\u201d1290\nAnother commenter stated that \u201c[e]xpanding assurance beyond accounting firms has the added\nbenefit of providing a much larger pool of assurance providers, which could potentially lower\n1286 See Proposing Release, section II.H.2.\n1287 See, e.g., letters from BOA; Bureau Veritas; CII; Crowe; ERM CVS; Ernst & Young LLP; Futurepast;\nICAEW (\u201cThird party assurance providers should comply with a professional framework encompassing\ncompetence, independence and a system of quality management.\u201d); ICI; LRQA; MFA; Morningstar; and\nTotalEnergies.\n1288 See letter from ABA; Beller et al.; Bureau Veritas; Ceres; CFA Institute; Chevron; Climate Risk Consortia;\nERM; Futurepast; J.

Reform, Sunrise Project et al. (\u201cEligible attestation providers should not be\nlimited to only PCAOB-registered audit firms, but the SEC will need to conduct enhanced monitoring and\nenforcement of the assurance, as the attesting entities will be neither inspected by the PCAOB nor subject\nto PCAOB standards and enforcement.\u201d); Center Amer.

Final Rules (Item 1506(b))\nWe are adopting the GHG emissions attestation provider requirements substantially as\nproposed.1348 We continue to believe that the expertise requirements (Item 1506(b)(1)) are\nnecessary to help ensure that the service provider preparing the attestation report has sufficient\ncompetence and capabilities necessary to execute the attestation engagement.1349 Several\ncommenters agreed with the proposal\u2019s expertise requirements and definition of significant\nexperience.1350 While some commenters urged the Commission to require a GHG emissions\nattestation provider to have a certain number of years of experience,1351 other commenters stated\nthat the Commission should not prescribe a minimum number of years.1352 We do not think it is\nnecessary to require a provider to have a certain number of years of experience because imposing\nsuch a requirement could result in a \u201ccheck the box\u201d mentality, and we believe that investors\n1346 See, e.g., letters from BPI; and Financial Services Forum.\n1347 See letter from BPI.\n1348 See 17 CFR 229.1506(b). To enhance clarity, we are making one minor change to the rule text. In the\ndefinition of \u201csignificant experience\u201d in the final rules, we are substituting the proposed rule\u2019s reference to\n\u201cprofessional standards\u201d with a reference to \u201cattestation standards\u201d to make it clear that the standards being\nreferenced in Item 1506(b)(1)(i) are the attestation standards that meet the requirements of Item 1506(a).\nSee 17 CFR 229.1506(b)(1)(i).\n1349 See Proposing Release, section II.H.2.\n1350 See supra notes 1287 and 1297 and accompanying text.\n1351 See supra note 1298 and accompanying text.\n1352 See supra note 1299 and accompanying text.\n318\n\nwould be better served by registrants undertaking a more holistic consideration of a provider\u2019s\nqualifications in selecting a provider. Some commenters requested that the Commission provide\nadditional guidance regarding the qualifications for a GHG emissions attestation provider;1353\nhowever, these commenters generally did not identify any particular aspects of the expertise\nrequirement that required clarification. Adopting a principles-based approach inherently\ninvolves some uncertainty, but we believe registrants would be better served by such flexibility\nthan an approach that, for example, identifies a static list of qualified providers. Such an\napproach will provide a registrant with more leeway to select a GHG emissions attestation\nprovider that has the experience that best fits the registrant\u2019s facts and circumstances, which\ncould improve the quality of assurance provided thereby enhancing the reliability of GHG\nemissions disclosures.\nIn response to a question included in the Proposing Release, some commenters stated that\nthe Commission should specify that a GHG emissions attestation provider meets the expertise\nrequirements if it is a member in good standing of a specified accreditation body and identified\nparticular bodies or approaches the Commission should consider.1354 We have decided not to\nimpose such a requirement at this time given the evolving nature of GHG emissions assurance\nand the possibility that new or different accreditation bodies may exist at the time when\nregistrants subject to Item 1505 and Item 1506 are required to begin obtaining attestation reports.\nSeveral commenters recommended that the Commission specify additional qualifications for\nGHG emissions attestation providers,1355 and while we considered each of these suggestions, we\n1353 See supra notes 1300 and 1301 and accompanying text.\n1354 See supra notes 1305, 1307, and 1308 and accompanying text.\n1355 See supra note 1312 and accompanying text.\n319\n\nbelieve that the requirements we have included in the final rules will help ensure that GHG\nemissions attestation providers have sufficient competence and capabilities necessary to execute\nthe attestation engagement.\nWhile a number of commenters urged the Commission to require that a GHG emissions\nattestation provider be a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB,1356 we determined\nto retain the principles-based approach in the final rules because it will provide registrants with\nthe flexibility to hire a non-accounting firm that may have relevant or specialized experience\nwith respect to assuring GHG emissions disclosure while at the same time ensuring that a GHG\nemissions attestation provider has the requisite expertise to perform the engagement in\naccordance with professional standards. Although we agree there would be investor protection\nbenefits to be gained by requiring a registrant to use a PCAOB-regulated entity that is subject to\noversight and inspections (even though the PCAOB\u2019s inspection jurisdiction would not include\nengagements for the assurance of GHG emissions disclosure within its scope),1357 we have\nbalanced this against other considerations, such as the availability of GHG emissions providers\nand compliance costs, which could potentially be lower if a larger pool of assurance providers is\navailable. Nevertheless, we agree with those commenters who stated that if the final rules permit\nnon-PCAOB-registered accounting firms to provide attestation services, the Commission would\nneed to ensure that there are appropriate protections in place for investors.1358 The expertise,\n1356 See supra note 1294 and accompanying text.\n1357 The PCAOB\u2019s inspection jurisdiction is limited to audits of issuers, brokers, and dealers and would not\ninclude engagements for the assurance of GHG emissions disclosure within its scope. See 15 U.S.C. 7214\n(setting forth the PCAOB\u2019s inspection jurisdiction). However, as discussed in greater detail below,\noversight inspection programs can provide benefits, such as providing a check on a GHG emissions\nattestation provider\u2019s overall activities and driving improvements in the quality of services overall, even\nwhen an oversight inspection program does not include a GHG emissions attestation engagement within its\nscope.\n1358 See supra note 1292 and accompanying text.\n320\n\nindependence, and other requirements applicable to the GHG emissions attestation engagement\nunder the final rules, such as the requirement for a provider to use attestation standards that are\nestablished by a body or group that has followed due process procedures, are intended to serve\nprecisely that function.\nAs with the proposed rules, the final rules apply the expertise requirement to the person\nor firm signing the GHG emissions attestation report.1359 If the service provider is a firm, we\nwould expect it to have policies and procedures designed to provide it with reasonable assurance\nthat the personnel selected to conduct the GHG emissions attestation engagement have\nsignificant experience with respect to both attestation engagements and GHG emissions. As we\nexplained in the Proposing Release, this would mean that the service provider has the\nqualifications necessary for fulfillment of the responsibilities that it would be called on to\nassume, including the appropriate engagement of specialists, if needed.1360 A few commenters\nsupported a requirement for GHG emissions attestation providers to establish policies and\nprocedures along these lines.1361 Although, as stated above, we expect firms to adopt policies\nand procedures related to the expertise of its personnel, we have determined not to include such a\nrequirement in the final rules because we do not want to foreclose other possible means by which\na firm may ensure that it and its relevant personnel meet the expertise requirements set forth in\nItem 1506(b).\nAs noted above, one commenter recommended that the Commission consider whether\nstate licensure laws would preclude parties other than CPAs from performing attestation\n1359 See 17 CFR 229.1506(b).\n1360 See Proposing Release, section II.H.2.\n1361 See supra note 1315 and accompanying text.\n321\n\nservices.1362 It is our understanding that states typically require someone who holds itself out as\na public accountant or as performing public accounting services to be licensed as a CPA. In\naddition, non-CPAs are not able to use the AICPA or PCAOB attestation standards.1363\nHowever, these principles would not prevent a non-CPA from performing attestation services as\nlong as it was neither holding itself out as a CPA nor using an attestation standard that, by its\nterms, is only available to CPAs. In this regard, we note that the IAASB and ISO standards, two\nof the four standards we are explicitly permitting assurance providers to use under the final rules\n(as discussed in more detail below), are not restricted to CPAs, and we are not aware that any\nstate laws are currently impacting the ability of non-CPA service providers to provide assurance\nover GHG emissions.\nWith respect to independence, we are adopting each of the independence requirements\n(Item 1506(b)(2)) as proposed.1364 These independence requirements are important because they\nhelp ensure that the attestation provider will perform the engagement in an objective and\nimpartial manner. A number of commenters agreed with the proposed requirement for a GHG\nemissions attestation provider to be independent with respect to the registrant and any of its\naffiliates and agreed that the independence requirement would enhance the reliability of the\n1362 See letter from PwC. See also letter from NASBA (\u201cVirtually all of the State Boards do not allow non-\nCPAs to perform attestation services or issue reports under the professional standards governing the public\naccounting profession.\u201d).\n1363 By their terms, AICPA and PCAOB attestation standards are only applicable in the context of engagements\nperformed by certified public accountants. See, e.g., PCAOB AT section 101, Attest Engagements,\navailable at https://pcaobus.org/oversight/standards/attestation-standards/details/AT101 (stating that \u201c[t]his\nsection applies to engagements . . . in which a certified public accountant in the practice of public\naccounting . . . is engaged to issue or does issue an examination, a review, or an agreed-upon procedures\nreport on subject matter . . .\u201d) (emphasis added); AICPA SSAE No. 18, AT-C \u00a7 105.01 (\u201cThis section\napplies to engagements in which a CPA in the practice of public accounting is engaged to issue, or does\nissue, a practitioner\u2019s examination, review, or agreed-upon procedures report on subject matter or an\nassertion about subject matter (hereinafter referred to as an assertion) that is the responsibility of another\nparty.\u201d) (emphasis added).\n1364 See 17 CFR 229.1506(b)(2).\n322\n\nattestation report.1365 We continue to believe that, similar to how assurance provided by\nindependent public accountants improves the reliability of financial statements and disclosures\nand is a critical component of our capital markets, assurance of GHG emissions disclosure by\nindependent service providers should also improve the reliability of such disclosure.1366 Several\ncommenters agreed with the Commission\u2019s proposed approach of modeling the independence\nrequirement and relevant definitions on the Commission\u2019s qualifications for accountants under\nRule 2-01 of Regulation S-X,1367 and we continue to believe the approach is appropriate given\nour experience in administering Rule 2-01 in the context of financial statement audits. One\ncommenter appeared to suggest that, under the proposed rules, GHG emissions attestation\nproviders would not be subject to the same level of independence as financial statement\nauditors.1368 Although the final rules do not set forth a non-exclusive specification of\ncircumstances inconsistent with independence like Rule 2-01(c) does for financial statement\nauditors, the foundational principles underlying the independence requirements in Rule 2-01 and\nthe final rules are the same,1369 and we view the independence requirements in the two contexts\nas providing similar, if not equivalent, protections to investors. However, for the avoidance of\nany doubt, we are clarifying that registrants and GHG emissions attestation providers are only\n1365 See supra note 1317 and accompanying text.\n1366 See Proposing Release, section II.H.2.\n1367 See supra notes 1321 and 1324 and accompanying text.\n1368 See letter from PwC.\n1369 Namely, the final rules provide that a GHG emissions attestation provider is not independent if such\nattestation provider is not, or a reasonable investor with knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances\nwould conclude that such attestation provider is not, capable of exercising objective and impartial judgment\non all issues encompassed within the attestation provider\u2019s engagement, which is modeled on Rule 2-01(b).\nCompare 17 CFR 229.1506(b)(2)(i) and 17 CFR 210.2-01(b). Also, the final rules model the factors the\nCommission will consider in determining whether a GHG emissions attestation provider is independent on\nthe introductory text to Rule 2-01. Compare 17 CFR 229.1506(b)(2)(ii) and Introductory Text to Rule 2-\n01.\n323\n\nrequired to comply with the independence requirements included in Item 1506 and are not\nrequired to separately comply with the independence requirements included in Rule 2-01 with\nrespect to the GHG emissions attestation engagement.1370 Along those lines, existing\nCommission guidance and staff interpretations regarding Rule 2-01 do not apply to the\nindependence requirements in Item 1506; however, to the extent any such guidance or\ninterpretation may apply to an issue that is similarly presented under Item 1506 (which is a\npossibility since Item 1506 is modeled on Rule 2-01), the guidance or interpretation would be a\nuseful starting point for consideration, although not determinative.1371\nWe considered the concern raised by commenters that requiring a GHG emissions\nattestation provider to be independent would limit the available pool of providers and potentially\nincrease costs.1372 However, we think these concerns are mitigated by the modifications in the\nfinal rules that provide registrants subject to the requirements with a multi-year transition period\nbefore they are required to obtain an attestation report. The phased in compliance period will\ngive registrants adequate time to find a provider that meets the independence requirements. It\nwill also give non-accountant attestation providers time to familiarize themselves with the\nindependence requirements and adapt their business practices accordingly, which may help\nmitigate any adverse effects that the independence requirements could have on the available pool\nof providers. For this reason, we do not think it is necessary, as suggested by some commenters,\n1370 The final rules do not alter or amend Rule 2-01 or its current applicability in any way, which means, for\nexample, there is no change to the requirement that registrants and their financial statement auditor comply\nwith Rule 2-01 with respect to the financial statement audit.\n1371 The staff of the Commission\u2019s Office of the Chief Accountant is available to consult with registrants or\nGHG emissions attestation providers regarding the independence requirements in the final rules.\n1372 See supra notes 1327, 1328, and 1331 and accompanying text.\n324\n\nto adopt an alternative to the independence requirement to simply disclose the fees received.1373\nAlthough requiring the disclosure of any fees, including non-attestation fees, received by the\nGHG emissions attestation provider from the registrant would provide investors with important\ninformation for evaluating the objectivity of the attestation provider, such an alternative would\nnot prohibit the GHG emissions attestation provider from performing the GHG emissions\nassurance services in circumstances where the provider was not independent from the registrant\n(as the final rules will do). A few commenters stated that the proposed rules\u2019 references to\naccounting or audit-style requirements could favor accounting firms,1374 and we acknowledge\nthat some of the requirements in the final rules, such as the independence requirements, may be\nmore familiar to accounting firms versus non-accounting firms. However, we believe the\nprinciples-based approach in the final rules generally should be accessible for both accounting\nand non-accounting firms. Moreover, the phased in compliance period should give non-\naccountant attestation providers time to familiarize themselves with the independence\nrequirements and provide existing service providers with time to unwind any existing conflicts to\ntheir independence.\nSome commenters suggested that the proposed independence requirement was\nproblematic because it would seem to prohibit an expert or other third-party that has assisted a\nregistrant in calculating or preparing its GHG emissions data from serving as the registrant\u2019s\nGHG emissions attestation provider.1375 We agree that it would be difficult for an expert that has\nassisted a registrant in calculating or preparing its GHG emissions data to meet the independence\n1373 See supra note 1335 and accompanying text.\n1374 See supra note 1293 and accompanying text.\n1375 See supra note 1329 and accompanying text.\n325\n\nrequirements because such an engagement would presumably place the attestation provider in the\nposition of attesting to its own work and may create a mutual interest between the attestation\nprovider and the registrant, two of the factors the final rules state the Commission will consider\nin determining whether the GHG emissions provider is independent.1376 We think the conflict of\ninterest presented by this circumstance is exactly the type of situation that the independence\nrequirement is intended to prevent, and therefore we are not modifying the independence\nrequirement in response to these commenters\u2019 concerns. As a result, this could mean that a\nregistrant that determines it is necessary to hire a third-party service provider to help it calculate\nor prepare its GHG emissions disclosure may have to pay a fee to both the third-party service\nprovider and to its GHG emissions attestation provider. However, the likelihood of this scenario\nis reduced by the multiyear phase in compliance period we are adopting, which provides\nregistrants with sufficient time to develop the necessary processes and procedures to calculate\ntheir GHG emissions data before they are required to comply with the assurance requirements.\nIn addition, the exemption from the GHG emissions reporting and assurance requirements for\nSRCs and EGCs provides most newly public companies with time to develop any in-house\nexpertise that may be necessary in case they no longer qualify for SRC or EGC status in the\nfuture and become subject to the final rules.\nIn response to the commenters that pointed out that the Commission did not adopt a\nrequirement to retain an independent third party to prepare, or conduct a reserves audit of, a\nregistrant\u2019s reserves estimates in the context of its mining and oil and gas disclosure rules,1377 we\n1376 See 17 CFR 229.1506(b)(2)(ii)(A). Conversely, we generally expect that a registrant would be able to use\nits financial statement auditor as its GHG emissions attestation provider consistent with the independence\nrequirement in the final rules.\n1377 See supra note 1332 and accompanying text.\n326\n\nnote that the Commission\u2019s determination in each of its rulemakings about whether to require a\nregistrant to retain an independent third-party is context specific. For example, with respect to\nits mining disclosure rules, the Commission stated that it was not adopting a requirement for a\nqualified person to be independent from the registrant because, among other things, the final\nrules require a registrant to disclose the qualified person\u2019s affiliated status with the registrant or\nanother entity having an ownership or similar interest in the subject property, which is consistent\nwith the Committee for Mineral Reserves International Reporting Standards\u2019 mining guidelines,\nto which the Commission was amending its mining rules to more closely align.1378 With respect\nto its oil and gas disclosure rules, the Commission pointed out that most commenters did not\nsupport a requirement to obtain an independent third-party assessment of reserves estimates\nbecause a company\u2019s internal staff is generally in a better position to prepare those estimates and\nthere is a potential lack of qualified third party engineers and professionals available.1379\nHowever, the Commission did adopt a requirement for a registrant to provide a general\ndiscussion of the internal controls it uses to assure objectivity in the reserves estimation process\nand the disclosure of the qualifications of the technical person primarily responsible for\npreparing the reserves estimates.1380 In keeping with this context specific approach, with respect\nto assurance over GHG emissions disclosure, we believe that the benefits to investors from\nrequiring a GHG emissions attestation provider to be independent in accordance with Item 1506\njustify the potential costs for the reasons stated above. Moreover, there is currently a growing\n1378 See Modernization of Property Disclosures for Mining Registrants, Release No. 33-10098 (June 16, 2016)\n[81 FR 41651, 41661 (June 27, 2016)]; Modernization of Property Disclosures for Mining Registrants,\nRelease No. 33-10570 (Oct. 31, 2018) [83 FR 66344, 66363 (Dec. 26, 2018)].\n1379 See Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting, Release No. 8995 (Dec. 31, 2008) [74 FR 2157, 2175 (Jan.\n14, 2009)].\n1380 See id.\n327\n\npractice among some registrants of obtaining third-party assurance over their GHG emissions\ndata.1381 Although generally the independence requirements in the assurance standards currently\nbeing used with respect to GHG emissions data are not as robust as the requirements in the final\nrules, many of these standards include requirements related to the objectivity and impartiality of\nthe third-party assurance provider.1382 Therefore, the final rules\u2019 independence requirement is\nnot inconsistent with the general practice in this space of retaining an objective and impartial\nthird-party to provide assurance.1383\nIn addition, we are adopting the definition of \u201caffiliate\u201d as proposed and consistent with\nthe feedback provided by commenters that addressed this issue.1384 Similarly, we are adopting\nthe broad definition of \u201cattestation and professional engagement period\u201d as proposed, which is\nmodeled on the definition of \u201caudit and professional engagement period\u201d in Rule 2-01.1385\nAs discussed in greater detail above, in response to a request for comment, some\ncommenters recommended that the Commission require the GHG emissions attestation provider\n1381 See supra note 1232.\n1382 See, e.g., AICPA SSAE No. 18, AT-C \u00a7 105.26; IAASB ISAE 3000 (Revised) \u00a7 20; and ISO 14064-3:\n2019 \u00a7 4.2. The independence requirements in the final rules are more rigorous and may differ in scope\nfrom the requirements included in these standards. It is possible that the application of the independence\nrequirements in the final rules may result in a GHG emissions attestation provider no longer being able to\nprovide certain non-assurance services to its assurance client that may be permissible to provide outside the\ncontext of the final rules.\n1383 The International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA), which is an independent global ethics\nstandard-setting board, has recently proposed ethics standards for sustainability assurance providers (i.e.,\nprofessional accountants and other professionals performing sustainability assurance engagements),\nincluding robust independence standards. IESBA stated that it \u201cholds to the premise that sustainability\nassurance engagements . . . must be underpinned by the same high standards of ethical behavior and\nindependence that apply to audits of financial information.\u201d See IESBA, Explanatory Memorandum for\nProposed International Ethics Standards for Sustainability Assurance (including International Independence\nStandards) (IESSA) and Other Revisions to the Code Relating to Sustainability Assurance and Reporting,\navailable at https://ifacweb.blob.core.windows.net/publicfiles/2024-\n01/Proposed%20IESSA%20and%20Other%20Revisions%20to%20the%20Code%20Relating%20to%20Su\nstainability%20Assurance%20and%20Reporting%20-%20Explanatory%20Memorandum.pdf.\n1384 See supra note 1324.\n1385 See letter from RSM.\n328\n\nto be subject to additional minimum quality control requirements.1386 We have determined not\nto impose such requirements at this time; however, we reiterate the statement the Commission\nmade in the Proposing Release that accountants are already required to comply with relevant\nquality control and management standards when providing audit and attest services under\nPCAOB, AICPA, or IAASB standards, and those quality control and management standards\nwould similarly apply to accountants providing GHG emissions attestation services pursuant to\nthese standards.1387 The IAASB standards impose similar quality control requirements on non-\naccountants.1388 In addition, one commenter stated that, for example, all firms that are accredited\nby one of the members of the IAF must have a quality control and management system.1389 As\nsuch, we believe that many of the more experienced non-accountant GHG emissions attestation\nproviders are required to comply with quality control requirements. More generally, we expect\nthat any attestation standards that meet the requirements of the final rules would likely provide\nguidance on quality control for assurance providers.1390\n1386 See supra note 1340 and accompanying text.\n1387 See Proposing Release, section II.H.2.\n1388 See IAASB ISAE 3000.3(b) (Revised) (\u201cThe practitioner who is performing the engagement is a member\nof a firm that is subject to [International Standard on Quality Control (ISQC) 1], or other professional\nrequirements, or requirements in law or regulation, regarding the firm\u2019s responsibility for its system of\nquality control, that are at least as demanding as ISQC 1.\u201d).\n1389 See letter from ERM CVS. The International Accreditation Forum is a worldwide association of\naccreditation bodies and other bodies interested in conformity assessment in the fields of management\nsystems, products, processes, services, personnel, validation and verification and other similar programs of\nconformity assessment. See International Accreditation Forum, About IAF, available at\nhttps://iaf.nu/en/about/. Its members include ANAB, the ANSI National Accreditation Board, which\nprovides accreditation to greenhouse gas verification and validation providers that demonstrate competence\nto validate or verify statements in accordance with its accreditation requirements, including ISO 14065.\n1390 The ISO standards, which are used by many non-accountant GHG emissions attestation providers as\ndescribed in greater detail below, include two standards that can be used as a basis for requirements for\nattestation providers related to impartiality, competency, and communication, which are areas typically\ncovered by quality control requirements. See ISO 14065, General principles and requirements for bodies\nvalidating and verifying environmental information (2020); and ISO 14066, Environmental information \u2013\nCompetence requirements for teams validating and verifying environmental information (2023).\n329\n\nAlthough the final rules do not include a requirement that a registrant\u2019s audit committee\npre-approve the GHG emissions attestation services, nor was such a requirement proposed, it\nwould be permissible under the final rules for a registrant to use the auditor of its financial\nstatements to perform the GHG emissions attestation engagement, assuming the final rules\u2019\nrequirements for assurance providers are met. To the extent that the registrant\u2019s auditor is\nengaged to provide an attestation report in connection with the registrant\u2019s GHG emissions, or\nwith respect to any other climate-related disclosures, the auditor would be required to comply\nwith applicable, existing pre-approval requirements.1391 Even in circumstances where the GHG\nemissions attestation services are not subject to a pre-approval requirement, however, audit\ncommittees should consider what level of involvement would be appropriate for them to take\nwith respect to the selection and retention of attestation providers for climate-related disclosures.\nIn addition, in response to commenters\u2019 feedback,1392 we are amending Rule 436 to\nprovide that a report by an attestation provider covering Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions at a\nlimited assurance level shall not be considered a part of the registration statement that is prepared\nor certified by an expert or person whose profession gives authority to the statements made\nwithin the meaning of sections 7 and 11 of the Securities Act.1393 We determined to include this\namendment, in part, because we agree with commenters that the potential for section 11 liability\ncould deter or reduce the number of attestation providers willing to accept these\n1391 See 15 U.S.C. 78j-1(i). See also supra note 1280 (explaining that if the independent accountant who audits\nthe registrant\u2019s consolidated financial statements is also engaged to perform the GHG emissions attestation\nfor the same filing, the fees associated with the GHG emissions attestation engagement would be\nconsidered \u201cAudit-Related Fees\u201d for purposes of Item 9(e) of 17 CFR 240.14a-101, Item 14 of Form 10-K,\nItem 16C of Form 20-F, or any similar requirements).\n1392 See supra note 1344 and accompanying text.\n1393 See 17 CFR 230.436(i)(1).\n330\n\nengagements.1394 However, we are limiting the exception to those GHG emissions attestation\nengagements performed at a limited assurance level to encourage GHG emissions attestation\nproviders to perform such engagements. We think there could be reluctance on the part of a\nGHG emissions attestation provider to perform attestation engagements at the limited assurance\nlevel because of their potential liability under section 11, and that, alternatively, if GHG\nemissions attestation providers perform significantly expanded procedures, much closer to\nreasonable assurance, in order to meet potential liability concerns under section 11, substantial\nincreased costs to issuers could result.1395 The same considerations do not apply to reasonable\nassurance engagements, and we are therefore not providing a similar exception for those\nengagements.\nThe amendment to Rule 436 also states that a report covering Scope 3 emissions at a\nlimited assurance level shall not be considered a part of the registration statement that is prepared\nor certified by an expert or person whose profession gives authority to the statements made\nwithin the meaning of sections 7 and 11 of the Securities Act.1396 Although no registrants are\nrequired to disclose Scope 3 emissions or obtain an attestation report for Scope 3 emissions\nunder the final rules, we have included Scope 3 emissions within the exception contained in Rule\n436 in the event that a registrant voluntarily discloses its Scope 3 emissions. We believe it is\nappropriate to provide these accommodations to encourage registrants to obtain limited\nassurance over Scope 3 disclosure.\n1394 See supra note 1345 and accompanying text.\n1395 The Commission relied upon a similar rationale when it amended Rule 436 to provide that a report\nprepared or certified by an accountant within the meaning of sections 7 and 11 of the Securities Act shall\nnot include a report by an independent accountant on a review of unaudited interim financial statements.\nSee Accountant Liability for Reports on Unaudited Interim Financial Information Under Securities Act of\n1933, Release No. 33-6173 (Jan. 8, 1980) [45 FR 1601, 1604 (Jan. 8, 1980)].\n1396 See 17 CFR 230.436(i)(1).\n331\n\nAlthough not subjecting providers of these reports to liability could affect their\nincentives, on balance we think that encouraging more providers to enter this market would\nresult in more competition, which would benefit investors.1397 We acknowledge the potential\ndownsides of not subjecting the providers of these reports to liability; however, as noted\nabove,1398 these accommodations are consistent with the treatment of an accountant\u2019s report on\nunaudited interim financial statements included in a registration statement, which is also\nprovided at the limited assurance level. Therefore, in these particular circumstances, we believe\nit is appropriate to provide these accommodations.\nOne result of the amendments to Rule 436 is that a GHG emissions attestation provider\nthat has performed an attestation engagement over GHG emissions at a limited assurance level is\nnot required to submit a consent in connection with the registration statement under section 7 of\nthe Securities Act.1399 However, we think it is nonetheless important that a GHG emissions\nattestation provider have some awareness about whether its attestation report is included in a\n1397 In situations where GHG emissions attestation providers are experts, the amendments to Rule 436 will\neliminate the potential for section 11 liability for those providers with respect to attestation reports at the\nlimited assurance level. This could reduce the incentives for GHG emissions attestation providers to\nperform a thorough analysis and ensure that their attestation report, which is required to be included in a\nregistration statement with GHG emissions disclosures to which the assurance services relate, is true and\nthat there was no omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the\nstatements therein not misleading. We remind registrants and providers, however, that there are other\nremedies available to shareholders and/or the Commission, such as section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and\nRule 10b-5 thereunder and section 17(a) of the Securities Act, which are not affected by the amendments to\nRule 436.\n1398 See supra note 1395.\n1399 See 15 U.S.C. 77g. The amendments to Rule 436 provide that a report by a GHG emissions attestation\nprovider covering Scope 1, Scope 2, and/or Scope 3 emissions at a limited assurance level shall not be\nconsidered part of the registration statement prepared or certified by an expert or person whose profession\ngives authority to the statements made, and therefore the requirement in section 7 of the Securities Act that\nwritten consent is required from \u201cany person whose profession gives authority to a statement made by him\u201d\nthat is \u201cnamed as having prepared or certified a report . . . for use in connection with the registration\nstatement\u201d does not apply.\n332\n\nregistration statement under the Securities Act.1400 Therefore, we are also amending Item 601 of\nRegulation S-K, which details the exhibits required to be included in Securities Act and\nExchange Act filings, to require registrants to file as an exhibit to certain registration statements\nunder the Securities Act or reports on Form 10-K or 10-Q that are incorporated into these\nregistration statements a letter from the attestation provider that acknowledges its awareness of\nthe use in certain registration statements of any of its reports which are not subject to the consent\nrequirement of section 7.1401 We are amending the Instructions as to Exhibits section of Form\n20-F to include the same requirement for Form 20-F filers to the extent the Form 20-F is\nincorporated into a registration statement under the Securities Act.1402\nWe note that certain commenters urged the Commission to confirm that any attestation\nreports are expertized material, stating that otherwise underwriters may face heightened due\ndiligence requirements in light of potential section 11 liability over GHG emission disclosures\n1400 The Commission relied on this same rationale when it adopted an amendment requiring issuers to file as an\nexhibit to a registration statement a letter from the independent accountants that acknowledges its\nawareness of the use in a registration statement of any of its reports which are not subject to the consent\nrequirement of section 7. See Accountant Liability for Reports on Unaudited Interim Financial Information\nUnder Securities Act of 1933, Release No. 33-6173 (Jan. 8, 1980) [45 FR 1601, 1604 (Jan. 8, 1980)];\nAmendments Regarding Exhibit Requirements, Release No. 6230 (Sept. 5, 1980) [45 FR 58822, 58824\n(Sept. 5, 1980)].\n1401 See 17 CFR 229.601(b)(27). This requirement is modeled on the requirement for an issuer to file as an\nexhibit to a registration statement a letter from the independent public accountant, which acknowledges\ntheir awareness that their report on unaudited interim financial information is being included in a\nregistration statement. See 17 CFR 229.601(b)(15); Accountant Liability for Reports on Unaudited Interim\nFinancial Information Under Securities Act of 1933, Release No. 33-6173 (Jan. 8, 1980) [45 FR 1601,\n1604 (Jan. 8, 1980)]; Amendments Regarding Exhibit Requirements, Release No. 6230 (Sept. 5, 1980) [45\nFR 58822, 58824 (Sept. 5, 1980)]. Although the Commission did not solicit comment specifically on the\nrequirement to provide an acknowledgement letter, the requirement follows from similar contexts noted\nabove. In addition, the associated burdens on issuers are less than the proposed consent requirement while\nretaining the benefit of providing notice to the assurance provider. Further, to help facilitate registrants\u2019\ncompliance with the requirement to file the letter from the GHG emissions attestation provider as an\nexhibit, we have included an instruction to Item 1506 that directs registrants obtaining assurance at a\nlimited assurance level to Item 601(b)(27) (as well as to paragraph 18 of Form 20-F\u2019s Instructions as to\nExhibits, as discussed infra note 1402 and accompanying text).\n1402 See Instructions as to Exhibits 18 of Form 20-F. Where Form 20-F is used a registration statement under\nthe Exchange Act, this exhibit would not be required.\n333\n\nincluded in a registration statement.1403 We also note, as discussed above, that certain\ncommenters stated that deeming the information expertized may have the effect of deterring or\nreducing available assurance providers.1404 We believe the approach we have taken\nappropriately addresses these concerns by exempting the GHG emissions attestation providers\nthat perform limited assurance engagements from section 11 liability and the consent\nrequirements associated with expertized reports, and requiring consent with corresponding\nsection 11 liability only when the heightened level of review associated with reasonable\nassurance makes it appropriate for the report to be expertized. This bifurcated approach to\nreasonable versus limited assurance engagements is consistent with the current treatment of\naudited financial statements and unaudited (reviewed) interim financial statements.1405 While we\nrecognize underwriters and other non-issuer defendants subject to potential liability under\nsection 11 may face additional due diligence costs during the transition period or where limited\nassurance is required,1406 we do not believe this is unduly burdensome compared to other\nclimate-related information that will be required in a registration statement pursuant to the final\nrules that is not otherwise expertized. Moreover, absent a mandatory limited assurance\nrequirement in the final rules, a registrant would nonetheless be required to disclose its GHG\nemissions and underwriters and other defendants subject to potential liability under section 11\nwould be faced with the same potential liability and due diligence costs with respect to those\n1403 See supra note 1346 and accompanying text.\n1404 See supra note 1345 and accompanying text.\n1405 See infra section II.I.5.c discussing an additional amendment to Rule 436 in the context of a registrant\u2019s\nstatements pertaining to voluntary assurance received over GHG emissions disclosure.\n1406 Compare 15 U.S.C. 77k(b)(3)(C) (providing underwriters and others with a defense for expertized\nmaterial) with 15 U.S.C. 77k(b)(3)(A) (providing underwriters and others with a defense for non-expertized\nmaterials).\n334\n\ndisclosures.1407 Finally, the other defenses to liability included in Securities Act section 11(b)\nremain available in accordance with the terms of that provision.1408\n3. GHG Emissions Attestation Engagement and Report Requirements (Item\n1506(a)(2) and (c))\na. Proposed Rules\nThe proposed rules would have required the attestation report required by proposed\nItem 1505(a) for AFs and LAFs to be included in the separately-captioned \u201cClimate-Related\nDisclosure\u201d section in the relevant filing and provided pursuant to standards that are publicly\navailable at no cost and are established by a body or group that has followed due process\nprocedures, including the broad distribution of the framework for public comment.1409 The\nCommission explained that the proposed requirement that the standards be established by a body\nor group that has followed due process procedures would be similar to the requirements for\ndetermining a suitable, recognized control framework for use in management\u2019s evaluation of an\nissuer\u2019s ICFR because in both cases a specific framework is not prescribed but minimum\nrequirements for what constitutes a suitable framework are provided.1410 The Commission stated\n1407 See 17 CFR 229.1505.\n1408 See 15 U.S.C. 77k(b)(3)(A) (providing that \u201cno person, other than the issuer, shall be liable as provided\ntherein who shall sustain the burden of proof . . . as regards any part of the registrant statement not\npurporting to be made on the authority of an expert . . . he had, after reasonable investigation, reasonable\nground to believe and did believe, at the time such part of the registration statement became effective, that\nthe statements therein were true and that there was no omission to state a material fact required to be stated\ntherein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading . . .\u201d).\n1409 See Proposing Release, section II.H.3.\n1410 See id. (citing 17 CFR240.13a-15(c) and 240.15d-15(c) (stating that the \u201cframework on which\nmanagement\u2019s evaluation of the issuer\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is based must be a\nsuitable, recognized control framework that is established by a body or group that has followed due-process\nprocedures, including the broad distribution of the framework for public comment\u201d)).\n335\n\nthat this approach would help to ensure that the standards upon which the attestation engagement\nand report are based are the result of a transparent, public and reasoned process.1411\nIn the Proposing Release, the Commission stated that, for example, in its view, the\nattestation standards of the PCAOB,1412 AICPA,1413 and IAASB1414 would meet the proposed\ndue-process requirement, and all of these standards are publicly available at no cost to investors\nwho desire to review them.1415 The Commission explained that by highlighting these standards,\nit did not mean to imply that other standards currently used in voluntary reporting would not be\nsuitable for use under the proposed rules.1416 The Commission further stated it intended the\nproposal to set minimum standards while acknowledging the current voluntary practices of\nregistrants.1417\nThe proposed rules would have required a GHG emissions attestation provider to follow\nthe specific requirements regarding form and content of the reports set forth by the attestation\nstandard (or standards) used by such attestation provider.1418 In addition, the proposed rules\nwould have imposed minimum requirements for the GHG emissions attestation report to provide\n1411 See Proposing Release, section II.H.3.\n1412 See PCAOB AT section 101.\n1413 See AICPA SSAE No. 18; SSAE No. 22, Review Engagements (limited assurance standard, effective for\nreports dated on or after June 15, 2022), available at\nhttps://us.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/research/standards/auditattest/downloadabledocuments/ssae-22.pdf;\nand SSAE No. 21, Direct Examination Engagements (reasonable assurance standard, effective for reports\ndated on or after June 15, 2022 and will amend SSAE No. 18), available at\nhttps://us.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/research/standards/auditattest/downloadabledocuments/ssae-21.pdf.\n1414 See IAASB ISAE 3000 (Revised).

Comments\nSeveral commenters agreed with the proposal to require that the attestation engagement\nand related attestation report be provided pursuant to standards that are publicly available at no\ncost to investors and are established by a body or group that has followed due process\n1419 See id.\n1420 See id.\n1421 See id.\n1422 See id.\n337\n\nprocedures.1423 One commenter stated that these proposed requirements would \u201chelp to protect\ninvestors who may rely on the attestation report by limiting the standards to those that have been\nsufficiently developed.\u201d1424 Another commenter stated that these proposed requirements would\n\u201cprovide necessary transparency and opportunity for input from all stakeholders.\u201d1425 One\ncommenter stated that public availability of the standards \u201cwould be especially important for\nsmaller investors and registrants.\u201d1426\nConversely, a few commenters disagreed with the proposal to require that the attestation\nengagement and related attestation report be provided pursuant to standards that are publicly\navailable at no cost to investors and are established by a body or group that has followed due\nprocess procedures.1427 One of these commenters stated it \u201cstrongly disagrees\u201d with the proposal\nto require the use of standards that are publicly available at no cost because, in its view, such\nrequirements would preclude the use of ISO 14064-3, a standard widely used for GHG\nverification, and therefore, would not serve the interests of investors.1428\n1423 See, e.g., letters from CAQ; CFA Institute; CII; Crowe; D.

Other commenters suggested that the PCAOB may need to update its\nattestation standards. See, e.g., letters from Crowe (stating that the standard setters for the AICPA and\nIAASB attestation standards have issued standards or guidance on sustainability information, including\nGHG emissions information, while the PCAOB standards do not explicitly address these topics); and RSM\nUS LLP (stating that if \u201cthe Commission determines that attestation engagements related to GHG\nemissions should be conducted in accordance with PCAOB standards, we believe the PCAOB may deem it\nappropriate to update its attestation standards.\u201d).\n1436 See letter from Amer. for Fin.

One commenter recommended that the Commission consider the CDP\u2019s criteria\nfor third party verification standards1451 and another commenter stated that the final rules should\npermit the use of \u201cthe standards accepted by the CDP so as to avoid inadvertently excluding\nqualified providers.1452 In response to a request for comment included in the Proposing Release,\none commenter stated that it did not believe that AccountAbility\u2019s AA1000 Series of Standards\nwould meet the proposed requirements because, among other reasons, it does not believe\nAccountAbility\u2019s process for developing and publishing standards would meet the proposed due\nprocess requirements.1453 However, another commenter stated that the final rules should be\ninclusive of AccountAbility\u2019s AA1000 Series of Standards.1454\nSeveral commenters agreed that the Commission should require the GHG emission\nattestation report to meet certain minimum requirements in addition to any form and content\nrequirements set forth by the attestation standard or standards used, as proposed.1455 One\ncommenter stated that the proposed minimum attestation report requirements are \u201csimilar to the\n1450 See letter from CCR.\n1451 See letter from 3Degree.\n1452 See letter from Climate Risk Consortia.\n1453 See letter from ERM CVS (additionally stating that, under AA1000, the disclosure of data for individual\nmetrics such as GHG emissions cannot be assured separately from assurance on the implementation and\napplication of AA1000APS, which pertains to sustainability management, and that it does not believe that\nmany Commission registrants would be willing to disclose compliance with AA1000APS and obtain\nassurance over all of these disclosures).\n1454 See letter from Climate Risk Consortia.\n1455 See, e.g., letters from CAQ (stating that the proposed minimum requirements for the attestation report \u201cwill\nprovide investors with increased trust and confidence in the GHG emissions data\u201d); CFA Institute; Crowe;\nand RSM US LLP.\n343\n\nrequirements of an independent auditor\u2019s report, which is well-understood by the investment\ncommunity.\u201d1456 Another commenter stated that the proposed minimum requirements for the\nattestation report are particularly important if standards beyond those of the AICPA, IAASB, and\nPCAOB are permitted.1457 One commenter stated that the Commission should also require a\ndescription of the role of internal audit in the underlying GHG emissions data and whether or\nhow the GHG emissions attestation provider relied on internal audit\u2019s work in the minimum\nreport requirements.1458\nOn the other hand, a few commenters recommended against requiring additional\nminimum requirements for attestation reports.1459 One of these commenters stated that the report\nrequirements from the attestation standard used should be sufficient.1460 Another commenter\nrecommended that the Commission clarify whether a report that states the GHG emissions\nattestation provider is disclaiming an opinion on the GHG emissions would satisfy the\nrequirements of Regulation S-K.1461\nRegarding the proposed provision requiring the identification of the criteria against which\nthe subject matter was measured or evaluated, a few commenters agreed that reference to\n1456 See letter from CFA Institute.\n1457 See letter from CAQ.\n1458 See letter from D.

Final Rules\nWe are adopting the GHG emissions attestation engagement and report requirements with\nsome modifications from the proposal.1467 Consistent with the proposed rules, the final rules\n(Item 1506(a)(2)) provide that the attestation report must be provided pursuant to standards that\n1462 See, e.g., letters from ERM CVS; Futurepast; and Mazars.\n1463 See letter from ERM CVS.\n1464 See Proposing Release, section II.H.3.\n1465 See letter from Anthesis Grp.; CRS (stating that, in general, \u201cthe market-based methodology for Scope 2\naccounting as found in 2015 GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance would qualify as suitable criteria against\nwhich Scope 2 emissions disclosure should be evaluated\u201d); D. Hileman Consulting; ERM CVS; Futurepast;\nKPMG; Mazars; PwC; WBCSD; and WRI.\n1466 See letter from Travelers.\n1467 See 17 CFR 229.1506(a)(2), (c).\n345\n\nare established by a body or group that has followed due process procedures, including the broad\ndistribution of the framework for public comment.1468 Most commenters who discussed this\naspect of the proposal supported the proposed requirement related to due process procedures,1469\nand we continue to believe that requiring the attestation report to be provided pursuant to\nstandards that are established by a body or group that has followed due process procedures\nwould help to ensure that the standards upon which the attestation engagement and report are\nbased are the result of a transparent, public, and reasoned process.1470 As the Commission stated\nin the Proposing Release, this requirement should also help to protect investors who may rely on\nthe attestation report by limiting the standards to those that have been sufficiently developed.1471\nThe proposed rules also would have required the attestation standards to be publicly\navailable at no cost. We received feedback from some commenters indicating that including\nsuch a requirement in the final rules would preclude the use of certain standards that are\ncurrently widely used by GHG emissions attestation providers with respect to voluntary\nassurance over GHG emissions disclosures but that are not publicly available for free.1472 After\nconsideration of this feedback, the final rules will require that the attestation report be provided\npursuant to standards that, in addition to being developed using due process, are either (i)\npublicly available at no cost, or (ii) widely used for GHG emissions assurance.1473 In the\nProposing Release, the Commission explained that open access is an important consideration\n1468 See 17 CFR 229.1506(a)(2).\n1469 See supra note 1423 and accompanying text.\n1470 See Proposing Release, section II.H.3.\n1471 See id.\n1472 See supra note 1428 and accompanying text.\n1473 See 17 CFR 229.1506(a)(2).\n346\n\nwhen determining the suitability of attestation standards because it enables investors to evaluate\nthe report against the requirements of the attestation standard.1474 We continue to believe that\nopen access is an important consideration for the reasons the Commission previously stated;\nhowever, we also recognize that the benefits provided by open access may also exist when a\nstandard is widely used in the marketplace such that registrants, GHG emissions attestation\nproviders, and investors have significant experience using, or evaluating disclosure assured\npursuant to, that standard. In addition, it is important to recognize the value that investors have\nfound in the voluntary assurance services currently being provided with respect to climate and\nGHG emissions disclosures. By making this modification to the final rules, we expect that many\nregistrants and GHG emissions attestation providers will be able to continue to use assurance\nstandards they are already using for their voluntary disclosures, assuming that those standards\nmeet the due process requirement.1475 This approach will not only reduce the costs of complying\nwith the final rules1476 but will likely benefit investors by leveraging the experience that GHG\nemissions attestation providers already have with particular standards, which could lead to\nassurance engagements being performed with a greater level of skill initially than if GHG\nemissions attestation providers were required to gain expertise with an unfamiliar standard.\nSeveral commenters agreed with the Commission\u2019s statement in the Proposing Release\nthat the attestation standards of the PCAOB, AICPA, and IAASB would meet the proposed\n1474 See Proposing Release, section II.H.3.\n1475 Registrants and GHG emissions attestation providers would also need to meet the other requirements\nincluded in the final rules relating to the level and scope of the engagement and the expertise and\nindependence of the provider, among other requirements.\n1476 See letter from Futurepast (stating that one benefit of having non-accounting firm attestation providers\nprovide assurance pursuant to ISO or IAASB ISAE standards is that it would make \u201cavailable to registrants\na much larger pool of potential service providers,\u201d which \u201cwill enhance competition and likely result in\nlower costs to registrants\u201d).\n347\n\nattestation standard requirements.1477 We continue to be of the view that the PCAOB, AICPA,\nand IAASB standards meet the due process requirements and are publicly available at no cost to\ninvestors. In addition, in light of our modifications to the final rules, we also believe that the\nISO standards related to the attestation of GHG emissions disclosures would meet these\nrequirements. We agree with those commenters that stated the process the ISO undertakes for\nthe development of its standards is consistent with due process requirement included in the final\nrules.1478\nThe ISO TC 207/SC7 is the technical committee responsible for the development of ISO\n14064-3 \u2013 Greenhouse gases \u2013 Part 3: Specification with guidance for the verification and\nvalidation of greenhouse gas statements.1479 The committee includes members from 120\ncountries, each represented by the country\u2019s national standards body, and the committee also\nliaises with 32 organizations who monitor standards development activities and can provide\ninput during standards development.1480 Members organize consultations among stakeholders in\n1477 See supra note 1432 and accompanying text. The PCAOB has announced an ongoing project to evaluate\nits attestation standards for purposes of developing any potential recommendation to amend, consolidate or\neliminate certain standards as appropriate. See PCAOB, Attestation Standards Update (Updated Sept. 26,\n2022), available at https://pcaobus.org/oversight/standards/standard-setting-research-projects/attestation-\nstandards-update. The AICPA included its attestation standards as an active project under consideration on\nits 2022-23 strategy work plan. See AICPA, 2022-23 ASB strategy work plan, available at\nhttps://us.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/research/standards/auditattest/asb/downloadabledocuments/2022-\n2023-asb-strategy-work-plan.pdf.\n1478 See supra notes 1445 and 1446 and accompanying text.\n1479 See ISO/TC 207/SC7, About us, available at https://committee.iso.org/home/tc207sc7. More generally, the\nISO is a non-governmental organization established in 1947 and based in Geneva, Switzerland. Its mission\nis to promote the development of standardization and related activities in the world with a view to\nfacilitating the international exchange of goods and services, and to developing cooperation in the spheres\nof intellectual, scientific, technological and economic activity. See ANSI, U.S. Representation in ISO,\navailable at https://www.ansi.org/iso/us-representation-in-iso/introduction. ISO is composed of\nrepresentatives from 170 national standards bodies. See ISO, About us, available at\nhttps://www.iso.org/about-us.html.\n1480 See letter from USTAG TC207. The 32 organizations include the European Commission, International\nAccreditation Forum, International Chamber of Commerce, United Nations Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment, World Health Organization, and World Trade Organization, among others. See id.\n348\n\ntheir country to develop a national position on ISO standards.1481 The ISO member from the\nUnited States is ANSI and it publishes on its website a listing of draft ISO standards that are\nopen to public comment.1482 Moreover, ISO follows a consensus process for approval of its\nstandards.1483 This multi-stakeholder process, which includes an opportunity for public\ncomment on proposed standards, is consistent with the reasoned and transparent process the\nCommission described in the Proposing Release as being the foundation for standards that are\nsufficiently developed. This leads us to the conclusion that ISO standards align with the due\nprocess requirement in the final rules.\nAs commenters have noted, ISO standards are not available for free. The ISO standards\nare, however, widely used for GHG emissions assurance. For example, a recent report\ndetermined that for S&P 500 companies that voluntarily obtained assurance over their climate-\nrelated disclosures, including in many cases GHG emissions disclosures, the most common\nstandard referenced by non-accounting firm GHG emission attestation providers was ISO 14064-\n3.1484 Specifically, the report found that ISO standards were used in connection with 196 out of\na total 346 engagements.1485 This frequency of use aligns with the \u201cwidely used\u201d criteria in the\nfinal rules.\nIt is important to note that by highlighting these standards, we do not mean to imply that\nother standards, either those currently in existence, or those that may develop in the future,\nwould not be suitable for use under the final rules. Commenters recommended a number of\n1481 See id.\n1482 See ANSI Standards Action, available at https://www.ansi.org/resource-center/standards-action.\n1483 See ISO, Developing standards, available at https://www.iso.org/developing-standards.html.\n1484 See CAQ, S&P 500 and ESG Reporting (Updated June 2023) (providing statistics for 2021).\n1485 See id.\n349\n\nalternative approaches, such as providing a list of acceptable standards,1486 or requiring the use\nof a particular standard.1487 Although we considered these alternatives, we ultimately agreed\nwith those commenters who stated that the Commission should take a flexible approach to the\nacceptable standards in recognition that more than one suitable standard exists, and others could\ndevelop in the future.1488\nThe final rules (Item 1506(c)) require the form and content of the GHG emissions\nattestation report to follow the requirements set forth by the attestation standard or standards\nused, as proposed; however, in a shift from the proposal, the final rules do not prescribe\nminimum report requirements.1489 The Commission explained in the Proposing Release that the\nproposed minimum components were all common elements of current assurance reports,1490 a\npoint that was affirmed in the feedback we received from commenters.1491 We continue to\nexpect that the attestation standards that meet the requirements of the final rules will generally\n1486 See supra note 1430 and accompanying text. See also letter from Climate Risk Consortia (recommending\nthat the Commission permit the use of \u201cthe standards accepted by the CDP\u201d).\n1487 See supra notes 1433, 1435, 1437, and 1439 and accompanying text.\n1488 See supra note 1428 and accompanying text. For example, in the Proposing Release, the Commission\nincluded a request for comment asking if AccountAbility\u2019s AA1000 Series of Standards would meet the\nproposed requirements for attestation standards. We received one comment that stated the final rule should\nbe written in a way that is inclusive of all standards, including AA1000, among others, but the commenter\ndid not provide any substantiative reasons why AA1000 would meet the proposed criteria. See letter from\nClimate Risk Consortia. Another commenter stated that the process for developing the AA1000 standard\nwould not meet the proposed due process requirements. See letter from ERM CVS. Although the feedback\nwe received from commenters was mixed, to the extent that the AA1000 standard meets the criteria in the\nfinal rule, registrants and GHG emissions attestation providers would not be precluded from using it in\nconnection with complying with the final rules. The staff of the Commission\u2019s Office of the Chief\nAccountant is available to consult with registrants about whether a particular standard meets the\nrequirements in the final rules.\n1489 See 17 CFR 229.1506(c).\n1490 The Commission explained in the Proposing Release that it primarily derived the proposed requirements\nfrom the AICPA\u2019s attestation standard (e.g., SSAE No. 18), which are largely similar to the report\nrequirements under PCAOB AT-101 and IAASB ISAE 3410. See Proposing Release, section II.H.3.\n1491 See supra note 279 and accompanying text.\n350\n\ninclude all of the elements that were proposed.1492 Therefore, the benefit of including the\nproposed minimum requirements would be marginal, at best, and could be viewed as redundant\nand adding unnecessary complexity and associated burdens to the final rules. Instead, simply\nrequiring the attestation report to follow the form and content requirements of the attestation\nstandard or standards should provide investors with important information about the attestation\nengagement in a consistent and comparable manner. Nevertheless, in light of this shift to a more\nprinciples-based approach, to the extent that a particular attestation standard does not include\nelements sufficiently similar to those commonly included in an assurance report, the GHG\nemissions attestation provider should consider including such information in its attestation report\nto facilitate investors\u2019 understanding of the nature and scope of the engagement. Although some\ncommenters suggested additional minimum requirements that could be included in the final\nrules,1493 we decided against including any additional requirements for the same reason.\nA few commenters asked the Commission to clarify the level of assurance that is required\nfor historical periods in a registrant\u2019s filing.1494 We are therefore clarifying that the final rules\napply on a prospective basis only with disclosure for historical periods phasing in over time.\nSpecifically, in the first year that an AF or LAF is required to provide an attestation report, such\nreport is only required to cover the Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions for its most recently\ncompleted fiscal year. To the extent the AF or LAF disclosed Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions\nfor a historical period, it would not be required to obtain an assurance report covering such\nhistorical period in the first year of the attestation rule\u2019s applicability. However, for each\n1492 See supra note 1490. See also ISO 14064-3, \u00a7\u00a7 6.3.2 and 9.3.\n1493 See supra note 1458 and accompanying text.\n1494 See, e.g., letters from Deloitte & Touche (requesting that the Commission clarify the level of assurance that\nis required for historical periods); and Grant Thornton (same).\n351\n\nsubsequent fiscal year\u2019s annual report, the registrant will be required to provide an attestation\nreport for an additional fiscal year until an attestation report is provided for the entire period\ncovered by the registrant\u2019s GHG emissions disclosures. In circumstances where more than one\nGHG emissions provider may have provided an attestation report for the different fiscal years\nincluded in the filing, a GHG emissions attestation provider should be clear about its\ninvolvement with any historical information, including disclaiming any such involvement where\napplicable.1495\nIn response to a request for comment, a few commenters agreed that a reference to\nproposed Item 1504 would meet the \u201csuitable criteria\u201d requirement under the prevailing\nattestation standard and that the provisions of the GHG Protocol would qualify as \u201csuitable\ncriteria\u201d against which Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions disclosure should be evaluated.1496\nConsistent with the Proposing Release, we reiterate that prevailing attestation standards require\nthe criteria against which the subject matter is measured or evaluated to be \u201csuitable.\u201d1497\nSuitable criteria, when followed, will result in reasonably consistent measurement or evaluation\nof the registrant\u2019s disclosure that is within the scope of the engagement.1498 Consistent with\ncommenter feedback, Item 1505 of Regulation S-K will satisfy the suitable criteria requirements\nof the prevailing attestation standards because the proposed requirements set forth relevant,\n1495 This guidance parallels similar practices in the context of the financial statement audit. See, e.g., PCAOB\nAS 3101, The Auditor's Report on an Audit of Financial Statements When the Auditor Expresses an\nUnqualified Opinion, paragraph 18h, available at https://pcaobus.org/oversight/standards/auditing-\nstandards/details/AS3101.\n1496 See supra note 1462 and accompanying text.\n1497 See Proposing Release, section II.H.3.\n1498 Characteristics of suitable criteria include relevance, objectivity, measurability, and completeness. See,\ne.g., AICPA SSAE No. 18, AT-C \u00a7105.A16 and A42; AICPA SSAE No. 21, AT-C \u00a7105.A16 and .A44. In\naddition to relevance and completeness, the characteristics of suitable criteria under IAASB ISAE\n3000.A23 include reliability, neutrality and understandability. Therefore, despite the differences in the\ncharacteristics listed, the underlying concepts and objectives are consistent.\n352\n\nobjective standards that call for measurable and complete disclosure of GHG emissions that\nwould allow for a consistent evaluation of the registrant\u2019s disclosure.1499 In addition, in response\nto a question from a commenter,1500 we are clarifying that a report that states the GHG emissions\nattestation provider is disclaiming an opinion on the GHG emissions would not constitute\ncompliance by the AF or LAF with the requirement to obtain an attestation report over its Scope\n1 and/or Scope 2 emissions under the final rules.\nConsistent with the proposed rules, the final rules do not require a registrant to obtain an\nattestation report specifically covering the effectiveness of internal control over GHG emissions\ndisclosure.1501 Such a report would not be required even when the GHG emissions attestation\nengagement is performed at a reasonable assurance level. As explained in the Proposing\nRelease, given the current evolving state of GHG emissions reporting and assurance, existing\nDCP obligations and the requirement that AFs and LAFs (initially) obtain at least limited\nassurance of such disclosure are appropriate first steps toward enhancing the reliability of GHG\nemissions disclosure.1502\nAs explained above in section II.H.3, in a modification from the proposal, the final rules\nwill not require that GHG emissions disclosure be provided in a separately captioned \u201cClimate-\n1499 In addition, to the extent an AF or LAF chooses to disclose its Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions pursuant\nto Item 1505 and leverages the GHG Protocol\u2019s methodologies, we agree with the commenters that stated\nthe provisions of the GHG Protocol would qualify as \u201csuitable criteria\u201d against which the Scope 1 and/or\nScope 2 emissions disclosure should be evaluated. See supra note 1366 and accompanying text.\n1500 See letter from Grant Thornton.\n1501 See Proposing Release, section II.H.3.\n1502 See id. Under prevailing attestation standards for limited assurance engagements, the testing of and\nattestation over internal controls are not required. See, e.g., AICPA SSAE No. 22, AT-C \u00a7 210.A16. With\nrespect to reasonable assurance, while there are requirements under prevailing attestation standards to\nconsider and obtain an understanding of internal controls, there is no required attestation of the\neffectiveness of internal controls such as that included in section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002\n(Sarbanes-Oxley Act). See 15 U.S.C. 7262(b) (requiring a registered public accounting firm that prepares\nor issues an audit report for certain issuers to attest to, and report on, the assessment made by the\nmanagement of the issuer with respect to internal controls).\n353\n\nRelated Disclosure\u201d section in the relevant filing. Therefore, the final rules do not require a\nregistrant to include an attestation report in such a section, although a registrant may choose to\ndo so.\nOne commenter asked the Commission to clarify whether, to the extent the Commission\npermits the use of standards other than those developed by the PCAOB, AICPA, and IAASB, the\nCommission should clarify \u201cwhether all practitioners should be required to consider \u2018other\ninformation\u2019 in the same way as CPAs.\u201d1503 The GHG emissions attestation provider must\nperform the engagement in accordance with the requirements included in the attestation standard\nbeing used. We are clarifying that, to the extent an attestation standard requires an attestation\nprovider to consider \u2018other information,\u2019 then the provider would be required to comply with\nsuch a requirement to perform the engagement in accordance with the standard.\nOne commenter stated that, due to the proposed phase in for the assurance requirements,\nan LAF or AF may be required to obtain assurance over its GHG emissions disclosures, while its\nconsolidated public subsidiaries are not (or not yet) subject to the same level of assurance.1504\nThis commenter asked the Commission to consider clarifying whether the consolidated\nsubsidiary is expected to obtain assurance based on the requirements of its parent entity or\nentities, and if not, how the assurance provider for the parent entity or entities would report the\nlevel of assurance provided over the individual components of the reporting entity.1505 In\nresponse to the specific factual scenario raised by this commenter, we are clarifying that the\nconsolidated information included in the parent company\u2019s Commission filing would need to\n1503 See letter from KPMG.\n1504 See letter from Grant Thornton.\n1505 See id.\n354\n\ncomply with the final rules\u2019 requirements applicable to the parent company. This means that a\nsubsidiary\u2019s information that is part of the consolidated reporting of its parent company will need\nto be assured as part of the assurance over the parent company\u2019s consolidated reporting even if\nthe consolidated subsidiary itself is not subject to assurance. This is consistent with how the\nauditing standards over consolidated financial statements generally apply.\nAlong similar lines, another commenter stated that there might be instances where a\nsubsidiary of a registrant has a separate attestation engagement performed over its GHG\nemissions data to meet local statutory or jurisdictional requirements and the subsidiary might\nchoose an attestation provider at the local level that differs from the attestation provider retained\nto perform the assurance required under the Commission\u2019s rules.1506 This commenter stated, for\nexample, if a subsidiary\u2019s attestation engagement was performed by an accounting firm provider\nthat used AICPA standards, then AICPA attestation standards would allow the provider\nperforming the assurance required under the Commission\u2019s rules to use the work of another\npractitioner; however, AICPA standards do not address the ability of an accounting firm provider\nto use the work of a non-accountant practitioner, particularly when the non-accountant uses\ndifferent attestation standards.1507 Consistent with our response above, we are clarifying that the\nconsolidated information included in the parent company\u2019s Commission filing would need to\ncomply with the final rules\u2019 requirements applicable to the parent company. As is the case with\nother new disclosure requirements, the Commission staff is available to answer practice\nquestions as registrants begin applying the final rules.\n1506 See letter from Crowe.\n1507 See id.\n355\n\n4. Additional Disclosure by the Registrant (Item 1506(d))\na. Proposed Rules\nIn addition to the proposed minimum attestation report requirements described above, the\nproposed rules would have required disclosure of certain additional matters related to the\nattestation of a registrant\u2019s GHG emissions.1508 With respect to the Scope 1 and Scope 2\nemissions attestation required pursuant to proposed Item 1505(a) for AFs and LAFs, the\nproposed rules would have required the registrant to disclose in the filing, based on relevant\ninformation obtained from any GHG emissions attestation provider:\n\u2022 Whether the attestation provider has a license from any licensing or accreditation body to\nprovide assurance, and if so, the identity of the licensing or accreditation body, and\nwhether the attestation provider is a member in good standing of that licensing or\naccreditation body;\n\u2022 Whether the GHG emission attestation engagement is subject to any oversight inspection\nprogram, and if so, which program (or programs);1509 and\n\u2022 Whether the attestation provider is subject to record-keeping requirements with respect to\nthe work performed for the GHG emissions attestation engagement and, if so, identify the\nrecord-keeping requirements and the duration of those requirements.1510\nThe Commission stated that these disclosures are not typically included in an attestation\nreport and would not be included in the GHG emissions attestation report under the proposed\n1508 See Proposing Release, section II.H.4.\n1509 In the Proposing Release, the Commission stated that one example of an oversight program would be the\nAICPA peer review program, among others. See id.\n1510 See id.\n356\n\nrules.1511 Instead, the registrant would be required to provide these disclosures in the separately\ncaptioned \u201cClimate-Related Disclosure\u201d section, where the GHG emissions disclosure would be\nprovided pursuant to the proposed rules.1512\nb. Comments\nA few commenters generally agreed that the Commission should require the proposed\nitems of disclosure to be provided by the registrant in the filing that includes the attestation\nreport (where the GHG emissions and other climate-related disclosures are presented), based on\nrelevant information obtained from the GHG emissions attestation provider as proposed.1513\nAlternatively, several commenters stated that they supported such disclosure requirements when\nthe GHG emissions attestation provider is not registered with the PCAOB.1514 One of these\ncommenters explained that when a registrant uses a PCAOB-registered accounting firm as its\nGHG emissions attestation provider it should not be required to make the proposed additional\ndisclosures \u201c[g]iven that a PCAOB-registered accounting firm is already complying with\nstringent requirements for things such as licensure, oversight, and record-keeping,\u201d which is\n\u201cwell understood by investors.\u201d1515 On the other hand, one commenter stated that registrants\nshould not be required to provide these additional items of disclosure because, in its view, these\n1511 See id.\n1512 See id.\n1513 See letters from Amer. for Fin. Reform, Sunrise Project et al.; and ICAEW.\n1514 See, e.g., letters from CAQ; CFA Institute; Crowe (\u201cIf a registrant uses its financial statement auditor, who\ncurrently must meet the requirements in Article 2 of Reg. S-X, to also perform any required GHG\nemissions attestation, we recommend the SEC consider exempting those registrants from additional\ndisclosures.\u201d); and PwC (stating that given the importance of licensing, oversight, and record-keeping\nrequirements they should be added to the qualifications necessary to be a GHG emissions attestation\nprovider).\n1515 See letter from CAQ.\n357\n\nare not \u201cappropriate determinations to be made by registrants and instead believe that this\ndisclosure, if retained, should be included in the attestation provider\u2019s report itself.\u201d1516\nSome commenters stated they agreed with the proposed requirement for a registrant to\ndisclose whether the GHG emissions attestation provider has a license from an accreditation\nbody.1517 One of these commenters explained that this information \u201cwould be helpful to\ninvestors as they could then rely on the licensing and accreditation bodies to vet the provider\u2019s\nexpertise rather than needing to evaluate other related information.\u201d1518 A few commenters\nstated that they disagreed with the proposed requirement for registrants to disclose whether the\nattestation provider has a license from any licensing or accreditation provider. One commenter\nexplained that \u201c[i]n the absence of a universal certification or credential, registrants will\nseemingly bear the risk and burden of making a determination regarding the qualifications of an\nappropriate provider and disclosing these qualifications, and many registrants may lack the\nexpertise to make such a determination or disclosure.\u201d1519 Similarly, another commenter stated\nthat the \u201centity granting and monitoring professional practice for these credentials should bear\nthe responsibility for making public disclosures\u201d on these topics with the GHG emissions\nattestation provider providing \u201ca citation to the granting entity\u2019s website.\u201d1520 One commenter\nurged the Commission to \u201cdefer action\u201d on this matter until after the rules have been\nimplemented for a period of time.1521\n1516 See letter from ABA. See also letter from D. Hileman (stating that \u201cnone of the proposed requirements in\nthis section should be borne by the registrant\u201d).\n1517 See, e.g., letters from ICAEW; ICI; Morningstar; and RSM.\n1518 See letter from RSM.\n1519 See letter from ABA.\n1520 See letter from D. Hileman.\n1521 See letter from Futurepast.\n358\n\nThe Proposing Release included a request for comment asking if, in lieu of only requiring\ndisclosure about whether the GHG emissions attestation provider has a license from an\naccreditation body, the Commission instead should require a GHG emissions attestation provider\nto be licensed to provide assurance by specified licensing or accreditation bodies, and if so,\nwhich bodies the Commission should specify.1522 One commenter stated that \u201creview by a\nlicensed or accredited firm with minimum standards is essential for reliable GHG emissions\nreporting.\u201d1523 Conversely, one commenter stated that the Commission should not require\naccreditation or require a GHG emissions attestation provider \u201cto be a member in good standing\nof a particular body\u201d because it could unintentionally disqualify an appropriate provider.1524\nAlthough the proposed rules would not have required a GHG emissions attestation provider to be\nlicensed, one commenter asked the Commission to clarify \u201cwhich existing licensing or\naccrediting bodies meet SEC standards\u201d under the proposed rules.1525\nSome commenters agreed that the Commission should require a registrant to disclose\nwhether the GHG emissions attestation engagement is subject to any oversight inspection\nprogram, and if so, which program(s), as proposed.1526 One commenter stated that this proposed\nrequirement \u201cwould provide decision-useful information to investors.\u201d1527 On the other hand,\n1522 See Proposing Release, section II.H.4.\n1523 See letter from Salesforce.

Final Rules\nThe Commission is adopting the requirement for registrants to disclose certain additional\ninformation related to the attestation of a registrant\u2019s GHG emissions with significant\nmodifications from the proposal.1541 To reduce the burdens on issuers that would have arisen\nunder the proposed rules, and in response to certain commenter feedback described above, we\nare not adopting a requirement for registrants to disclose (1) whether the attestation provider has\na license from any licensing or accreditation body to provide assurance; and (2) whether the\nattestation provider is subject to record-keeping requirements with respect to the work performed\nfor the GHG emissions attestation engagement. However, consistent with the proposal, the final\nrules (Item 1506(d)) require registrants to disclose whether the GHG emission attestation\nengagement is subject to any oversight inspection program, subject to certain modifications.1542\nIn addition, in a modification from the proposal, the final rules require registrants to disclose\ncertain information when there is a change in, and disagreement with, the registrant\u2019s GHG\nemissions attestation provider as discussed in greater detail below.1543\nThe decision not to adopt a requirement for a registrant to disclose whether its GHG\nemissions attestation provider has a license from any licensing or accreditation body will\neliminate the potential for confusion about when disclosure is required, thus reducing the burden\nassociated with the final rules. Although the existence of a license for a GHG emissions\nattestation provider that is a certified public accountant is straightforward to determine because\ncertified public accountants and their firms must be registered with state boards of\n1541 See 17 CFR 229.1506(d).\n1542 See 17 CFR 229.1506(d)(1).\n1543 See 17 CFR 229.1506(d)(2).\n362\n\naccountancy,1544 it may be more difficult for a registrant to determine if a non-accountant GHG\nemissions attestation provider holds a license. Furthermore, although accreditation and\ncertification organizations exist for GHG emissions attestation providers that are not\naccountants,1545 it may be difficult for registrants and even GHG emissions attestation providers\nthemselves to determine whether the credential conferred by such organization constitutes a\n\u201clicense,\u201d or if it is some other type of accreditation or certification. Therefore, we agree with\nthe commenter that pointed out the \u201cabsence of a universal certification or credential\u201d likely\nwould make it difficult for registrants to determine whether disclosure is required.1546\nWe decided not to require a registrant to disclose whether the attestation provider is\nsubject to record-keeping requirements with respect to the work performed for the GHG\nemissions attestation engagement to reduce burdens on registrants. Upon further consideration,\nthis proposed requirement would seem to have marginal benefit to investors making investment\nor voting decisions while adding complexity to issuer disclosures. Instead, the final rules focus\nthe disclosure requirements on the more significant disclosure of the existence of an oversight\ninspection program.1547\nThe proposed rules would have required a registrant to disclose whether the GHG\nemissions attestation engagement is subject to any oversight inspection program, and if so, which\n1544 See, e.g., National Association of State Boards of Accountancy, Getting a License, available at\nhttps://nasba.org/licensure/gettingacpalicense/ (explaining the licensure process for certified public\naccountants and accounting firms by state boards of accountancy).\n1545 See, e.g., letter from ANSI NAB (describing itself as the \u201conly peer recognized accreditation body\noperating an accreditation program for oversight of greenhouse gas (GHG) validation and verification\nbodies (attestation providers) in the United States.\u201d).\n1546 See letter from ABA.\n1547 See 17 CFR 229.1506(d).\n363\n\nprogram (or programs).1548 We are adopting this requirement as proposed.1549 In response to\ncommenters,1550 we are clarifying, for purposes of the final rules, that we would consider a GHG\nemissions attestation engagement to be subject to an oversight inspection program if it is possible\nthat the assurance services could be inspected pursuant to the oversight program, even if it is not\ncertain that the services will be inspected in a particular inspection cycle. An example of such an\noversight inspection program is the AICPA\u2019s peer review program, which includes within its\nscope attestation engagements performed by a certified public accountant in accordance with\nAICPA standards.1551 Commenters did not offer any examples of oversight inspection programs\nthat would include within their scope GHG emissions attestation engagements performed by\nnon-accountants. Even if no such programs currently exist, it is possible that they could develop\nin the future given the evolving nature of GHG emissions assurance practices. Accordingly, we\ncontinue to believe that the existence of an oversight inspection program will help investors\nbetter understand the qualifications of the GHG emissions attestation provider, which in turn will\nhelp them determine whether the assurance services have enhanced the reliability of the GHG\nemissions disclosure.\nIn addition to requiring a registrant to disclose whether the GHG emissions attestation\nengagement is subject to any oversight inspection program as proposed, the final rules also\nrequire a registrant to disclose whether the GHG emissions attestation provider is subject to any\n1548 See Proposing Release, section II.H.4.\n1549 See 17 CFR 229.1506(d).\n1550 See supra notes 1532 and 1533 and accompanying text.\n1551 Under the AICPA Peer Review Program, firms that are members of the AICPA are required to have a peer\nreview of their accounting and auditing practice once every three years in accordance with the AICPA\nStandards for Performing and Reporting on Peer Reviews. The peer review is conducted by an independent\nevaluator, known as a peer reviewer, who reviews a sample of the firm\u2019s work against the requirements of\napplicable professional standards in all material respects. See Summary of AICPA Peer Review Program,\navailable at https://us.aicpa.org/research/standards/peerreview/peer-review-summary.html.\n364\n\noversight inspection program, and if so, which program (or programs).1552 To be clear, this\nrequirement is not limited to oversight inspection programs that include within their scope, or\nrequire the inspection of, the GHG emissions attestation engagement. Rather, the final rules\nrequire the disclosure of \u201cany\u201d oversight inspection program that applies to the GHG emissions\nattestation provider.1553 Therefore, a registrant must disclose any oversight inspection program\nthe GHG emissions attestation provider is subject to for any type of engagement (e.g., a financial\nstatement audit or other review).1554 This additional requirement will provide investors with a\nbetter understanding of the qualifications of the GHG emissions attestation provider because\nsuch oversight can provide a check on a provider\u2019s overall activities and drive improvements in\nthe quality of their services.1555\nWe considered whether to only require disclosure about the existence of oversight\ninspections programs from registrants who engage GHG emission attestation providers that are\n1552 See 17 CFR 229.1506(d).\n1553 See id.\n1554 Examples of such oversight inspection programs include the AICPA\u2019s peer review program or the\nPCAOB\u2019s inspection program. The AICPA\u2019s peer review program and PCAOB\u2019s inspection program are\ntwo examples of types of oversight inspection programs that a GHG emissions attestation provider may be\nsubject to generally; however, only the AICPA\u2019s peer review program would include within its scope the\nGHG emissions attestation engagement. The PCAOB\u2019s inspection jurisdiction is limited to audits of\nissuers and registered brokers and dealers and does not include attestation engagements for GHG emissions\ndisclosure within its scope. See 15 U.S.C. 7214 (setting forth the PCAOB\u2019s inspection jurisdiction).\nConsistent with our explanation above, commenters did not offer any examples of oversight inspection\nprograms that apply to non-accountant GHG emissions attestation providers.\n1555 For example, in the context of inspections of PCAOB-registered public accounting firms, academic\nliterature suggests that engagement-specific PCAOB inspections may have spillover effects on non-\ninspected engagements. See, e.g., Daniel Aobdia, The Impact of the PCAOB Individual Engagement\nInspection Process\u2014Preliminary Evidence, 93Acct. Rev. 53, 53-80 (2018) (concluding that \u201cengagement-\nspecific PCAOB inspections influence non-inspected engagements, with spillover effects detected at both\npartner and office levels\u201d and that \u201cthe information communicated by the PCAOB to audit firms is\napplicable to non-inspected engagements\u201d); Daniel Aobdia, The Economic Consequences of Audit Firms\u2019\nQuality Control System Deficiencies, 66 Mgmt. Sci. (2020) (concluding that \u201ccommon issues identified in\nPCAOB inspections of individual engagements can be generalized to the entire firm, despite the PCAOB\nclaiming its engagement selection process targets higher risk clients\u201d and that \u201c[PCAOB quality control]\nremediation also appears to positively influence audit quality\u201d).\n365\n\nnot registered with the PCAOB, as suggested by some commenters.1556 However, we are\nconcerned that requiring this disclosure only with respect to certain GHG emission attestation\nproviders could result in confusion and believe that requiring registrants to provide such\ndisclosure with respect to all GHG emissions attestation providers will enhance the consistency\nand comparability of disclosures. Moreover, to the extent that a particular GHG emissions\nattestation provider is registered with the PCAOB, we would not expect it to be time consuming\nor difficult for a registrant to make this disclosure, which would presumably remain the same\nfrom year-to-year absent any changes to PCAOB rules.\nWe also considered whether to require such disclosure to be included in the attestation\nreport as recommended by one commenter,1557 instead of requiring the registrant to disclose this\ninformation in the filing that includes the attestation report as proposed. We understand that\nwhether the attestation provider is subject to any oversight inspection program is in the first\ninstance known by the attestation provider rather than the registrant, and therefore it may seem\nreasonable to require the attestation provider to make the disclosure rather than the registrant.\nHowever, we do not expect it would be difficult or burdensome for a registrant to obtain this\ninformation from the GHG emissions attestation provider, and in fact, we expect that most\nregistrants would want to know about the existence of an oversight inspection program before\nretaining an attestation provider in most instances and therefore likely will already have such\ninformation in their possession. Moreover, we continue to believe that requiring such disclosure\nto be included in the attestation report may create confusion because this disclosure may not be\nrequired by existing attestation standards.\n1556 See supra note 400 and accompanying text.\n1557 See supra note 402 and accompanying text.\n366\n\nAs stated above, the Commission included a request for comment in the Proposing\nRelease asking if it should require disclosure when there is a change in, or disagreement with, the\nregistrant\u2019s GHG emissions attestation provider that is similar to the disclosure requirements in\nItem 4.01 of Form 8-K and Item 304 of Regulation S-K.1558 The commenters that responded to\nthe request for comment generally agreed with including such a requirement in the final rules.1559\nBecause we believe that requiring the disclosure of information regarding changes in, and\ndisagreements with, a GHG emissions attestation provider would provide investors with\nimportant information about the provider and the conduct of the attestation engagement, which\ninvestors need to help them assess the reliability of the registrant\u2019s GHG emissions disclosures,\nwe have included a provision in the final rules that will require AFs and LAFs subject to Item\n1506(a) to disclose certain information when the registrant\u2019s GHG emissions attestation provider\nresigns (or indicates that it declines to stand for re-appointment after completion of the\nattestation engagement) or is dismissed.1560\nWe have generally modeled this aspect of the final rules on the disclosure requirements in\nItem 4.01 of Form 8-K and Item 304 of Regulation S-K, tailored to fit the context of a GHG\nemissions attestation engagement and to limit additional burdens.1561 In particular, our decision\nto require the disclosure in the filing that contains the GHG emissions disclosures and attestation\nreport (e.g., a registration statement or an annual report that requires disclosure pursuant to Item\n1558 See Proposing Release, Section II.H.2.\n1559 See supra note 1539 and accompanying text.\n1560 See 17 CFR 229.1502(d)(2).\n1561 Although we have generally modeled these aspects of the final rules on existing requirements, in addition\nto the substantive differences discussed herein, we have also made several non-substantive changes and\nupdates for readability. For the avoidance of doubt, neither the final rules nor this discussion should be\nconstrued as a modification or interpretation of the existing requirements on which they were modeled.\n367\n\n1506), instead of an alternative such as requiring a registrant to provide the disclosure in a Form\n8-K, should serve to limit additional burdens associated with this provision. We believe that\nrequiring similar disclosure for GHG emissions attestation providers to be included in the annual\nreport or registration statement that contains the attestation report is appropriate because it will\nprovide investors with the essential information they need to evaluate the assurance services\nprovided while minimizing the need for additional filings by a registrant.\nSpecifically, the final rules (Item 1506(d)(2)) will require an AF or LAF subject to Item\n1506(a) to disclose whether its former GHG emissions attestation provider resigned or was\ndismissed and the date thereof.1562 If so, the registrant must state whether during the\nperformance of the attestation engagement for the fiscal year covered by the attestation report\nthere were any disagreements with the former GHG emissions attestation provider over any\nmeasurement or disclosure of GHG emission or attestation scope of procedures.1563 The final\nrules will require the registrant to describe each such disagreement and state whether the\nregistrant has authorized the former GHG emissions attestation provider to respond fully to the\ninquiries of the successor GHG emissions attestation provider concerning the subject matter of\neach such disagreement.1564 Like the other elements of the disclosure requirement, this is\nmodeled on the requirement to disclose disagreements between a registrant and its independent\nauditor in connection with the auditor\u2019s dismissal or resignation in Item 304 of Regulation S-K,\nand just as in that context, it is important that significant disagreements are brought to the\n1562 See 17 CFR 229.1506(d)(2)(i). Therefore, the registrant will be required to provide disclosure in\ncircumstances where: (1) a GHG emissions attestation provider resigns or is dismissed during the fiscal\nyear covered by the attestation report but it does not issue the attestation report; and (2) a GHG emissions\nattestation provider issues an opinion or conclusion on GHG emissions disclosure for the relevant fiscal\nyear but is dismissed or resigns before the attestation report is filed.\n1563 See 17 CFR 229.1506(d)(2)(i)(B).\n1564 See 17 CFR 229.1506(d)(2)(i)(B)(1)-(2).\n368\n\nattention of investors.1565 The disclosure of the existence of a disagreement in the event of the\nresignation or dismissal of the GHG emissions attestation provider will enable investors to assess\nthe possible effects of such disagreement and whether it could have impacted the reliability of\nthe GHG emissions disclosure, which, as discussed above, provides investors with information\nabout a registrant\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition. The final rules also\ninclude two instructions defining the term \u201cdisagreements\u201d for purposes of the disclosure and\nexplaining the circumstances in which it is sufficient to conclude that a disagreement has been\ncommunicated to the registrant.1566 This definition and explanation is consistent with Item 304\nof Regulation S-K and its Instructions, with minor modifications to take into account the\ncircumstances of a GHG emissions attestation engagement.1567\nWe have determined to take an incremental approach to requiring disclosure about the\nresignation or dismissal of a GHG emissions attestation provider and therefore have not included\na requirement for the registrant to request the former GHG emissions attestation provider to\nfurnish the registrant with a letter addressed to the Commission stating whether it agrees with the\nstatements made by the registrant with respect to the resignation or dismissal and disagreement\n(if applicable). The final rules, however, do not preclude a registrant from disclosing its\nexplanation of the dismissal or resignation to its former GHG emissions attestation provider, and\nalthough not required, we encourage any GHG emissions attestation provider to convey concerns\nit has with the registrant\u2019s description of those events to the Commission\u2019s Office of the Chief\nAccountant.\n1565 See Registrants and Independent Accountants Amended Rules for Increased Disclosure of Relationships,\nRelease No. 33-5550 (Dec. 20, 1974) [40 FR 1010, 1011 (Jan. 6, 1975)].\n1566 See 17 CFR 229.1506(d)(2)(ii)-(iii).\n1567 See 17 CFR 229.304(a)(1)(iv); and Instructions 4 and 5 to Item 304.\n369\n\nThe requirement to disclose certain information when a GHG emissions attestation\nprovider resigns or is dismissed only applies to AFs and LAFs that are required to obtain an\nattestation report pursuant to Item 1506(a). It does not apply if an AF or LAF is not required to\ndisclose its GHG emissions (and therefore is not required to obtain an attestation report) because\nthe AF or LAF determines that its GHG emissions are not material for a particular fiscal year. In\naddition, for the avoidance of doubt, Item 1506(d)(2) does not apply to registrants that\nvoluntarily obtain assurance over their GHG emissions disclosure and provide certain\ninformation about the engagement pursuant to Item 1506(e). We expect that the documentation\nregarding resignations and dismissals and any disagreements between the registrant and the GHG\nemissions attestation provider will be readily available to the registrant such that it would not be\ndifficult or costly to comply with this requirement.\n5. Disclosure of Voluntary Assurance (Item 1506(e))\na. Proposed Rules\nThe Commission proposed to require a registrant that was not required to include a GHG\nemissions attestation report under the proposed rules to disclose certain information if the\nregistrant\u2019s GHG emissions disclosures were voluntarily subjected to third-party attestation or\nverification.1568 Specifically, the Commission proposed new Item 1505(e) of Regulation S-K to\nrequire a registrant to disclose within the separately captioned \u201cClimate-Related Disclosure\u201d\nsection in the filing the following information if the registrant\u2019s GHG emissions disclosures were\nsubject to third-party attestation or verification:\n(i) Identify the provider of such assurance or verification;\n(ii) Describe the assurance or verification standard used;\n1568 See Proposing Release, section II.H.5.\n370\n\n(iii) Describe the level and scope of assurance or verification provided;\n(iv) Briefly describe the results of the assurance or verification;\n(v) Disclose whether the third-party service provider has any other business\nrelationships with or has provided any other professional services to the registrant\nthat may lead to an impairment of the service provider\u2019s independence with\nrespect to the registrant; and\n(vi) Disclose any oversight inspection program to which the service provider is\nsubject (e.g., the AICPA\u2019s peer review program).1569\nThe Commission explained that, taken together, these proposed disclosure items should\nhelp investors understand the nature and reliability of the attestation or verification provided and\nhelp them assess whether the voluntary assurance or verification has enhanced the reliability of\nthe GHG emissions disclosure.1570\nb. Comments\nMany of the commenters that specifically addressed the proposed requirement to provide\ndisclosures regarding voluntary attestation or verification supported the proposal.1571 One\ncommenter stated, \u201c[i]f a registrant receives assurance for their GHG emissions, regardless of\nwhether they are required to do so under the final [Commission] rule, they should be required to\ndisclose this information . . . as proposed.\u201d1572 Alternatively, one commenter stated that\nregistrants that obtained voluntary assurance should follow the same proposed attestation\nrequirements that would apply to mandatory assurance over Scope 1 and Scope 2 disclosures\n1569 See id.\n1570 See id.\n1571 See, e.g., letters from Amer. for Fin. Reform, Sunrise Project et al.; CEMEX; C. Howard; and CII.\n1572 See letter from Amer. for Fin. Reform, Sunrise Project et al.\n371\n\n(e.g., proposed Items 1505(a) through (d)) to protect investors from attestation reports provided\nunder standards that did not meet a minimum set of criteria established by the Commission.1573\nSeveral commenters supported the proposed requirements to: identify the provider of\nsuch assurance or verification; disclose the assurance or verification standard used; describe the\nlevel and scope of assurance or verification provided; and briefly describe the results of the\nassurance or verification.1574 A few commenters supported the proposed requirement to disclose\nwhether the third-party service provider had any other business relationships with or has\nprovided any other professional services to the registrant that may lead to an impairment of the\nservice provider\u2019s independence with respect to the registrant.1575 However, one commenter\nstated that it did not support such a disclosure requirement because it did \u201cnot believe the third-\nparty provider should be independent.\u201d1576 A few commenters supported the requirement to\ndisclose any oversight program to which the service provider is subject,1577 while one commenter\nsuggested aligning with the Science Based Targets Initiative.1578 One commenter stated that it\ndid not support requiring attestation providers to disclose any oversight inspection programs to\nwhich they are subject because investors could, in its view, wrongly assume that attestation\n1573 See letter from KPMG.\n1574 See, e.g., letters from Amer. for Fin.

Science Based Targets Initiative (\u201cSBTi\u201d) is a partnership between CDP,\nthe United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute, and the World Wide Fund for Nature,\nwhich seeks to define and promote best practices in emissions reductions and net zero targets in line with\nclimate science, among other objectives. See SBTi, Who We Are/What We Do, available at\nhttps://sciencebasedtargets.org/about-us.\n372\n\nproviders that are subject to oversight are necessarily more qualified than those that are not.1579\nOne commenter stated it is not clear what any oversight inspection program would include.1580\nThe Proposing Release included a request for comment asking whether registrants should\nbe required to furnish a copy of, or provide a link to, the assurance or verification report.1581\nOne commenter stated that registrants should be asked to provide a copy of the attestation or\nverification report when available.1582 Another commenter stated that if summarizing the report\nin accordance with proposed Item 1505(e) effectively means that the report is filed, then\nfurnishing the report would, in the commenter\u2019s view, be a more appropriate alternative.1583 The\nProposing Release also asked whether, instead of requiring a registrant to disclose whether the\nthird-party service provider has any other business relationships with or has provided any other\nprofessional services to the registrant that may lead to an impairment of the service provider\u2019s\nindependence with respect to the registrant as proposed, the Commission should require the\nthird-party service provider to be independent, according to the standard proposed under Item\n1505(b) with respect to mandatory attestation over Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.1584 In\nresponse, one commenter stated that it supported such a requirement,1585 and one commenter\nstated that it did not support such a requirement, explaining that it would severely narrow the\noptions registrants have to hire such providers.1586 Finally, some commenters requested\n1579 See letter from Futurepast.\n1580 See letters from IECA. But see letter from CEMEX (stating that \u201cthe oversight inspection program is\nclear\u201d).\n1581 See Proposing Release, section II.H.5.\n1582 See letter from CEMEX.\n1583 See letter from KPMG.\n1584 See Proposing Release, section II.H.5.\n1585 See letter from Futurepast.\n1586 See letter from CEMEX.\n373\n\nclarification on the use of the terminology \u201cassurance\u201d and \u201cverification,\u201d and the difference\nbetween the two.1587\nc. Final Rules\nWe are adopting final rules (Item 1506(e)) that require any registrant that is not required\nto include a GHG emissions attestation report pursuant to Item 1506(a) to disclose certain\ninformation about the assurance engagement if the registrant\u2019s GHG emissions disclosure was\nvoluntarily subject to assurance.1588 Under the final rules, a registrant will be required to\ndisclose the following information if the registrant\u2019s GHG emissions disclosure was subject to\nthird-party assurance:\n(i) Identification of the service provider of such assurance;\n(ii) Description of the assurance standard used;\n(iii) Description of the level and scope of assurance services provided;\n(iv) Brief description of the results of the assurance services;\n(v) Whether the service provider has any material business relationships with or has\nprovided any material professional services to the registrant; and\n1587 See, e.g., letters from CEMEX; C. Howard; and IECA.\n1588 See 17 CFR 229.1506(e). Under the proposed rules, all registrants would have been subject to the\nrequirement to disclose Scopes 1 and 2 emissions, but only AFs and LAFs would have been subject to the\nproposed requirement to obtain attestation. Therefore, under the proposed rules, there would have been a\ncategory of registrants that were required to disclose GHG emissions in their filings but were not required\nto obtain an attestation report. The situation is different under the final rules because only AFs and LAFs\nare required to disclose Scopes 1 and/or 2 emissions in certain circumstances, and these categories of\nregistrants are also required to obtain an attestation report. Thus, under the final rules, there is no category\nof registrants that is required to disclose GHG emissions but not obtain an attestation report. As a result,\nItem 1506(e), which requires disclosure of voluntary assurance, only applies to (i) non-AF and non-LAF\nregistrants that voluntarily disclose their GHG emissions in a Commission filing and voluntarily obtain\nassurance over such disclosure; and (ii) as explained above in section II.I.1, filings made by AFs and LAFs\nafter the compliance date for the GHG emissions disclosure requirements but before Item 1506(a) requires\nlimited assurance.\n374\n\n(vi) Whether the service provider is subject to any oversight inspection program, and if\nso, which program (or programs) and whether the assurance services over GHG\nemissions are included within the scope of authority of such oversight inspection\nprogram.1589\nThe final rules require disclosure of this information whenever assurance services are\nvoluntarily obtained by the registrant. Although we considered requiring a registrant to provide\ndisclosure only when the registrant chooses to disclose the results of the assurance services, we\ndecided not to adopt this alternative because it could incentivize a registrant not to disclose\nunfavorable results from voluntary assurance services when that information would be\nmeaningful to an investor evaluating the reliability of a registrant\u2019s GHG emissions disclosure.\nIf a registrant chooses to voluntarily obtain assurance over its GHG emissions disclosure, it is\nimportant that investors be made aware of the fact that assurance was obtained, the nature of the\nservices provided, and the results of those assurance services so that they can evaluate how much\nreliance to place upon the disclosed GHG emissions data when making investment decisions.\nAlthough the proposed rules would have required a registrant to disclose certain\ninformation if its GHG emissions disclosure was voluntarily subject to third-party \u201cattestation\u201d\nor \u201cverification,\u201d the final rules are narrower in scope in that they only require a registrant to\ndisclose certain information about \u201cassurance\u201d services a registrant voluntarily obtains over its\nGHG emissions disclosure.1590 For purposes of the final rules, assurance services are services\nperformed in accordance with professional standards that are designed to provide assurance,\nwhich would include, for example, an examination providing reasonable assurance or a review\n1589 See 17 CFR 229.1506(e).\n1590 See id.\n375\n\nproviding limited assurance.1591 Certain \u201cattestation\u201d engagements may be designed to provide\nlimited or reasonable assurance over identified information and therefore such services would\nfall within the scope of the final rules, but in many cases \u201cverification\u201d services are not designed\nto provide assurance. In contrast to assurance services, non-assurance services are services that\nare not designed to provide assurance, which would include, for example, agreed upon\nprocedures engagements and, as indicated above, in many cases, verification engagements.1592\nWe have decided to focus the final rules on requiring disclosure of assurance services\nbecause investors are likely to place greater reliance on GHG emissions disclosure that has been\nsubject to assurance than disclosure that has not been subject to assurance.1593 Current voluntary\n1591 For examples of attestation engagements designed to provide assurance, see, e.g., PCAOB AT section 101;\nAICPA SSAE No. 21 AT-C sections 205and 206 and AICPA SSAE No. 22 AT-C section 210; and IAASB\nISAE 3000 (Revised) and ISAE 3410. See also Proposed ISSA 5000. The Proposing Release discussed\nthe differences between limited and reasonable assurance. See Proposing Release, section II.H.1.\n1592 For examples of engagements that are not designed to provide assurance, see, e.g., PCAOB AT section\n201, Agreed-Upon Procedures Engagements, available at\nhttps://pcaobus.org/oversight/standards/attestation-standards/details/AT201; AICPA SSAE No. 19 AT-C\nsection 215, Agreed-Upon Procedures Engagements, available at\nhttps://us.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/research/standards/auditattest/downloadabledocuments/at-c-\n00215.pdf; and IAASB International Standard on Related Services 4400 (Revised) Agreed-Upon\nProcedures Engagements, available at https://www.iaasb.org/_flysystem/azure-\nprivate/publications/files/ISRS-4400-Revised-Agreed-Upon-Procedures-final.pdf. It is possible that a\nservice identified or described as a \u201cverification\u201d could be designed to provide assurance (either limited or\nreasonable). See, e.g., ISO 14064-3 (defining \u201creasonable assurance\u201d as the \u201clevel of assurance where the\nnature and extent of the verification activities have been designed to provide a high but not absolute level\nof assurance on historical data and information\u201d and \u201climited assurance\u201d as the \u201clevel of assurance where\nthe nature and extent of the verification activities have been designed to provide a reduced level of\nassurance on historical data and information) (emphasis added). The key factor for purposes of\ndetermining whether disclosure is necessary under Item 1506(e) is whether the third-party services are\ndesigned to provide assurance.\n1593 A number of commenters on the proposed mandatory attestation requirements stated that they supported\nthe proposal because it would help increase the reliability of the disclosure. See supra note 1106 and\naccompanying text. Relatedly, academic research suggests that investors prefer audited to non-audited\ninformation. See J. Cohen, et al., Retail investors\u2019 perceptions of the decision-usefulness of economic\nperformance, governance, and corporate social responsibility disclosures, 23(1) Behavioral Research in\nAccounting 127 (2011) (\u201cAuditing appears to be of use in lending credibility to the disclosure of\nnonfinancial information, in the view of most respondents.\u201d); F.D. Hodge, Investors\u2019 perceptions of\nearnings quality, auditor independence, and the usefulness of audited financial statements, 17 Accounting\nHorizons-Supplement 42 (2003) (\u201cRetail investors recognize the agency problems related to their\n376\n\nESG assurance practices have been varied with respect to the levels of assurance provided (e.g.,\nlimited versus reasonable), the assurance standards used, the types of service providers, and the\nscope of disclosure covered by the assurance.1594 Therefore, we believe it is appropriate to\nrequire registrants to provide investors with some basic information about the assurance services\nvoluntarily obtained to help them understand the nature of the services provided and to help\ninvestors determine whether the assurance services have enhanced the reliability of the GHG\nemission disclosure. Similarly, requiring a brief description of the results of the voluntary\nassurance services will provide transparency about the reliability of any disclosed GHG\nemissions data, which in turn will help investors weigh how much importance to give that data\nwhen making investment decisions. Since non-assurance services are not designed to provide\nassurance, they do not connote the same degree of reliability as assurance services. Based on our\nexperience, investors likely do not rely upon non-assurance services to the same degree as\nassurance services. Therefore, the final rules will not require a registrant to provide Item 1506(e)\ninformation about any voluntary non-assurance services (e.g., agreed upon procedures) obtained\ninvestment and prefer audited financial information because of that.\u201d). A financial statement audit is a type\nof \u201creasonable assurance\u201d engagement. See, e.g., PCAOB AS 1015, Due Professional Care in the\nPerformance of Work, paragraph 10, available at https://pcaobus.org/oversight/standards/auditing-\nstandards/details/AS1015.\n1594 See Proposing Release, section II.H.1. The Commission explained in the Proposing Release that this\nfragmentation has diminished the comparability of assurance provided and may require investors to become\nfamiliar with many different assurance standards and the varying benefits of different levels of assurance.\nSee id. For example, investors may see that a service provider has produced an assurance report for a\nregistrant\u2019s GHG emissions disclosure and have an expectation that such assurance will enhance the\nreliability of the disclosure, without always understanding, for example, what level of assurance (e.g.,\nlimited versus reasonable) is being provided or what scope of assurance (e.g., the disclosure covered by the\nassurance) is being provided with respect to the registrant\u2019s GHG emissions disclosure. See id. As noted\nabove, the consequences of such fragmentation have also been highlighted by certain international\norganizations, including IOSCO. See supra note 1089 and accompanying text.\n377\n\nover its GHG emissions disclosure to avoid the potential for confusion.1595 Finally, we think\nthese changes to the final rules respond to several commenters who requested that the\nCommission clarify the terminology \u201cassurance\u201d and \u201cverification\u201d and the differences between\nthe two.1596\nTo the extent that registrants voluntarily provide more disclosure to investors than what is\nrequired under Item 1506(e), registrants should remain cognizant of their obligation to provide\ninvestors with truthful and accurate information and to avoid making any materially misleading\nstatements or omissions.1597 Importantly, this includes ensuring that any description or\ncharacterization of any assurance or any other type of services obtained with respect to GHG\nemissions disclosure is accurate.\nConsistent with the general support expressed by commenters, registrants are required to\ndisclose each of the proposed categories of information in the final rules with respect to\nvoluntary assurance services with some minor modifications.1598 The final rules require\n1595 One commenter, which supported requiring mandatory attestation over Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions for\nAFs and LAFs as proposed, expressed concerns that, among other things, \u201cinconsistencies in the nature and\nextent of procedures performed in voluntary attestation may detract from the benefits of the required\nattestations\u201d and also stated that \u201c[d]isclosing that the data was \u2018verified\u2019 would compound the confusion.\u201d\nSee letter from PwC. This commenter\u2019s proposed solution was to subject any attestation \u2013 voluntary or\nrequired \u2013 to the proposed requirements that applied to the proposed mandatory attestation requirements.\nAlthough we are not adopting this commenter\u2019s recommendation, we think the approach we are taking in\nthe final rules to require disclosure of certain information about assurance services voluntarily obtained by\na registrant will reduce the potential for confusion while providing investors with information to help them\nevaluate whether the assurance services have enhanced the reliability of the GHG emissions disclosure.\n1596 See supra note 1587 and accompanying text.\n1597 See, e.g., Securities Act section 17(a) [15 U.S.C. 77q(a)], Exchange Act section 10(b) [15 U.S.C. 78j(b)],\nand Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 [17 CFR 240.10b-5].\n1598 See 17 CFR 229.1506(e). In the Proposing Release, the Commission included a request for comment\nasking if registrants should be required to disclose the voluntary assurance or verification fees associated\nwith the GHG emissions disclosure. One commenter responded to the request for comment and stated that\nit believed requiring the disclosure of such fees is unnecessary because the disclosure would not be useful\nfor investors and would burden registrants. See letter from CEMEX. We have decided not to require the\ndisclosure of voluntary assurance fees and instead focus on requiring the disclosure of the general\ncategories of information specified in the final rules, which will be most useful to investors.\n378\n\nregistrants to identify the provider of such assurance services.1599 The identity of the assurance\nprovider is a basic, but important, piece of information for investors, particularly considering the\nbroad spectrum of providers that may provide assurance services (e.g., public accounting firms\nregistered with the PCAOB, unregistered public accounting firms, and potentially other types of\nservice providers).\nIf voluntary assurance services are obtained, the final rules also require registrants to\ndisclose the assurance standard used.1600 As noted above, the assurance landscape is currently\nevolving and there is diversity in practice.1601 Identification of the assurance standard would\nenable investors to better understand the service that has been provided and to assess whether the\nstandard is sufficiently developed, which may be particularly important given that some service\nproviders may use standards that are developed by accreditation bodies with notice and public\ncomment and other robust due processes for standard setting in the public interest, while other\nservice providers may use standards that do not have these characteristics.\nIn addition, if voluntary assurance services are obtained, the final rules require registrants\nto describe the level and scope of assurance provided and to briefly describe the results of the\nassurance services.1602 Registrants must clearly identify the level of assurance provided.\nIdentifying the scope of the assurance provided will help investors understand whether the scope\nof the engagement aligns with the scope of the registrant\u2019s GHG emissions disclosure (e.g.,\n1599 See 17 CFR 229.1506(e)(1).\n1600 See 17 CFR 229.1506(e)(2). See also supra note 1591 and accompanying text (citing examples of\nattestation engagements providing assurance and applicable standards).\n1601 See, e.g., CAQ, S&P 500 and ESG Reporting (Updated June 2023) (pointing to the use of assurance\nmethodologies such as AICPA AT-C 205, Assertion-Based Examination Engagements, AICPA AT-C 210,\nReview Engagements; and IAASB ISAE 3000 (Revised), and ISAE 3410, Assurance Engagements on\nGreenhouse Gas Statements).\n1602 See 17 CFR 229.1506(e)(3), (4).\n379\n\nScope 1 or 2). Providing investors with clear and transparent disclosure about the level and\nscope of assurance obtained is necessary to help investors weigh the level of reliance they should\nplace on assurance services and determine whether the assurance services have enhanced the\nreliability of the GHG emissions disclosure. In addition, as noted above, requiring disclosure of\nthe results of the assurance will provide transparency about the reliability of any disclosed GHG\nemissions data so that investors can weigh how much importance to give that data when making\ninvestment decisions.\nAs explained above, with respect to voluntary assurance, the proposed rules would have\nrequired a registrant to disclose whether the third-party service provider has any other business\nrelationships with or has provided any other professional services to the registrant that may lead\nto an impairment of the service provider\u2019s independence with respect to the registrant.1603 In a\nmodification to the proposed rules, Item 1506(e)(5) requires a registrant to disclose whether the\nservice provider has any material business relationships with or has provided any material\nprofessional services to the registrant.1604 We have decided not to adopt the requirement for a\nregistrant to determine whether any business relationships or other professional services \u201cmay\nlead to an impairment of the service provider\u2019s independence\u201d (emphasis added) because of the\nvariety of independence standards that could apply to the services. The assurance standard\ndictates the requirements for independence for engagements conducted in accordance with the\nstandard. The final rules do not prescribe a particular assurance standard that third-party service\n1603 See Proposing Release, section II.H.5.\n1604 See 17 CFR 229.1506(e)(5). A GHG emissions assurance engagement, by itself, does not trigger the\nrequirement to provide disclosure under Item 1506(e)(5).\n380\n\nproviders must use with respect to the disclosure required under Item 1506(e).1605 This could\nresult in registrants and third-party providers applying different standards, which may not be\napparent to investors and could reduce comparability. The modifications we have made in the\nfinal rules, however, will help avoid potential confusion and will enhance transparency related to\nthe independence and objectivity of the third-party service provider by requiring registrants to\ndisclose material business relationships and material professional services while also disclosing\nthe assurance standard used by the service provider.1606 Accordingly, the final rules serve much\nthe same purpose as the proposed rules; namely, providing investors with information to evaluate\nthe impartiality and objectivity of the service provider, which will in turn enable investors to\ndetermine whether the voluntary assurance services have enhanced the reliability of the GHG\nemissions disclosure. We continue to believe that assurance of GHG emissions disclosure by\nindependent assurance providers improves the reliability of, and investor confidence in, such\ndisclosure.1607\nOne commenter recommended that the Commission require a provider to be independent\ninstead of simply requiring disclosure of the relevant facts;1608 however, in keeping with the\napproach we are taking in the final rules with respect to voluntary assurance, which is focused on\nrequiring the disclosure of information regarding the voluntary assurance services provided\nrather than imposing requirements addressing what the services must entail, the final rules\n1605 For examples of independence standards, see, e.g., PCAOB Ethics and Independence Rules and Standards;\nAICPA Code of Professional Conduct; and International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA)\nInternational Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence\nStandards).\n1606 See 17 CFR 229.1506(e)(2), (5).\n1607 See Proposing Release, sections II.H.2 and II.H.5.\n1608 See letter from Futurepast.\n381\n\nrequire registrants to provide disclosure of material business relationships or other material\nprofessional services and the assurance standard used to enable investors to determine how much\nreliance to place on the assurance services.1609\nConsistent with the proposed rules, the final rules require registrants to disclose any\noversight inspection program to which the service provider is subject.1610 This is the same\nrequirement that applies to AFs and LAFs in Item 1506(d). As we explained in the discussion of\nItem 1506(d) in section II.I.4 above, the requirement to disclose any oversight inspection\nprogram to which the service provider is subject is not limited to oversight inspection programs\nthat include within their scope, or require the inspection of, the assurance services provided for\nthe GHG emissions disclosure. Rather, the final rules require the disclosure of \u201cany\u201d oversight\ninspection program, which includes any oversight program the service provider is subject to for\nany type of engagement (e.g., a financial statement audit or other review).1611 Examples of such\noversight inspection programs include the AICPA\u2019s peer review program and the PCAOB\u2019s\ninspection program.1612 As explained in section II.I.4 above, this information will help investors\nbetter understand the qualifications of an assurance provider, which in turn will help them\ndetermine whether the assurance services have enhanced the reliability of the GHG emissions\ndisclosure.1613\n1609 See 17 CFR 229.1506(e)(2), (5).\n1610 See 17 CFR 229.1506(e)(6).\n1611 See id.\n1612 See id. The PCAOB\u2019s oversight inspection program is another non-exhaustive example of an oversight\ninspection program that would fall within the scope of the required disclosure, which, along with the\nadditional explanation we are providing, will help clarify this requirement for commenters. See supra note\n1580 and accompanying text.\n1613 As stated above in section II.I.4, this is true even in circumstances where the oversight inspection program\ndoes not include within its scope the assurance services for the GHG emissions disclosure because such\noversight can provide a check on a provider\u2019s overall activities and drive improvements in the quality of\ntheir services overall. See supra note 1555 and accompanying text.\n382\n\nHowever, to provide investors with a more complete understanding of such oversight\ninspection program, in a modification to the proposed rules, the final rules also require a\nregistrant to disclose whether such oversight inspection program includes within its scope the\nassurance services over GHG emissions disclosure obtained by the registrant.1614 Again, this is\nthe same requirement that applies to AFs and LAFs in Item 1506(d). As explained above, we\nwould consider assurance services over GHG emissions disclosure to be within the scope of an\noversight inspection program if it is possible for the assurance services to be inspected pursuant\nto the oversight program, even if it is not certain that the services will be inspected in a particular\ninspection cycle. Requiring registrants to disclose the existence of an oversight inspection\nprogram provides investors with valuable information about the qualifications of a GHG\nemissions attestation provider regardless of whether the oversight inspection program includes\nthe inspection of assurance over GHG emissions disclosure within its scope. Similarly, requiring\ndisclosure of whether the GHG emission assurance services would fall within the scope of such\nprogram would further facilitate investors\u2019 evaluation of the reliability of the assurance results\nand GHG emissions disclosure.1615 One commenter stated that the Commission should not\nrequire the disclosure of oversight inspection programs because it could wrongly suggest that\nattestation providers that are subject to oversight are necessarily more qualified than those that\nare not.1616 We agree with the commenter that it is not necessarily true that an assurance\n1614 See 17 CFR 229.1506(e)(6).\n1615 The PCAOB\u2019s inspection jurisdiction is limited to audits of issuers and broker-dealers registered with the\nCommission and would not include engagements for the assurance of GHG emissions disclosures within its\nscope. See supra note 1357. However, as stated in the Proposing Release, an example of an oversight\ninspection program that includes within its scope assurance engagements is the AICPA peer review\nprogram. See Proposing Release, section II.H.4.\n1616 See letter from Futurepast.\n383\n\nprovider that is subject to oversight is more qualified than a provider that is not.1617 But whether\na provider is subject to oversight is one relevant factor for investors to consider when assessing\nthe reliability of assurance results and GHG emissions disclosure and such oversight can provide\na check on a provider\u2019s activities and drive improvements in quality as explained above.\nThe proposed rules would have required a registrant to include the proposed disclosure\nregarding voluntary attestation within the separately captioned \u201cClimate-Related Disclosure\u201d\nsection in the Commission filing where the GHG emissions data is disclosed.1618 Since the final\nrules leave the placement of climate-related disclosures, other than the financial statement\ndisclosures, largely up to the registrant, a registrant will not be required to include the disclosure\nregarding voluntary assurance within a separately captioned \u201cClimate-Related Disclosure\u201d\nsection in the Commission filing.1619 Rather, registrants should provide the disclosure required\nby this section in the same Commission filing and alongside the GHG emissions disclosure to\nwhich the voluntary assurance services relate.\nUnder the final rules, a registrant is responsible for disclosing the required information\nabout the voluntary assurance services in its Commission filings. In these circumstances, we do\nnot view the assurance provider as having prepared or certified the filing or any information\ncontained therein. In addition, Item 1506(e) will not require registrants to file or furnish any\nvoluntary assurance reports to the Commission.\nAlthough the final rules do not require a registrant that has obtained voluntary assurance\nover its GHG emissions disclosure to file or furnish an assurance report to the Commission, for\n1617 See supra note 1579.\n1618 See Proposing Release, section II.H.5.\n1619 See supra section II.A.3.\n384\n\nthe avoidance of doubt, and in response to commenters,1620 we are amending Rule 436 to provide\nthat any description of assurance services regarding a registrant\u2019s GHG emissions disclosure\nprovided in accordance with Item 1506(e) of Regulation S-K will not be considered a part of the\nregistration statement prepared or certified by an expert or person whose profession gives\nauthority to the statements made within the meaning of sections 7 and 11 of the Securities\nAct.1621 Therefore, a registrant is not required to obtain and include the written consent of the\nGHG emissions attestation provider pursuant to Securities Act section 7 or Rule 436.1622 Even\nthough we believe that accountability for experts under section 11 is a central tenet of the\nSecurities Act,1623 this limited exception should encourage registrants to voluntarily obtain\nassurance over their GHG emission disclosure, which will benefit investors because assurance\nhelps to enhance the reliability of a registrant\u2019s GHG emissions disclosure.\nAs discussed above in section II.I.2.c, we are also amending Rule 436 to provide that a\nreport by a GHG emissions attestation provider covering Scope 1, Scope 2, and/or Scope 3\nemissions at a limited assurance level shall not be considered a part of the registrant statement\nthat is prepared or certified by an expert or person whose profession gives authority to the\n1620 See supra note 1345 and accompanying text.\n1621 See 17 CFR 230.436(i)(2).\n1622 See 15 U.S.C. 77g; 17 CFR 230.436. For the avoidance of doubt, a registrant would not have to obtain and\ninclude the written consent of the GHG emissions attestation provider pursuant to 17 CFR 229.601(b)(23),\nwhich is the Regulation S-K provision requiring a registrant to file the written consent of an expert as an\nexhibit to a Securities Act registration statement or Exchange Act report that incorporates by reference a\nwritten expert report attached to a previously filed Securities Act registration statement.\n1623 See 15 U.S.C. 77k(a)(4).

In these circumstances, a registrant would be required to submit a letter from\nthe GHG emissions attestation provider that acknowledges their awareness of the use in certain\nregistration statements of any of their reports which are not subject to the consent requirement of\nsection 7 pursuant to the amendments to Item 601 of Regulation S-K.1625 However, if a\nregistrant voluntarily chooses to file or furnish an assurance report to the Commission that does\nnot meet the requirements of Rule 436(i)(1) (e.g., the assurance report is provided at a reasonable\nassurance level), or if the registrant chooses to voluntarily disclose more information than is\nrequired under Item 1506(e) of Regulation S-K, then, by its terms, the exception in Rule 436\nwould not apply, and the assurance provider may be required to provide a consent in accordance\nwith applicable statutory provisions and rules and would be subject to Section 11 liability.1626\nJ. Safe Harbor for Certain Climate-Related Disclosures (Item 1507)\n1. Proposed Rules\nThe Commission proposed a safe harbor for Scope 3 emissions data to mitigate potential\nliability concerns that registrants may have about providing emissions information derived\n1624 See 17 CFR 230.436(i)(1).\n1625 See 17 CFR 229.601(b)(27). See also supra section II.I.2.c. for further discussion of the amendments to\nItem 601 of Regulation S-K.\n1626 Although the amendments to Rule 436 will clarify that assurance providers will not be liable to\nshareholders in actions under section 11 of the Securities Act (to the extent the provider qualifies for the\nexception), we remind registrants and providers that there are other remedies available to shareholders and\nthe Commission, such as section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, which are not\naffected by the amendments to Rule 436.\n386\n\nlargely from third parties in a registrant\u2019s value chain. The proposed safe harbor provided that\ndisclosure of Scope 3 emissions by or on behalf of the registrant would be deemed not to be a\nfraudulent statement unless it is shown that such statement was made or reaffirmed without a\nreasonable basis or was disclosed other than in good faith.1627 As proposed, the safe harbor\nwould extend to any statement regarding Scope 3 emissions that is disclosed pursuant to\nproposed Items 1500 through 1506 of Regulation S-K and made in a document filed with the\nCommission. For purposes of the proposed safe harbor, the term \u201cfraudulent statement\u201d was\ndefined to mean a statement that is an untrue statement of material fact, a statement false or\nmisleading with respect to any material fact, an omission to state a material fact necessary to\nmake a statement not misleading, or that constitutes the employment of a manipulative,\ndeceptive, or fraudulent device, contrivance, scheme, transaction, act, practice, course of\nbusiness, or an artifice to defraud as those terms are used in the Securities Act or the Exchange\nAct or the rules or regulations promulgated thereunder.1628\nAlthough the proposed safe harbor only applied to Scope 3 emissions disclosures, the\nCommission solicited comment on whether the safe harbor should apply to other climate-related\ndisclosures, such as Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosures, any targets and goals disclosures, or\nthe proposed financial statement metrics disclosures.1629 The Commission also solicited\ncomment on whether to provide a safe harbor for disclosures related to a registrant\u2019s use of\ninternal carbon pricing, scenario analysis,1630 and a transition plan.1631 The Commission further\n1627 See Proposing Release, section II.G.3.\n1628 See id.\n1629 See id.\n1630 See Proposing Release, section II.C.\n1631 See Proposing Release, section II.E.2.\n387\n\nrequested comment on whether it should adopt a provision similar to 17 CFR 229.305(d) that\nwould apply the PSLRA safe harbors to forward-looking statements made in response to\nspecified climate-related disclosure items, such as proposed Item 1502 pertaining to impacts of\nclimate-related risks on strategy.1632 Finally, the Commission solicited comment on whether the\nsafe harbor should apply indefinitely or, instead, should sunset after the passage of a certain\nnumber of years or after certain conditions are satisfied.1633\n2. Comments\nSeveral commenters supported the adoption of a Scope 3 emissions safe harbor in the\nform proposed.1634 These commenters stated that the proposed safe harbor for Scope 3\nemissions disclosure was appropriate because of the uncertainties involved in the calculation of\nthose emissions due to the need to rely on estimates1635 and data from third parties.1636 Some of\nthese commenters also stated that the proposed safe harbor would encourage more robust\ndisclosure of a registrant\u2019s Scope 3 emissions.1637 A few commenters specifically supported\nbasing the Scope 3 emissions safe harbor on the proposed standard that a registrant\u2019s Scope 3\nemissions disclosure would not be deemed to be a fraudulent statement unless it is shown that\nsuch statement was made or reaffirmed without a reasonable basis or was disclosed other than in\ngood faith.1638\n1632 See Proposing Release, section II.C.\n1633 See Proposing Release, section II.G.3.\n1634 See, e.g., letters from CalPERS; Calvert; CEMEX; IAC Recommendation; Impax Asset Mgmt.; and\nTotalEnergies.\n1635 See, e.g., letters from CalPERS; Calvert; CEMEX; and TotalEnergies.\n1636 See, e.g., letters from CEMEX; Impax Asset Mgmt.; and TotalEnergies.\n1637 See, e.g., letters from PRI; and SKY Harbor.\n1638 See, e.g., letters from CEMEX; and TotalEnergies.\n388\n\nMany other commenters recommended strengthening and/or broadening the scope of the\nproposed safe harbor to include other types of climate-related disclosures.1639 In this regard\nseveral commenters stated that a more robust safe harbor for climate-related disclosures than\nwhat was proposed would encourage registrants to provide more robust and \u201chigher quality\u201d\ndisclosures for investors while the proposed safe harbor would potentially chill climate\nreporting.1640\nFor example, some commenters stated that the proposed Scope 3 emissions safe harbor\nappeared to be based on a negligence liability standard, which would provide protection that was\ntoo weak to be of much use for many registrants.1641 Some commenters recommended that the\nCommission remove the proposed \u201creasonable basis\u201d requirement, condition the safe harbor only\non a registrant acting in good faith when calculating and reporting its Scope 3 emissions, and, for\nloss of the safe harbor, require knowing or intentional fraud in the sense that the registrant must\nhave actual knowledge that the third-party information it is utilizing is unreliable.1642\nSome commenters, as well as the Commission\u2019s Small Business Capital Formation\nAdvisory Committee,1643 recommended adoption of a safe harbor that would cover any climate\n1639 See, e.g., letters from AALA; Airlines for America; Amer.

Final Rules\nBecause the final rules will not require the disclosure of Scope 3 emissions from any\nregistrant,1673 we are not adopting a safe harbor for such disclosures in the final rules. Instead,\nfor the reasons discussed below and consistent with the feedback from commenters that asked\nthe Commission to promulgate a safe harbor for certain climate-related disclosures (in addition\nto the Scope 3 emissions disclosure safe harbor that was proposed),1674 we are adopting a\nprovision (Item 1507) stating that disclosures (other than historic facts) provided pursuant to the\nfollowing subpart 1500 provisions constitute \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d for purposes of the\nPSLRA safe harbors:\n\u2022 17 CFR 229.1502(e) (transition plans);\n\u2022 17 CFR 229.1502(f) (scenario analysis);\n\u2022 17 CFR 229.1502(g) (internal carbon pricing); and\n\u2022 17 CFR 229.1504 (targets and goals).1675\nIn addition, as discussed in more detail below, the final rules provide that the PSLRA safe\nharbors will apply to these forward-looking statements in connection with certain transactions\nand disclosures by certain issuers notwithstanding that these transactions and issuers are\n1671 See letter from CEMEX.\n1672 See letter from AXPC.\n1673 See supra section II.H.3.\n1674 See supra note 1639 and accompanying text.\n1675 See 17 CFR 229.1507(a)(1).\n393\n\nexcluded from the PSLRA safe harbors in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of section 27A of the\nSecurities Act and section 21E of the Exchange Act.\nWhen proposing the climate disclosure rules, the Commission indicated that, because\ntransition planning, scenario analysis, and internal carbon pricing involve assumptions,\njudgments, and predictions about future events, the PSLRA safe harbors would be applicable to\nforward-looking statements concerning transition plans, scenario analysis, and internal carbon\npricing.1676 Moreover, because the proposed targets and goals disclosure provision would\nrequire a registrant to disclose how it intends to achieve its climate-related targets or goals, the\nCommission similarly stated that the PSLRA safe harbors would apply to forward-looking\nstatements made in the context of such targets and goals disclosure.1677 Because estimates and\nassumptions based on future events are intrinsically involved in disclosures concerning a\nregistrant\u2019s transition plan, use of scenario analysis or internal carbon pricing, and targets and\ngoals, we continue to believe that such disclosures constitute \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d for\npurposes of the PSLRA safe harbors.\nThe PSLRA statutory provisions define \u201cforward-looking statement\u201d to include a number\nof different types of statements.1678 Several of these definitional provisions are potentially\napplicable to statements made in the context of disclosures regarding transition plans, scenario\nanalysis, and internal carbon pricing made pursuant to Item 1502 and regarding targets and goals\nmade pursuant to Item 1504. To the extent that disclosures made in response to these Items or to\n1676 See Proposing Release, sections II.C and E.\n1677 See Proposing Release, section II.I.\n1678 See 15 U.S.C. 77z-2(i)(1) and 15 U.S.C. 78u-5(i)(1).\n394\n\nany other subpart 1500 provision contain one or more of the following statements, they will fall\nwithin the PSLRA statutory definition of \u201cforward-looking statement\u201d:\n\u2022 A statement containing a projection of revenues, income (including income loss),\nearnings (including earnings loss) per share, capital expenditures, capital structure, or\nother financial items;1679\n\u2022 A statement of the plans and objectives of management for future operations, including\nplans or objectives relating to the products or services of the issuer;1680\n\u2022 A statement of future economic performance, including any such statement contained in a\ndiscussion and analysis of financial condition by the management, made pursuant to\nCommission rules;1681\n\u2022 Any statement of the assumptions underlying or relating to the above statements;1682 and\n\u2022 A statement containing a projection or estimate of items specified by Commission rule or\nregulation.1683\nIf a forward-looking statement falls squarely within any of the above-described forward-\nlooking statements, certain parties may rely on the existing PSLRA safe harbors for disclosures\nmade pursuant to any of the subpart 1500 provisions, assuming the other requirements of the\n1679 See 15 U.S.C. 77z-2(i)(1)(A) and 15 U.S.C. 78u-5(i)(1)(A). For example, a statement of potential capital\nexpenditures made in response to Item 1502(e) (transition plans) and Item 1502(d) (narrative discussion of\nmaterial impacts of climate-related risks) would likely constitute a forward-looking statement.\n1680 See 15 U.S.C. 77z-2(i)(1)(B) and 15 U.S.C. 78u-5(i)(1)(B). For example, a statement of plans to transition\nto more efficient operations or a different mix of products or services made in response to Item 1502(d),\nItem 1502(e), or Item 1504 (targets and goals) would likely constitute a forward-looking statement.\n1681 See 15 U.S.C. 77z-2(i)(1)(C) and 15 U.S.C. 78u-5(i)(1)(C). For example, a statement of future economic\nperformance made pursuant to Items 1502(d), Item 1504, or Item 303 of Regulation S-K would likely\nconstitute a forward-looking statement.\n1682 See 15 U.S.C. 77z-2(i)(1)(D) and 15 U.S.C. 78u-5(i)(1)(D).\n1683 See 15 U.S.C. 77z-2(i)(1)(F) and 15 U.S.C. 78u-5(i)(1)(F). For example, a projection or estimate of a\nregistrant\u2019s future GHG emissions made pursuant to Item 1504 would likely constitute a forward-looking\nstatement.\n395\n\nPSLRA provisions are met.1684 We recognize, however, the concern of some commenters that\nthe PSLRA safe harbors may not be applicable to disclosures related to transition plans, scenario\nanalysis, internal carbon price, and targets and goals to the extent the disclosures consist of a\ncomplex mix of factual and forward-looking statements and because the PSLRA safe harbors do\nnot apply to certain parties and certain transactions.1685\nIn addition to the forward-looking statement exemptions expressly provided under the\nPSLRA, the Commission has authority under the PSLRA to provide exemptions from liability\nfor other statements based on projections or other forward-looking information if the\nCommission determines that such exemption is consistent with the public interest and the\nprotection of investors.1686 The Commission previously exercised this authority when it adopted\na rule providing a forward-looking statement safe harbor for certain statements made concerning\nmarket risk.1687\nAfter considering feedback from commenters, we have concluded that using the authority\nprovided by the PSLRA to extend its protections to disclosures (other than historical facts)\nconcerning transition plans, scenario analysis, internal carbon pricing, and targets and goals is\nconsistent with the public interest and the protection of investors. We expect that the disclosures\n1684 Other safe harbors, such as Securities Act Rule 175 and Exchange Act Rule 3b-6 and the bespeaks caution\ndoctrine may also continue to apply to disclosures made pursuant to any of the subpart 1500 provisions,\ndepending on specific facts and circumstances.\n1685 See, e.g., letters from BOA; and Chamber. For example, the PSLRA safe harbors do not apply to\nstatements made in connection with an IPO, see 15 U.S.C. 77z-2(b)(2)(D) and 15 U.S.C. 78u-5(b)(2)(D), or\nmade in connection with an offering by, or related to the operations of, a partnership, limited liability\ncompany, or a direct participation investment program, see 15 U.S.C. 77z-2(b)(2)(E) and 15 U.S.C. 78u-\n5(b)(2)(E).\n1686 15 U.S.C. 77z-2(g) and 15 U.S.C. 78u-5(g). The PSLRA also provides that it does not limit, \u201ceither\nexpressly or by implication, the authority of the Commission to exercise similar authority or to adopt\nsimilar rules and regulations with respect to forward-looking statements under any other statute under\nwhich the Commission exercises rulemaking authority.\u201d 15 U.S.C. 77z-2(h) and 15 U.S.C. 78u-5(h).\n1687 17 CFR 229.305; see Disclosure of Market Risk Sensitive Instruments Release.\n396\n\nrequired by these items will include a complex mixture of both forward-looking and factual\ninformation related to climate-related risks and assumptions concerning those risks. Thus, we\nare providing a safe harbor for these disclosures to avoid having to disentangle the information to\nclaim protection for forward-looking statements under the PSLRA safe harbors, which would\nincrease the compliance burden under the final rules and potentially reduce the usefulness of\nthose disclosures for investors. We also believe that a safe harbor for these disclosures will help\nincentivize more comprehensive disclosures on these matters to the benefit of investors.1688\nStatements made by issuers and/or in connection with transactions1689 currently excluded\nfrom the PSLRA statutory safe harbor for forward-looking statements that will be eligible for the\nfinal rules\u2019 safe harbor include forward-looking statements: made in connection with an offering\nof securities by a blank check company;1690 made with respect to the business or operations of an\nissuer of penny stock; made in connection with a rollup transaction; or made in connection with\nan IPO,1691 or in connection with an offering by, or relating to the operations of, a partnership,\nlimited liability company, or a direct participation investment program.1692\n1688 See supra note 1640 and accompanying text.\n1689 In addition to issuers, consistent with the PSLRA safe harbors, the safe harbor will apply to: a person acting\non behalf of the issuer; an outside reviewer retained by the issuer making a statement on behalf of the\nissuer; or an underwriter, with respect to information provided by the issuer or information derived from\ninformation provided by the issuer. See 15 U.S.C. 77z-2(a)(2)-(4) and 15 U.S.C. 78u-5(a)(2)-(4); see also\ninfra note 1691.\n1690 The Commission recently amended Securities Act Rule 405 and Exchange Act Rule 12b-2 to define \u201cblank\ncheck company\u201d for purposes of Securities Act Section 27A and Exchange Act Section 21E to mean a\ncompany that has no specific business plan or purpose or has indicated that its business plan is to engage in\na merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or companies, or other entity or person. See Special\nPurpose Acquisition Companies, Shell Companies, and Projections, Release No. 33-11265 (Jan. 24, 2024),\n[89 FR 14158 (Feb. 26, 2024)].\n1691 The limitation in 15 U.S.C. 77z-2(a)(1) and 15 U.S.C. 78u-5(a)(1) is not applicable. See Item 1507(a)(3).\nThus, notwithstanding 15.U.S.C. 77z(2)(a)(1) and 15 U.S.C. 78(u)(a)(1), the safe harbor will apply where\nan issuer that, at the time the statement is made, is not subject to the reporting requirements of section 13(a)\nor section 15(d) of the Exchange Act.\n1692 See 17 CFR 229.1507(a)(2).\n397\n\nWe have determined that it is consistent with the public interest and the protection of\ninvestors to extend the safe harbor to these entities, such as partnerships and limited liability\ncompanies, and to transactions, such as IPOs, all of which are currently excluded from the\nPSLRA statutory safe harbor for forward-looking statements, because such entities may be\nsubject to material climate-related risks that will require them to provide the disclosures pursuant\nto Items 1502(e), (f), or (g), or Item 1504. Extending the PSLRA safe harbor to these specified\ndisclosures will encourage more comprehensive disclosures under these Items and help limit any\nnegative effects to capital formation that may result from the perceived compliance costs\nassociated with these provisions of the final rules.1693\nBecause the disclosure items pertaining to transition plans, scenario analysis, internal\ncarbon pricing, and targets and goals are likely to involve a complex mixture of estimates and\nassumptions, some of which may be based on a combination of facts and projections, the safe\nharbor we are adopting provides that all information required by the subpart 1500 provisions\nconcerning transition plans, scenario analysis, internal carbon pricing, and targets and goals is\nconsidered forward-looking statements for purposes of the statutory PSLRA safe harbors, except\nfor historical facts.1694 This provision should encourage more comprehensive disclosures\n1693 See 15 U.S.C. 77z-2(b)(1)(B)-(D) and 77z-2(b)(2)(C)-(E); and 15 U.S.C. 78u-5(b)(1)(B)-(D) and 78u-\n5(b)(2)(C)-(E). We are not using our exemptive authority to extend the PSLRA safe harbors to: (i) issuers\nspecified in Securities Act section 27A(b)(1)(A) and Exchange Act section 21E(b)(1)(A) (specified \u201cbad\nactors\u201d); (ii) forward looking-statements contained in a registration statement of, or otherwise issued by, an\ninvestment company as specified in Securities Act section 27A(b)(2)(B) and Exchange Act section\n21E(b)(2)(B); and (iii) forward-looking statements made by an issuer in a going-private transaction, see\nsection 27A(b)(1)(E) and Exchange Act section 21E(b)(1)(E), in connection with a tender offer, see\nSecurities Act section 27A(b)(2)(C) and Exchange Act section 21E(b)(2)(C), or in a beneficial ownership\nreport required to be filed pursuant to section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, see Securities Act section\n27A(b)(2)(F) and Exchange Act section 21E(b)(2)(F). See also the discussion below of forward-looking\nstatements made in consolidated financial statements, which are excluded from both the PSLRA and Item\n1507 safe harbors.\n1694 See 17 CFR 229.1507(b). The Commission adopted a similar provision in the market risk disclosure\ncontext. See 17 CFR 229.305(d)(2)(i).\n398\n\nregarding these subpart 1500 items, to the benefit of investors, despite their novelty and\ncomplexity.\nConsistent with the operation of the PSLRA safe harbor, the final rules\u2019 forward-looking\nsafe harbor will not be available for statements consisting solely of historical fact because such\ninformation does not involve the assumptions, judgments, and predictions about future events\nthat necessitates additional protections.1695 The safe harbor provision provides as non-exclusive\nexamples of historical facts that are excluded from the safe harbor information related to carbon\noffsets or RECs described pursuant to a target or goal and a registrant\u2019s statements in response to\nItem 1502(e) (transition plan disclosure) or Item 1504 (targets and goals disclosure) about\nmaterial expenditures actually incurred.1696 Like the terms of a material contract, parties covered\nby the safe harbor should know with reasonable certainty information about a purchased carbon\noffset or REC, such as the amount of carbon avoidance, reduction, or removal represented by the\noffset or the amount of generated renewable energy represented by the REC, as well as the\nnature and source of the offset or REC, and should not need the protection of a forward-looking\nsafe harbor if those items are required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 1504.1697 Similarly,\nstatements in response to Item 1502(e) (transition plan disclosure) and Item 1504 (targets and\ngoals disclosure) about material expenditures actually incurred will not be eligible for the Item\n1507 safe harbor because those statements consist of historical facts.\nThe PSLRA safe harbor does not apply to forward-looking statements included in\nfinancial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles\n1695 See 15 U.S.C. 77z-2(a) and 15 U.S.C. 78u-5(a).\n1696 See 17 CFR 229.1507(b).\n1697 See 17 CFR 229.1504(d).\n399\n\n(\u201cGAAP\u201d).1698 Consistent with this, the final rules\u2019 safe harbor will not be available for forward-\nlooking statements included in a registrant\u2019s consolidated financial statements. In addition, any\nsuch forward-looking statements that are incorporated by reference from the financial statements\ninto a registrant\u2019s subpart 1500 disclosures will not be eligible for the Item 1507 safe harbor.\nNotwithstanding deeming certain disclosures to be \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d and\nexpanding the PSLRA protections to include certain issuers and transactions under Item 1507,\nthe rest of the PSLRA requirements apply to the Item 1507 safe harbor. For example, in order\nfor the safe harbor protections to apply, a forward-looking statement must be accompanied by a\nmeaningful cautionary statement that identifies important factors that could cause actual results\nto differ materially from those in the forward-looking statement.1699\nAlthough some commenters asked the Commission to include Scopes 1 and 2 emissions\ndisclosures within the scope of any safe harbor, we decline to follow this recommendation.1700\nBecause the methodologies underlying the calculation of those scopes are fairly well-\nestablished,1701 we do not believe that it is necessary to provide a safe harbor from private\nlitigation for such disclosures. We also decline to extend the safe harbor to Commission\nenforcement actions because existing Securities Act Rule 175 and Exchange Act Rule 3b-6\nalready provide a suitable safe harbor from liability for forward-looking statements in certain\nCommission enforcement actions.1702\n1698 See 15 U.S.C. 77z-2(b)(2)(B) and 15 U.S.C. 78u-5(b)(2)(B).\n1699 See 15 U.S.C. 77z-2(c)(1)(A) and 15 U.S.C. 78u-5(c)(1)(A).\n1700 See supra note 1651 and accompanying text.\n1701 See, e.g., supra note 916 and accompanying text.\n1702 Securities Act Rule 175 and Exchange Act Rule 3b-6 also apply to private litigation.\n400"

The Commission may determine at a future date,\nafter assessing how disclosure practices have evolved, whether it makes sense to amend or\nremove the safe harbor.\nK. Financial Statement Effects (Article 14)\n1. Introduction\nThe Commission proposed amendments to Regulation S-X that would require certain\ndisclosures in registrants\u2019 financial statements. Specifically, the Commission proposed that if a\nregistrant is required to file the disclosure required by proposed subpart 1500 in a filing that also\nrequires audited financial statements, then the registrant would be required to disclose in a note\nto its financial statements certain disaggregated financial statement metrics.1704 The proposed\nrules would have required disclosure falling under three categories of information:\n\u2022 Financial Impact Metrics;1705\n\u2022 Expenditure Metrics; and\n\u2022 Financial Estimates and Assumptions.1706\nThe proposed Financial Impact Metrics would have required disclosure of the impacts of\nsevere weather events and other natural conditions and any efforts to reduce GHG emissions or\notherwise mitigate exposure to transition risks on the line items in a registrant\u2019s financial\n1703 See supra note 1664 and accompanying text.\n1704 See Proposing Release, section II.F.1.\n1705 The Proposing Release and the proposed rules used the term \u201cmetrics\u201d to describe the proposed Regulation\nS-X amendments, including the proposed Financial Impact Metrics and the proposed Expenditure Metrics.\nSee Proposing Release, section II.F. The final rules do not use the term \u201cmetrics\u201d to describe the\nRegulation S-X amendments because we think it is more accurate to characterize them as disclosures of\nfinancial statement effects. See 17 CFR 210.14-01, 14-02.\n1706 See Proposing Release, section II.F.1.\n401\n\nstatements.1707 Disclosure of the Financial Impact Metrics would have been required if the sum\nof the absolute value of all impacts on the line item was one percent or more of the total line item\nfor the relevant fiscal year.1708 The proposed Expenditure Metrics would have required\nregistrants to disclose expenditures expensed and costs incurred to mitigate risks related to the\nsame severe weather events and other natural conditions and transition activities.1709 Under the\nExpenditure Metrics, disclosure would have been required if the aggregate amount of\nexpenditures expensed or the aggregate amount of capitalized costs was one percent or more of\nthe total expenditure expensed or total capitalized costs incurred, respectively, for the relevant\nfiscal year.1710 In addition, the proposed rules would have required disclosure of Financial\nEstimates and Assumptions impacted by severe weather events and other natural conditions and\ntransition activities and would have permitted a registrant to include the impact of any\nopportunities arising from these events and activities on any of the financial metrics\ndisclosed.1711\nAlthough commenters\u2019 views were mixed, a number of commenters supported adoption\nof the proposed financial statement disclosure requirements.1712 Commenters stated that the\n1707 See Proposing Release, section II.F.2.\n1708 See id.\n1709 See Proposing Release, section II.F.3.\n1710 See id.\n1711 See Proposing Release, sections II.2, 3, and 4.\n1712 See, e.g., letters from Aron Cramer, BSR (May 31, 2022) (\u201cA.

For example, some commenters stated that in lieu of the proposed rules, the\nCommission should instead require registrants to discuss the impact of climate-related matters on\nthe registrant\u2019s financial position in Item 303 of Regulation S-K (i.e., MD&A).1724 Other\ncommenters stated that registrants are already required to disclose material climate-related\nimpacts in MD&A.1725 A number of commenters recommended that the Commission work with\nthe FASB to determine whether accounting standards should be developed to address climate-\nrelated financial statement disclosures or that the Commission should simply refer the\ndevelopment of standards to the FASB.1726 Other commenters stated that the Commission\nTreasurer of Missouri (June 17, 2022) (\u201cMO Treas.\u201d); MRC Global Inc (June 17, 2022) (\u201cMRC Global\u201d);\nRichard C.

We appreciate the significant concerns raised by commenters with respect to\nthe potential burdens resulting from the proposed financial statement disclosures, including the\nadjustments that registrants stated they would need to make to their controls, processes, and\naccounting records in order to comply with the proposed requirements.1730 Therefore, we are\nadopting rules that require registrants to provide decision-useful information to investors but that\nare significantly narrower in scope than the proposed rules, which should help to mitigate\nconcerns about the potential burdens of the disclosure.\nThe Commission is not adopting the proposed Financial Impact Metrics and is modifying\nthe scope of the proposed Expenditure Metrics and proposed Financial Estimates and\nFinancial Council (June 13, 2022) (\u201cCRE Fin. et al.\u201d); Davis Polk; Deutsche Bank; Etsy; IPA; MRC\nGlobal; Nareit; OPC; RILA; Shearman Sterling; SIFMA AMG; S.P.

See also letter from AICPA (stating that prescribing\naccounting principles requires a robust and transparent standard-setting process and advising the\nCommission to \u201cconsider whether it is ideally positioned to establish new accounting rules on this topic.\u201d).\n1727 See, e.g., letters from BIO; and EMC.\n1728 See, e.g., letters from AFEP (June 17, 2022); AHLA; McCormick; and BIO.\n1729 See, e.g., letters from ACLI; and Soros Fund (\u201cWhile we believe it is valuable for all companies to evaluate\nhow climate impacts and expenditures are tied to line items in their financial statements, we believe only\ncompanies in high emitting industries and large accelerated filers should be required to disclose the\nproposed financial statement metrics, and we do not believe it should be pursuant to Regulation S-X.\u201d).\n1730 See supra note 1720 and accompanying text.\n406\n\nAssumptions in the final rules, including by narrowing several aspects of the final rules as\ncompared to the proposal. Declining to adopt the Financial Impact Metrics will reduce costs and\nease many of the burdens that commenters stated would arise as a result of a requirement to\ndisclose financial impacts on a line item basis.1731 As discussed in greater detail below, the final\nrules are focused on requiring the disclosure of capitalized costs, expenditures expensed,\ncharges, and losses1732 incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions,\nand capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, and losses related to carbon offsets and RECs,\nsubject to disclosure thresholds.1733 These capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and\nlosses represent quantitative information that is derived from transactions and amounts recorded\nin a registrant\u2019s books and records underlying the financial statements. The final rules require\nregistrants to disclose where on the balance sheet and income statement these capitalized costs,\nexpenditures expensed, charges, and losses are presented.1734 However, the balance sheet and\nincome statement line items where these capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and\nlosses are presented will be far fewer in number as compared to the number of line items that\nwould have been impacted by the proposed Financial Impact Metrics, which, for example, would\nhave required registrants to disclose changes in revenues due to disruptions of business\n1731 See supra note 1730 and accompanying text.\n1732 While the final rules use the terms \u201ccharges\u201d and \u201closses\u201d in the disclosure requirements related to\nexpenditures, these terms represent impacts that would have been disclosed under the proposed Financial\nImpact Metrics and, accordingly, we do not consider these to be an expansion of the proposed disclosure\nrequirements. See infra note 1735 for an explanation of the overlap between the proposed Financial Impact\nMetrics and the proposed Expenditure Metrics.\n1733 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(c), (d), and (e).\n1734 See id. See infra section K.3.c.i for further discussion of the requirement to disclose where on the balance\nsheet and income statement the required capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses are\npresented.\n407\n\noperations.1735 To narrow the scope further, the final rules do not require the disclosure of any\nimpacts on the statement of cash flows, as would have been required under the proposed\nrules.1736\nIn addition, although we are retaining a one percent disclosure threshold in the final rules,\nregistrants will not be required to apply it on a line item basis to determine whether disclosure is\nrequired since we are not adopting the proposed Financial Impact Metrics. Instead, as discussed\nin greater detail below, the final rules require the application of the one percent disclosure\nthreshold to only two categories of aggregate amounts: (1) expenditures expensed as incurred\nand losses; and (2) capitalized costs and charges, in both cases incurred as a result of severe\nweather events and other natural conditions. The final rules use different denominators for the\ndisclosure thresholds as compared to the proposal and include de minimis thresholds to help\nrespond to commenters\u2019 concerns about burdens.1737 The requirement to disclose capitalized\ncosts, expenditures expensed, and losses related to carbon offsets and RECs is not subject to a\none percent disclosure threshold. Rather, disclosure is only required if carbon offsets and RECs\nhave been used as material component of a registrant\u2019s plans to achieve its disclosed climate-\nrelated targets or goals.1738 As discussed in greater detail above, instead of requiring the\n1735 See Proposing Release, section II.F.2. In response to a request for comment included in the Proposing\nRelease, commenters stated that the Financial Impact Metrics and Expenditure Metrics, as proposed,\npotentially would result in some overlapping disclosures with respect to costs and expenditures (i.e., certain\ncosts included in the aggregate disclosures required by the proposed Expenditure Metrics would also have\nbeen captured by the proposed Financial Impact Metrics line item disclosures).\n1736 See Proposing Release, section II.F.2 (\u201cA registrant would be required to determine the impacts of severe\nweather events, other natural conditions, transition activities, and identified climate-related risks described\nabove on each consolidated financial statement line item.\u201d).\n1737 See infra section II.K.3.c.ii for further discussion of the disclosure threshold requirement. In addition, in\nresponse to commenters\u2019 concerns, we are adopting a principle for attributing an expenditure to a severe\nweather event or other natural condition and for determining the amount to be disclosed. See infra section\nII.K.3.c.iii.\n1738 See infra section II.K.3.c.vi for further discussion of this requirement.\n408\n\ndisclosure of expenditures related to transition activities in the financial statements as proposed,\nthe final rules will require registrants to disclose material expenditures related to (1) activities to\nmitigate or adapt to climate-related risk (in management\u2019s assessment), (2) disclosed transition\nplans, and (3) disclosed targets and goals, outside of the financial statements as part of the\namendments to Regulation S-K.1739 The final rules we are adopting seek to realize many of the\nbenefits of the proposed rules in terms of enhanced financial statement disclosure while\nminimizing the likelihood that issuers will need to undertake costly updates to their internal\nsystems and processes. Physical risks, such as severe weather events and other natural\nconditions, can significantly affect public companies\u2019 financial performance or position.1740\nInvestors need disaggregated disclosure of capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and\nlosses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions to better\nunderstand the effect such events have on the financial statements.1741 By expanding on the\n1739 See supra sections II.D.1.c, II.D.2.c, and II.G.3.a.\n1740 See, e.g., Richard Vanderford, A Punishing Year of Thunderstorms has Led to Record-Breaking Losses,\nThe Wall Street Journal (Nov. 24, 2023) (stating that thunderstorms (formally known as severe convective\nstorms) \u201chave so far led to at least $55.67 billion in insured damages in the U.S. this year through Nov.\n13. . . Insured damages from the storms had never before topped $50 billion.\u201d). See also NOAA National\nCenters for Environmental Information, U.S. Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters (2024),\navailable at https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/ (stating that, in 2023, 28 confirmed weather/climate\ndisaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion each affected the United States, including 1 drought event,\n4 flooding events, 19 severe storm events, 2 tropical cyclone events, 1 wildfire event, and 1 winter storm\nevent, with damages totaling at least $92.9 billion); Form Letter F (stating that increasingly severe weather\nevents \u201caffect numerous corporate assets and operations, putting pressure on essential supply chains, posing\nharm to facilities, and undermining the ability of businesses to meet targets\u201d and therefore investors need to\nbe aware of how companies are impacted by these financial risks).\n1741 See, e.g., letters from As You Sow (stating its support for requiring the disclosure of \u201ccosts of physical\nrisks,\u201d among other things, in the financial statements); Boston Trust (supporting the disclosure of\nexpenditures related to severe weather events); CalPERS (stating that it is important to require the\ndisclosure of the impact of \u201cextreme temperatures, flooding, drought, [and] wildfires\u201d in the financial\nstatements); ICGN (supporting the disclosure of how physical impacts are accounted for in the financial\nstatements); Maple Brown (stating that requiring disclosures in the financial statements would make it\n\u201cbetter equipped to price in potential risks\u201d such as \u201cthe physical risks associated with more frequent and\nextreme weather events\u201d); MNSBI (stating a need for disaggregated physical and transition risk-related\nimpacts on the financial statements); and UCS (\u201cRequiring issuers to disclose disaggregated financial\nmetrics that will be subject to audit must remain in the rule.\u201d).\n409\n\ninformation provided in the financial statements, the final rules will help investors \u201cassess a\nregistrant\u2019s exposure to physical risks,\u201d1742 and \u201cbetter understand the overall vulnerability of\nassets . . . [and] loss experience.\u201d1743 In addition, the requirement to provide disaggregated\ndisclosure of capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, and losses incurred in connection with the\npurchase and use of carbon offsets and RECs will provide investors with needed transparency\nabout the financial statement effects of a registrant\u2019s purchase and use of carbon offsets and\nRECs as part of its climate-related business strategy. As such, the disclosure required by the\nfinal rules will help investors make better informed investment or voting decisions by eliciting\nmore complete disclosure of financial statement effects and improving the consistency,\ncomparability, and reliability of such disclosures. In this way, the final rules appropriately\nbalance the need for enhanced financial statement disclosures with the potential costs entailed to\nproduce such disclosures given the current state of financial reporting practices.\nConsistent with the proposed rules, the final rules require a registrant to include the\nfinancial statement disclosures in any filing that is required to include disclosure pursuant to\nsubpart 1500 and that also requires the registrant to include its audited financial statements.1744\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this means that a registrant is required to comply with the\nrequirements in Article 14 even if it does not have information to disclose pursuant to subpart\n1500, as long as the applicable Commission filing requires the registrant to comply with subpart\n1500. Including disclosure of the financial statement effects in a note to the financial statements,\n1742 See letter from Boston Trust.\n1743 See letter from IAA.\n1744 See 17 CFR 210.14-01(a). For example, the note to the financial statements will not be required in a Form\n10-Q filing. Similarly, the note to the financial statements will not be required for unaudited interim\nfinancial statements included in a registration statement. See, e.g., 17 CFR 210.3-01, 3-02, 8-03, 10-01.\nSee also infra note 2380 and section II.L.3, which discuss the applicability of the rules to foreign private\nissuers.\n410\n\nas proposed, as opposed to including them outside of the financial statements, such as\nexclusively in the MD&A section of registrants\u2019 filings as recommended by some\ncommenters,1745 will subject these disclosures to the same financial statement audit and ICFR as\nsimilar financial disclosures, which will improve their consistency, quality, and reliability and\nthereby provide an important benefit to investors.\nIn addition, the disclosure requirements we are adopting will apply to public companies\ngenerally as opposed to only requiring companies in certain industries or sectors to comply with\nthe final rules. The final rules are focused on requiring the disclosure of capitalized costs,\nexpenditures expensed, charges, and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and\nother natural conditions, which are occurrences that can happen to public companies in any\nsector or industry, and therefore it would not be appropriate to only require public companies in\ncertain sectors or industries to comply with the rules. The decision not to limit the scope of\nArticle 14 to only public companies in certain sectors or industries is consistent with the\napproach we are taking with respect to the amendments to Regulation S-K, which similarly are\nnot limited to public companies in certain sectors or industries.\nFurthermore, the financial statement disclosure requirements included in the final rules\nwill apply to SRCs and EGCs. A few commenters raised concerns about the application of the\nproposed financial statement disclosure requirements to smaller companies, including SRCs.1746\nWe considered whether it would be appropriate to exempt SRCs and EGCs from the financial\nstatement disclosure requirements. We recognize that SRCs generally may avail themselves of\n1745 See supra note 1724 and accompanying text. Registrants are reminded that they may nonetheless have an\nobligation to discuss climate-related information in MD&A if the information meets the requirements for\ndisclosure under Item 303 of Regulation S-K. See 17 CFR 229.303; 2010 Guidance.\n1746 See, e.g., letters from Abrasca; Cohn Rez.; Henry H. Huang (Apr. 16, 2022) (\u201cH. Huang\u201d); NAM; US\nSBA; and Volta.\n411\n\nthe scaled disclosure requirements in Article 8 of Regulation S-X. However, as the Commission\nexpressed in the Proposing Release, we determined that it is appropriate to apply the financial\nstatement disclosure requirements to SRCs and EGCs because severe weather events and other\nnatural conditions can pose significant risks to the operations and financial conditions of all\nregistrants. We expect that the narrower scope of the final rules we are adopting will\nsignificantly mitigate the costs and burdens for registrants of all sizes as compared to the\nproposed rules, including certain aspects of the final rules that may particularly benefit SRCs and\nEGCs, such as a de minimis disclosure threshold, which is discussed in further detail below. The\nfinal rules also provide SRCs and EGCs with a longer phased in compliance period than other\nregistrants, which will give them more time to prepare to comply with the final rules.1747 In\naddition, as explained in greater detail below in section II.L.3, the final rules, including the\namendments to Regulation S-X, will not apply to a private company that is a party to a business\ncombination transaction, as defined by Securities Act Rule 165(f), involving a securities offering\nregistered on Form S-4 or F-4.\nWe do not agree with those commenters who stated that the Commission should not\nadopt the amendments and instead refer the matter to the FASB.1748 Although the Commission\nhas recognized the FASB\u2019s financial accounting and reporting standards as \u201cgenerally accepted\u201d\nfor purposes of the Federal securities laws, as explained above in section II.B, the Securities Act\nand the Exchange Act (as confirmed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002) make it clear that the\nCommission has the ultimate responsibility and broad authority to set accounting standards,\n1747 See infra section II.O.3 for a discussion of the compliance dates for the final rules.\n1748 See supra note 1726 and accompanying text. Some commenters, however, stated that the Commission\nshould not defer to the FASB. See, e.g., letters from Ceres; and CFA Institute.\n412\n\nprinciples, and financial statement disclosure requirements for registrants.1749 The Commission\nis exercising its authority to prescribe the financial statement disclosure requirements included in\nthe final rules in response to the need expressed by investors for information related to the\nfinancial statement impacts of severe weather events as discussed elsewhere in this release.1750\nSignificantly, the rules we are adopting amend both Regulation S-K, which prescribes the\nnarrative disclosure requirements for registrants\u2019 periodic filings with the Commission, and\nRegulation S-X, which prescribes the requirements for the financial statements included in those\nfilings. Therefore, adopting financial statement requirements as part of this rulemaking will\nprovide for consistent disclosure of information across registrants\u2019 public filings and avoid\npotential inconsistencies that could arise through an approach that requires both Commission and\nindependent FASB action.1751 In addition, the final rules will apply regardless of whether the\n1749 See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. 77s(a) (Among other things, the Commission shall have authority, for the purposes of\nthis subchapter, to prescribe the form or forms in which required information shall be set forth, the items or\ndetails to be shown in the balance sheet and earning statement, and the methods to be followed in the\npreparation of accounts, in the appraisal or valuation of assets and liabilities, in the determination of\ndepreciation and depletion, in the differentiation of recurring and nonrecurring income, in the\ndifferentiation of investment and operating income, and in the preparation, where the Commission deems it\nnecessary or desirable, of consolidated balance sheets or income accounts of any person directly or\nindirectly controlling or controlled by the issuer, or any person under direct or indirect common control\nwith the issuer. The rules and regulations of the Commission shall be effective upon publication in the\nmanner which the Commission shall prescribe); 15 U.S.C. 7218(c) (Nothing in this Act, including this\nsection and the amendment made by this section, shall be construed to impair or limit the authority of\nthe Commission to establish accounting principles or standards for purposes of enforcement of\nthe securities laws.); and Policy Statement: Reaffirming the Status of the FASB as a Designated Private-\nSector Standard Setter, Release No. 33-8221 (Apr. 25, 2003) [68 FR 23333, 23334 (May 1, 2003)] (While\nthe Commission consistently has looked to the private sector in the past to set accounting standards, the\nsecurities laws, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, clearly provide the Commission with authority to set\naccounting standards for public companies and other entities that file financial statements with the\nCommission.).

As discussed in greater detail above in section II.B, the Commission has\npreviously adopted presentation and disclosure requirements regarding the form and content of the financial\n413\n\nregistrant applies U.S. GAAP, IFRS, or local GAAP, and therefore rulemaking by the\nCommission ensures that registrants are subject to the same requirements since the adoption of\nstandards by the FASB would be limited to registrants that apply U.S. GAAP to their financial\nstatements. Under each of these circumstances, it is appropriate for the Commission to adopt\nrules to ensure that investors are receiving the consistent, comparable, and reliable information\nthey need to make timely investing and voting decisions.1752\n2. Financial Impact Metrics\na. Proposed Rules\nThe Commission proposed to amend Regulation S-X to require a registrant to disclose\nFinancial Impact Metrics. More specifically, the Financial Impact Metrics would have required\na registrant to disclose the financial impacts from severe weather events and other natural\nconditions and transition activities on any relevant line item in the registrant\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial statements during the fiscal years presented.1753 The Commission explained in the\nProposing Release that this proposed requirement was intended to complement the proposed\nrequirement in Item 1502(d) of Regulation S-K that called for a registrant to provide a narrative\ndiscussion of whether and how any of its identified climate-related risks have affected or are\nreasonably likely to affect the registrant\u2019s consolidated financial statements.1754 The\nstatements. For example, Rule 5-02 of Regulation S-X prescribes the various line items and certain\nadditional disclosures that should appear on the face of the balance sheet or related notes. See 17 CFR\n210.5-02.\n1752 See General Revision of Regulation S-X, Release No. 6233 (Sept. 25, 1980) [45 FR 63660, 63661 (Sept. 25,\n1980)] (explaining, in connection with amendments to Regulation S-X, that the Commission does not\nbelieve \u201cany decision to require particular disclosures . . . through rulemaking in [Regulation] S-X,\nconflicts with the basic policy of relying on the FASB for leadership in establishing financial accounting\nand reporting standards\u201d).\n1753 See Proposing Release, section II.F.2.\n1754 See id.\n414\n\nCommission also explained in the Proposing Release that requiring disclosure of the impacts\nfrom severe weather events and other natural conditions and transition activities would capture a\nbroad spectrum of physical and transition risks.1755 To aid in the comparability of disclosures\nand to assist issuers, the proposed rules identified flooding, drought, wildfires, extreme\ntemperatures, and sea level rise as non-exclusive examples of severe weather events and other\nnatural conditions that may require disclosure.1756 The Commission further noted that there has\nbeen an increased recognition of the current and potential effects, both positive and negative, of\nthese events and associated physical risks on a registrant\u2019s business as well as its financial\nperformance and position.1757 With respect to transition risks, the Commission proposed to\nrequire a registrant to disclose the financial impact of any identified transition risks and any\nefforts to reduce GHG emissions or otherwise mitigate exposure to transition risks (collectively,\n\u201ctransition activities\u201d) on any relevant line items in the registrant\u2019s consolidated financial\nstatements during the fiscal years presented.1758\nThe proposed rules prescribed a specific quantitative disclosure threshold for the\nFinancial Impact Metrics. Specifically, a registrant would have been required to disclose the\nimpacts of severe weather events, other natural conditions, and transition activities on the\nconsolidated financial statements included in the relevant filing unless the aggregated impact of\nthe severe weather events, other natural conditions, and transition activities was less than one\n1755 See id.\n1756 See id. With the exception of wildfires, all of these examples were identified by the Commission more than\na decade ago in its 2010 Guidance as events that could potentially affect a registrant\u2019s operations and\nresults.\n1757 See id. (citing, among other sources, the FSOC\u2019s Report on Climate Related Financial Risk 2021, which\ndiscussed significant costs from the types of events identified in the proposed rule).\n1758 See id.\n415\n\npercent of the total line item for the relevant fiscal year.1759 The Commission stated that this\nquantitative threshold would provide a bright-line standard for registrants and should reduce the\nrisk of underreporting such information.1760 The Commission further stated that the proposed\nquantitative threshold could promote comparability and consistency among a registrant\u2019s filings\nover time and among different registrants compared to a more principles-based approach.1761\nThe Commission also pointed out that it has used similar one-percent thresholds in other contexts\n(within the financial statements and without),1762 and that, more generally, other rules such as 17\nCFR 229.103 and 17 CFR 229.404 use quantitative disclosure thresholds to facilitate\ncomparability, consistency, and clarity in determining when information must be disclosed.1763\nUnder the proposed rules, impacts would have, at a minimum, been required to be\ndisclosed on an aggregated, line-by-line basis for all negative impacts and, separately, on an\naggregated, line-by-line basis for all positive impacts.1764 For purposes of determining whether\n1759 See id.\n1760 See id.\n1761 See id.\n1762 See, e.g., 17 CFR 210.5-03.1(a) (stating that if the total of sales and revenues reported under this caption\nincludes excise taxes in an amount equal to 1% or more of such total, the amount of such excise taxes shall\nbe shown on the face of the statement parenthetically or otherwise) and 17 CFR 210.12-13 (requiring\ndisclosure of open option contracts by management investment companies using a 1% of net asset value\nthreshold, based on the notional amounts of the contracts).\n1763 See Proposing Release, section II.F.2 (citing 17 CFR 229.103(b)(2) (requiring disclosure of a legal\nproceeding primarily involving a claim for damages if the amount involved, exclusive of interest and costs,\nexceeds 10 percent of the current assets of the registrant and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis),\n(c)(3)(iii) (requiring disclosure of a judicial proceeding that has been enacted or adopted regulating the\ndischarge of materials into the environment or primarily for the purpose of protecting the environment, if a\ngovernmental authority is a party to such proceeding and such proceeding involves potential monetary\nsanctions, unless the registrant reasonably believes that such proceeding will result in no monetary\nsanctions or monetary sanctions, exclusive of interest and costs, of less than $300,000) and 17 CFR\n229.404(a) (requiring disclosure of any transaction, since the beginning of the registrant\u2019s last fiscal year,\nor any currently proposed transaction, in which the registrant was or is to be a participant and the amount\ninvolved exceeds $120,000, and in which any related person had or will have a direct or indirect material\ninterest).\n1764 See id.\n416\n\nthe disclosure threshold has been met, a registrant would be required to aggregate the absolute\nvalue of the positive and negative impacts on a line-by-line basis, which the Commission\nexplained would better reflect the significance of the impact of severe weather events, other\nnatural conditions, and transition activities on a registrant\u2019s financial performance and\nposition.1765\nTo provide additional clarity, the proposed rules included the following examples of\ndisclosures that may be required to reflect the impact of the severe weather events and other\nnatural conditions on each line item of the registrant\u2019s consolidated financial statements (e.g.,\nline items of the consolidated income statement, balance sheet, or cash flow statement):\n\u2022 Changes to revenues or costs from disruptions to business operations or supply\nchains;\n\u2022 Impairment charges and changes to the carrying amount of assets (such as\ninventory, intangibles, and property, plant, and equipment) due to the assets being\nexposed to severe weather, flooding, drought, wildfires, extreme temperatures,\nand sea level rise;\n\u2022 Changes to loss contingencies or reserves (such as environmental reserves or loan\nloss allowances) due to impact from severe weather events; and\n\u2022 Changes to total expected insured losses due to flooding or wildfire patterns.1766\nWith respect to the financial impacts of transition activities, the proposed rules included\nthe following examples of potential impacts:\n1765 See id.\n1766 See id.\n417\n\n\u2022 Changes to revenue or cost due to new emissions pricing or regulations resulting\nin the loss of a sales contract;\n\u2022 Changes to operating, investing, or financing cash flow from changes in upstream\ncosts, such as transportation of raw materials;\n\u2022 Changes to the carrying amount of assets (such as intangibles and property, plant,\nand equipment), for example, due to a reduction of the asset\u2019s useful life or a\nchange in the asset\u2019s salvage value by being exposed to transition activities; and\n\u2022 Changes to interest expense driven by financial instruments such as climate-\nlinked bonds issued where the interest rate increases if certain climate-related\ntargets are not met.1767\nThe Commission noted in the Proposing Release that an analogous approach to\ndisaggregated, or separately stated, disclosure has been taken in other contexts within the\nfinancial statements and elsewhere, including in segment reporting,1768 and that the importance\nof disaggregated disclosure in a registrant\u2019s financial statements is also supported by concepts set\nforth in FASB ASC Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 15 Revenue\n1767 See id.\n1768 For example, in segment reporting, a registrant must present within its consolidated financial statements a\nseparate presentation of certain financial statement line items for each segment. See FASB ASC Topic 280\nSegment Reporting and IFRS 8 Operating Segments (requiring segment reporting disclosures to be included\nin the audited financial statements). The Commission has noted the importance of disaggregated disclosure\nin the segment reporting context, stating that it \u201chas long been aware of the importance of meaningful\nsegment information to reasoned investment decision-making.\u201d See Industry and Homogenous Geographic\nSegment Reporting, Release No. 33-6514 (Feb. 15, 1984) [49 FR 6737, 6738 (Feb. 23, 1984)]. For\nsimplicity, we do not refer to the corresponding IFRS in each instance where we reference the FASB ASC.\nAccordingly, references in this release to the FASB ASC should be read to refer also to the corresponding\nIFRS for foreign private issuers applying those standards.\n418\n\nfrom Contracts with Customers.1769 The Commission further noted that disaggregation of certain\nfinancial statement line items is also required by Article 5 of Regulation S-X, which calls for\nseparate disclosure of specific balance sheet and income statement line items when practicable or\nwhen certain percentage thresholds are met, depending on the nature of the information.1770\nFinally, the Commission proposed to require registrants to disclose the impacts of any\nclimate-related risks identified pursuant to proposed Item 1502(a) of Regulation S-K\u2014both\nphysical risks and transition risks\u2014on any of the financial statement metrics.1771\nb. Comments\ni. General Comments\nSome commenters supported the proposal to require disclosure of Financial Impact\nMetrics.1772 These commenters generally indicated that the proposed disclosures would be used\n1769 See Proposing Release, section II.F.2. FASB ASC Topic 606 and IFRS 15 require, among other things,\ndisclosure of disaggregated revenue recognized from contracts with customers into categories that depict\nhow the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic\nfactors.\n1770 See Proposing Release, section II.F.2. The analogies presented in this paragraph are not intended to imply\nthat FASB ASC Topic 280, IFRS 8 or other concepts would have to be applied when accounting for and\ndisclosing the financial statement effects required by the final rules.

A few commenters stated that, to the extent the Commission does not\nadopt a principles-based approach, the Commission should consider adopting a combination of a\nhigher percentage threshold along with a dollar threshold.1844 Another commenter stated that if\nthe Commission incorporates a dollar amount into the threshold it should be significantly higher\nthan $1 million.1845 One commenter suggested a materiality standard combined with a dollar-\nbased disclosure threshold.1846 A couple of commenters stated that they did not support applying\na dollar threshold.1847\nOne commenter stated that the Commission should not apply a disclosure threshold and\ninstead should require disclosure of any impacts.1848 A couple of commenters asserted that the\nCommission should also require registrants to determine whether an impact that falls below the\nprescribed one percent threshold would nevertheless be material given its nature and, if so, to\nrequire disclosure of that impact.1849 One commenter suggested setting a basic principle based\n1842 See, e.g., letters from AFPA; and Chamber.\n1843 See letter from Morningstar.\n1844 See, e.g., letters from B.

A number of commenters disagreed\nwith the proposal to aggregate the absolute value of impacts.1852 Some of these commenters\nstated that it would be a significant departure from typical accounting practices,1853 and others\nasserted it would be unworkable and would result in the disclosure of individually immaterial\ninformation.1854 One commenter suggested that any aggregation requirements should allow a\nregistrant to set a minimum materiality threshold for individual items.1855 On the other hand,\nsome commenters supported aggregating the absolute value of impacts, with one commenter\nof 1% of the total line item (including for expenditure items), additional disclosure would be appropriate\nwhere the aggregate impact is less than this, but investors have expressed a clear interest in understanding\nthis impact (thus making it material).\u201d).\n1850 See letter from Beller, et al.\n1851 See letter from ClientEarth.\n1852 See, e.g., letters from AAR; ABA; AFPA; Alliance Resource; API; CCR; CEMEX; Chamber; Cleco;\nCleveland Cliffs; Dell; D.

Terminology and Attribution\nA number of commenters pointed out that \u201csevere weather events and other natural\nconditions\u201d is not defined in the proposal and they asserted that additional clarification or\nguidance is needed.1865 Some commenters stated that the proposed amendments to Regulation S-\nX refer to \u201csevere weather events,\u201d while the proposed amendments to Regulation S-K refer to\n\u201cextreme weather events,\u201d and that the amendments provided overlapping, but different,\nexamples.1866 A few commenters suggested that the Commission should limit any required\ndisclosures to a specified list of severe weather events and other natural conditions.1867 For\nexample, one commenter suggested that the Commission could establish a list of weather events\nand update it on a monthly or quarterly basis,1868 but another commenter stated that maintaining\na list of events would be impractical.1869 A few commenters suggested that the Commission\ncould borrow or refer to a list of severe weather events and other natural conditions prepared by\n1863 See, e.g., letters from ClientEarth; and Third Coast.\n1864 See, e.g., letter from MN SBI.\n1865 See, e.g., letters from Abrasca; AEPC; Alliance Resource; Amazon; Anthesis; APCIA; BDO USA LLP;\nBHP; BPI; Ceres, et al.; Chamber; Cleary Gottlieb; Corteva; Davis Polk; Deutsche Bank; EEI & AGA;\nEMC; Eni SpA; EPSA; FedEx; GPA Midstream; IADC; IIF; INGAA; Marathon; Morningstar; Mtg.\nBankers; Nareit; NRA/RLC; NRP; Occidental Petroleum; PwC; RSM US LLP; Shearman Sterling; Shell;\nSoc.

A few commenters stated that registrants should be permitted to make a\nreasonable estimate and disclose the assumptions that resulted in the estimate.1913 Commenters\nsuggested that disclosing the relevant assumptions would help investors interpret any estimations\nthat may be required.1914 One commenter recommended that any final rules should allow\nregistrants to disclose either a single amount or a range, along with appropriate contextual\ninformation. This commenter noted that if the Commission proceeds with a single amount,\nregistrants would require guidance on how the amount should be determined.1915 Another\ncommenter suggested that a registrant should be allowed to explain that it was unable to disclose\nthe required information on a disaggregated basis due to impacts that were caused by a mixture\nof factors.1916 Other commenters suggested that when disaggregation is not possible due to\n1909 See, e.g., letters from BHP; Chamber; GPA Midstream; Grant Thornton; Nareit; PGIM; United Air; Volta;\nWestern Midstream; and Williams Cos.\n1910 See, e.g., letters from AEPC; Barrick Gold; G.

Alternatives\nCommenters suggested a number of potential alternatives to the proposed financial\nstatement metrics.1922 Several commenters recommended that the Commission limit any\nrequirement to disclose climate-related impacts to \u201cfirst order effects\u201d or direct impacts only.1923\nSpecifically with respect to severe weather events, some commenters stated that it would be\noperationally possible to track specific, direct costs incurred due to severe weather events and\nnatural conditions.1924 For example, one commenter noted that certain property damage and\nrelated repair costs sustained as a result of severe weather could \u201ceasily be segregated, analyzed,\nand quantified within our current processes.\u201d1925 Another commenter stated that calculating\ndirect costs incurred due to severe weather events might be straightforward because the costs are\nrecorded in the registrant\u2019s financial records.1926 One commenter recommended that the\n\u201cCommission consider limiting Article 14 of Regulation S-X requirements to physical impacts\n1922 In many cases, the commenters discussed in this section expressed a stronger preference for other\napproaches discussed above, such as not adopting or reducing the proposed disclosure requirements but\noffered these alternatives to the proposed rules as well.\n1923 See, e.g., letters from BOA; C2ES; Citigroup; and SIA.\n1924 See, e.g., letters from Autodesk (noting that if a fire or storm destroys a registrant\u2019s facilities, the associated\ncosts, impairments, and contingencies would be accounted for and, if material, disclosed under U.S.\nGAAP); Crowe; Dow; and Nutrien (noting that it would be operationally possible to track specific costs\nincurred to mitigate transition risks or costs incurred due to severe weather events and natural conditions).\n1925 See letter from Dow (explaining, however, that \u201c[q]uantifying the indirect impact of [severe weather\nevents] on sales and cost of sales would be exceedingly difficult and require significant judgment, estimates\nand assumptions, thereby limiting the comparability of such information with other registrants and the\nusefulness of such information to investors\u201d).\n1926 See letter from Crowe. See also letter from PwC (stating that the financial impact of some climate-related\nrisks \u2013 for example, losses arising from asset impairments or operations and maintenance expenses\nassociated with site restoration \u2013 may already be disclosed under existing GAAP, although the disclosures\nmay not clearly link to the impact of climate).\n443\n\nand related expenditures only.\u201d1927 More generally, another commenter recommended\nstreamlining the proposed rules to focus on \u201cwhat issuers can easily produce.\u201d1928\nA few commenters recommended alternative approaches that focused on requiring the\ndisclosure of discrete expenditures. For example, one commenter recommended that the\nCommission require a table in a note to the financial statements that presents discrete and\nseparable expenditures, both expensed and capitalized, in three distinct categories: (i) climate-\nrelated events, (ii) transition activities for publicly-disclosed climate-related targets and goals,\nand (iii) all other transition activities.1929 Similarly, another commenter recommended that the\nCommission should require disclosure of \u201cidentifiable direct costs and capital expenditures\nincurred for the express purpose of addressing climate events and transition issues,\u201d which\n\u201ccould be produced and audited with a level of certainty and comparability that is consistent with\nGAAP financial statements.\u201d1930\nOther commenters recommended taking a more aggregated approach to disclosure. For\nexample, one commenter suggested aggregating costs and benefits relating to climate-related\nevents into categories (revenues, expenditures, and profits), and aggregating impacts on the\nbalance sheet into the categories (assets, liabilities, and equity), which the commenter stated\nwould ensure investors are able to identify the magnitude of the impacts affecting the company\n1927 See letter from Dell.\n1928 See letter from MFA.

See also letter from C2ES (Feb. 13, 2023) (describing the expenditure table\nincluded in Amazon\u2019s comment letter as a more workable alternative but reiterating concerns with other\naspects of the proposed rules, such as the disclosure threshold).\n1930 See letter from ABA. See also letter from Ceres (recommending disclosure of current period and planned\ncapital expenditures to show the portion of investments attributable to addressing transition risks and\nopportunities and the adaptation to or mitigation of physical risks associated with climate change).\n444\n\nwithout unnecessary complication and cost for registrants.1931 Another commenter\nrecommended requiring disclosure at the event or activity level rather than disclosing impacts on\nfinancial statement line items, and focusing on discrete, material climate-related events and\ntransition activities.1932 Similarly, another commenter recommended analyzing potential impacts\nby broad accounting topics, such as impairments or useful life of assets, which would\nsimultaneously cover several lines of the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow\nstatement.1933 One commenter suggested that the Commission could enhance comparability by\nidentifying a minimum set of line items for which disclosure is required while permitting\nregistrants to present disclosure on additional line items in order to better reflect their business\nmodel and industry.1934 On the other hand, one commenter recommended a more disaggregated\napproach to disclosure.1935\nAdditionally, one commenter recommended that the Commission adopt a \u201ctop down\napproach\u201d by linking disclosure of short-term risks identified under the proposed amendments to\nRegulation S-K to financial statement impacts that would be required to be disclosed at a\nspecified threshold, and supplemented by the disclosure of other material impacts.1936 Another\ncommenter suggested requiring the disclosure of climate-related cash-flow metrics, focused on\nproviding gross cash flows of climate-related expenditures, with an indication of which cash\n1931 See letter from PIMCO.\n1932 See letter from Alphabet et al.\n1933 See letter from TotalEnergies.

Final Rules\nAfter consideration of the comments, including those expressing significant concerns\nabout the burdens associated with this aspect of the proposal, we are not adopting the proposed\nFinancial Impact Metrics.1939 While the proposed Financial Impact Metrics would have\nprovided additional transparency for investors, we were persuaded by those commenters that\nstated the proposed Financial Impact Metrics would be burdensome and costly for registrants\nbecause of the updates that would be necessary to internal systems and processes. 1940\nTherefore, at this time, we have chosen not to adopt these disclosures. These concerns led us to\nadopt a significantly narrower set of requirements that are focused on requiring the disclosure of\na discrete set of actual expenses that registrants incur and can attribute to severe weather events\nand other natural conditions. In line with the views of certain commenters,1941 we expect these\n1937 See letter from CFA Institute.\n1938 See letter from Ceres (recommending that the Commission also consider also expanding its industry guides\nfor mining, bank holding companies, real estate limited partnerships, and property-casualty insurance\nunderwriters). The industry guides for oil and gas, mining, and bank and savings and loan companies have\nbeen codified by the Commission. See 17 CFR 229.1201 through 1208 (oil and gas); 17 CFR 229.1300\nthrough 1305 (mining); and 17 CFR 229.1401 through 1406 (bank and savings and loan).\n1939 As discussed in greater detail below, since we are not adopting the proposed Financial Impact Metrics, a\nregistrant will not have the option to disclose the impact of any climate-related opportunities on the\nFinancial Impact Metrics. See infra section II.K.5.c. For the same reason, we are not adopting the\nrequirement set forth in proposed Rule 14-02(i) requiring a registrant to include the impacts of any climate-\nrelated risks identified pursuant to proposed Item 1502(a) on the Financial Impact Metrics.\n1940 See supra note 1791 and accompanying text.\n1941 See supra notes 1924 and 1926 and accompanying text.\n446\n\nrequirements to be more feasible for registrants to disclose under current financial reporting\nprocesses. Moreover, given the overlapping nature of some of the disclosures that would have\nbeen required by the proposed Financial Impact Metrics and the capitalized costs, expenditures\nexpensed, charges, and losses that are required to be disclosed under the final rules,1942 the\nrequirements we are adopting will provide many of the same benefits of transparency and\ninsights that the proposed Financial Impact Metrics would have provided, albeit without as much\ndetail, which should reduce the burden on registrants.\nIn addition, as discussed in greater detail below in section II.K.3.c.ii, we emphasize that\nregistrants currently have an obligation under GAAP to consider material impacts on the\nfinancial statements, and the fact that the impact may be driven by climate-related matters does\nnot alter registrants\u2019 financial reporting obligations.1943 Therefore, a registrant should consider\nwhether it currently has an obligation to disclose information that would have been covered by\nthe proposed Financial Impact Metrics. Our decision not to adopt the proposed Financial Impact\nMetrics does not affect registrants\u2019 ongoing responsibility to consider material impacts, including\nthose that may be climate-related, when preparing their financial statements and related\ndisclosures.\nAlthough we are not adopting the proposed Financial Impact Metrics at this time, certain\naspects of the proposed rules discussed at length above also applied to, or were substantially\nsimilar to, the proposed Expenditure Metrics. For example, the proposed one percent disclosure\nthreshold and terminology such as \u201csevere weather events and other natural conditions\u201d were\n1942 See supra notes 1732 and 1735.\n1943 See infra notes 2068 and 2069 and accompanying text.\n447\n\nincluded in the proposals for both proposed metrics.1944 A number of commenters provided\nfeedback on these issues generally, without indicating that their comments were limited to only\nthe proposed Financial Impact Metrics or to only the proposed Expenditure Metrics.1945 In\naddition, some of the alternatives discussed above are relevant to the proposed Expenditure\nMetrics.1946 As such, we also considered these comments with respect to the proposed\nExpenditure Metrics. Below, our discussion focuses on additional issues that commenters raised\nwith respect to the proposed Expenditure Metrics. As a result, our rationale for the final rules\ntakes into consideration all of the commenter feedback we received on the proposed rules.\n3. Expenditure Effects\na. Proposed Rules\nThe Commission proposed to amend Regulation S-X to require a registrant to disclose\nExpenditure Metrics. As proposed, the Expenditure Metrics referred to the positive and negative\nimpacts associated with the same severe weather events, other natural conditions, transition\nactivities, and identified climate-related risks as the proposed Financial Impact Metrics.1947\nRegistrants would have been required to separately aggregate the amounts of (i) expenditures\nexpensed and (ii) capitalized costs incurred during the fiscal years presented.1948 For each of\n1944 See Proposing Release, sections II.F.2 and 3.\n1945 See, e.g., letters from B. Herron (opposing the 1% disclosure threshold generally without distinguishing\nbetween the proposed Financial Impact Metrics and the proposed Expenditure Metrics); Moody\u2019s (\u201c[W]e\ntherefore suggest the Commission dispense with the one-percent rule in favor of a more principles-based\napproach for reporting any financial statement metrics.\u201d); and Sens. J. Reed et al. (stating its support for the\n1% disclosure threshold without distinguishing between the proposed Financial Impact Metrics and the\nproposed Expenditure Metrics).\n1946 See supra section II.K.2.b.iv.\n1947 See Proposing Release, section II.F.3.\n1948 The Proposing Release explained that these metrics are focused on expenditures (spending) incurred in\neach reported fiscal year(s), and it stated that the number of periods of the expenditure metrics should\ncorrespond to the number of years of income statement or cash flow statement presented in the\nconsolidated financial statements. See id.\n448\n\nthose categories, a registrant would have been required to disclose separately the amount\nincurred during the fiscal years presented (i) toward positive and negative impacts associated\nwith the climate-related events and (ii) toward transition activities.1949 The proposed rules\nprovided that the registrant could also choose to disclose the impact of efforts to pursue climate-\nrelated opportunities.1950 As discussed above, under the proposal, if a registrant elected to\ndisclose the impact of an opportunity, it would have been required to do so consistently and\nwould have been required to follow the same presentation and disclosure threshold requirements\napplicable to the required disclosures of the Expenditure Metrics.1951 The Proposing Release\nexplained that the amount of expenditure disclosed pursuant to the proposed Expenditure Metrics\nwould be a portion, if not all, of the registrant\u2019s total recorded expenditure (expensed or\ncapitalized), as calculated pursuant to the accounting principles applicable to the registrant\u2019s\nfinancial statements.1952\nThe proposed Expenditure Metrics were subject to the same disclosure threshold as the\nFinancial Impact Metrics, which the Commission explained would promote comparability,\nconsistency, and clarity in determining when information must be disclosed.1953 The\nCommission explained in the Proposing Release that for purposes of calculating the disclosure\nthresholds for the Expenditure Metrics, a registrant could separately determine the amount of\nexpenditure expensed and the amount of expenditure capitalized; however, a registrant would\nhave been required to aggregate expenditure related to climate-related events and transition\n1949 See id.\n1950 See id.\n1951 See id.\n1952 See id. (citing 17 CFR 210.4-01(a)(1) and (2)).\n1953 See id.\n449\n\nactivities within the categories of expenditure (i.e., amount capitalized and amount\nexpensed).1954 This approach was designed to better reflect the significance of climate-related\nexpenditure compared to a calculation approach that allowed for a disclosure threshold to be\nmeasured at the individual event or activity level, which may result in more limited disclosures.\nThe Proposing Release provided examples of how a registrant would evaluate and\ndisclose the proposed Expenditure Metrics, including examples of contextual information that\ncould require disclosure, such as information about the specific climate-related events and\ntransition activities that were aggregated for purposes of determining the impacts on the\ncapitalized and expensed amounts.1955 To provide additional clarity, the proposed rules clarified\nthat a registrant may be required to disclose the amount of expenditure expensed or capitalized\ncosts, as applicable, incurred for the climate-related events to increase the resilience of assets or\noperations, retire or shorten the estimated useful lives of impacted assets, relocate assets or\noperations at risk, or otherwise reduce the future impact of severe weather events and other\nnatural conditions on business operations.1956 The proposed rules also clarified that a registrant\nmay be required to disclose the amount of expenditure expensed or capitalized costs, as\napplicable, incurred for climate-related transition activities related to research and development\nof new technologies, purchase of assets, infrastructure, or products that are intended to reduce\nGHG emissions, increase energy efficiency, offset emissions (purchase of energy credits), or\nimprove other resource efficiency.1957\n1954 See id.\n1955 See id.\n1956 See id.\n1957 See id.\n450\n\nThe Commission stated in the Proposing Release that separate disclosure of total expense\nand total capitalized costs incurred toward the climate-related events and transition activities\nshould provide important information to help investors make better informed investment or\nvoting decisions.1958 The Commission pointed out that the financial impacts of expenditure\ntypically appear in different places within the financial statements (e.g., in an asset line item(s)\non the balance sheet or in an expense line item(s) in the income statement), and therefore the\nproposed approach, which would require registrants to first identify the relevant climate-related\nexpenditures and then compile those impacts in one location, was intended to address this\ndispersed presentation.1959\nb. Comments\nAs discussed above, some commenters generally stated that they supported the proposed\namendments to Regulation S-X, including the financial statement disclosures.1960 Other\ncommenters specifically stated that they supported the proposed Expenditure Metrics.1961 As\npreviously noted, some of the commenters who supported the proposed amendments to\n1958 See id.\n1959 See id.\n1960 See, e.g., letters from A.

Many commenters generally stated that they did not support the proposed\namendments to Regulation S-X for the feasibility and other reasons described above.1971 Other\ncommenters specifically stated that they disagreed with the proposed Expenditure Metrics.1972\nFor example, some commenters stated that the proposed Expenditure Metrics would be time\nintensive and costly for companies.1973 One of these commenters stated that registrants \u201cdo not\n1969 See letter from PRI.

Final Rules\ni. Scope (Rules 14-02(c) and (d))\nThe proposed Expenditure Metrics would have required registrants to disclose\nexpenditures expensed and capitalized costs to mitigate the risks of severe weather events and\nother natural conditions and related to transition activities.1993 After consideration of the\ncomments, we are adopting a requirement (Rules 14-02(c) and (d)) to disclose expenditures\nexpensed and capitalized costs with a number of changes from the proposed rules based on\ncommenter feedback.1994 In response to the concerns identified by commenters above, we have\nmodified the proposed requirements and are adopting final rules that require disclosures that\n1989 See id.\n1990 See letter from Can.

McClellan (seeking clarification on expensed or capitalized costs partially incurred\ntowards the climate-related events and transition activities); RSM US LLP; and Salesforce (seeking\nclarification around what constitutes \u201cexpenditures incurred for climate-related transition activities related\nto research and development of new technologies, purchase of assets, infrastructure or products that are\nintended to reduce GHG emissions, increase energy efficiency, offset emissions (purchase of energy\ncredits), or improve other resource efficiency\u201d).\n1993 See Proposing Release, section II.F.3.\n1994 See supra note 1720 and accompanying text.\n456\n\nsignificantly reduce the burdens for registrants while providing investors with decision-useful\ninformation.\nThe final rules focus on requiring the disclosure of capitalized costs, expenditures\nexpensed, charges, and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural\nconditions, which is similar to certain of the alternatives suggested by commenters.1995 Having\nconsidered the various alternatives presented by commenters, we concluded that focusing on the\ndisclosure of discrete expenditures related to severe weather events and other natural conditions\nstrikes an appropriate balance between providing investors with useful information and limiting\nthe burdens on registrants.\nUnder the final rules, a registrant must disclose:\n(1) The aggregate amount of expenditures expensed as incurred and losses, excluding\nrecoveries, incurred during the fiscal year as a result of severe weather events and\nother natural conditions, and\n(2) The aggregate amount of capitalized costs and charges, excluding recoveries,\nrecognized during the fiscal year as a result of severe weather events and other natural\nconditions.1996\n1995 See supra section II.K.2.b.iv. See also letter from Dell (requesting that the \u201cCommission consider limiting\nArticle 14 of Regulation S-X requirements to physical impacts and related expenditures only\u201d).\n1996 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(c), (d). Under the final rules, disclosure must be provided for the registrant\u2019s most\nrecently completed fiscal year, and to the extent previously disclosed or required to be disclosed, for the\nhistorical fiscal year(s) included in the consolidated financial statements in the filing. See 17 CFR 210.14-\n01(d). In addition, foreign private issuers that file consolidated financial statements under home country\nGAAP and reconcile to U.S. GAAP, would be required to use U.S. GAAP (including the provisions of the\nfinal rules) as the basis for calculating and disclosing this information. Foreign private issuers that file\nconsolidated financial statements under IFRS as issued by the IASB, would apply IFRS and the final rules\nas the basis for calculating and disclosing the financial statement effects. See also infra note 2380 which\ndiscusses proposed amendments to Form 20-F.\n457\n\nThe proposed rules would have required registrants to disclose costs and expenditures\nincurred to \u201cmitigate the risks from severe weather events and other natural conditions.\u201d1997\nSome commenters indicated that it would be feasible, and significantly less burdensome, to\ninstead segregate and quantify discrete costs incurred due to severe weather events.1998\nRequiring disclosure of expenditures related to mitigation activities would present challenges for\nregistrants in terms of forecasting and determining their expectations about future severe weather\nevents at the time they are making expenditure decisions. In addition, costs and expenditures\nrelated to mitigation activities may present similar issues to transition activities, which are\ndiscussed in further detail below, because the mitigation of the risks of severe weather events\nmay be only one of several reasons why a company makes a business decision to incur a\nparticular expenditure. Therefore, we have decided to require registrants to disclose capitalized\ncosts, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses incurred \u201cas a result of\u201d severe weather events\nand other natural conditions.1999 The capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and\nlosses that will be disclosed under the final rules are already captured in a registrant\u2019s income\nstatement or balance sheet and measured and reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP or\n1997 See Proposing Release, section II.F.3.\n1998 See, e.g., letters from Dow (stating that direct costs related to property damage and related repair costs as a\nresult of extreme weather events on the U.S. Gulf Coast \u201ccan easily be segregated, analyzed, and quantified\nwithin our current processes\u201d); and Nutrien (stating that if there is a fire at one of its locations that it can\nattribute to a severe weather event it could \u201creadily identify costs associated with demolition, clean-up and\nrebuilding of those physical assets for disclosure\u201d).\n1999 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(c) and (d). Although the proposed Expenditure Metrics only required the disclosure\nof costs and expenditures related to the mitigation of risks from severe weather events and other natural\nconditions, the proposed Financial Impact Metrics would have required registrants to disclose costs and\nexpenditures incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions because those costs\nwould have constituted line-item impacts to a registrant\u2019s financial statements. Therefore, the requirement\nto disclose costs and expenditures incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions\nis a subset of the information that was included in the proposal.\n458\n\nIFRS.2000 Thus, this approach will be less costly and burdensome for registrants as compared to\nthe proposed rules.\nIn response to commenter requests for additional clarity,2001 we are prescribing an\nattribution principle that registrants must use to determine whether a capitalized cost,\nexpenditure expensed, charge, or loss is \u201cas a result of\u201d a severe weather event or other natural\ncondition.2002 The attribution principle will also simplify the determination of the amount\nrequired to be disclosed by eliminating the need to allocate portions of costs and expenditures,\nwhich will reduce compliance costs for registrants.2003\nUnder the final rules, the requirement to disclose capitalized costs, expenditures\nexpensed, charges, and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural\nconditions remains subject to a one percent disclosure threshold; however, we are modifying the\ndenominators used for the threshold and adopting de minimis thresholds that exempt disclosure\nof amounts that aggregate to less than $100,000 in the income statement or less than $500,000 in\nthe balance sheet, as explained in greater detail below.2004 In addition, under the final rules,\nregistrants must separately disclose, as part of the required contextual information, any\nrecoveries resulting from severe weather events and other natural conditions to reflect the net\n2000 See, e.g., letter from KPMG (\u201cWe recommend that the final rule clarify that the required disclosures are\nindeed a disaggregation of amounts already recognized in the financial statements.\u201d).\n2001 See supra note 1912 and accompanying text.\n2002 The attribution principle is discussed in greater detail below in section II.K.3.c.iii. See also 17 CFR 210.14-\n02(g).\n2003 See id. The attribution principle will also apply to recoveries, which are discussed in greater detail below\nin section II.K.3.c.iv. See also 17 CFR 210.14-02(f) and (g).\n2004 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(b).\n459\n\neffect that severe weather events and other natural conditions have on a registrant\u2019s financial\nstatements.2005\nAs proposed, the Expenditure Metrics would have required registrants to disclose\nseparately the aggregate amount of expenditure expensed and the aggregate amount of\ncapitalized costs.2006 In a shift from the proposal, the final rules require registrants to separately\ndisclose where on the income statement and balance sheet, as applicable, the capitalized costs,\nexpenditures expensed, charges, and losses are presented.2007 As explained above, significantly\nfewer line items are impacted by the final rules we are adopting than would have been impacted\nby a requirement to disclose the proposed Financial Impact Metrics. Only those line items that\nreflect capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses fall within the scope of the\ndisclosures, as is further illustrated below in section II.K.3.c.vii. For example, we do not expect\nthat gross revenues would be impacted under the final rules. In addition, we do not believe that\nrequiring registrants to disclose in which line item each of the required capitalized costs,\nexpenditures expensed, charges, and losses are presented will increase the burden as compared to\nthe proposed Expenditure Metrics because the disclosures required under the final rules are\nsimply a disaggregation of financial statement line items. Requiring registrants to separately\ndisclose in which line item the capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses are\npresented will enhance the usefulness of the disclosures for investors by allowing them to\nunderstand the effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions on a registrant\u2019s\n2005 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(f). See infra section II.K.6.a.iii for further discussion of the requirement to disclose\ncontextual information.\n2006 See Proposing Release, section II.F.3.\n2007 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(c), (d), and (e)(1).\n460\n\nfinancial position and performance. This information will facilitate their analyses and cash flow\nprojections year-on-year and across registrants.\nThe proposed rules would have required registrants to disclose expenditures expensed\nand capitalized costs incurred to reduce GHG emissions or otherwise mitigate exposure to\ntransition risks.2008 With respect to transition activities, many commenters pointed out that\nregistrants make business decisions, such as incurring an expenditure to purchase a piece of\nmachinery that is more energy efficient, for multiple reasons, and as a result, a registrant\u2019s\ntransition activities may be inextricably intertwined with its ordinary business activities.2009\nConsequently, commenters raised concerns about registrants\u2019 abilities to identify, attribute, and\nquantify the impact of transition activities on the financial statements.2010 In addition, requiring\ndisclosure for transition activities would present challenges for registrants in terms of forecasting\nand determining their expectations about transition activities at the time they are making\nexpenditure decisions. Taking these comments into consideration, we have determined not to\nrequire registrants to disclose costs and expenditures related to general transition activities in the\nfinancial statements at this time.\nAlthough we are not adopting the broader requirement for disclosure of transition\nactivities in the financial statements, registrants will be required to disclose capitalized costs,\nexpenditures expensed, and losses related to the purchase and use of carbon offsets and RECs in\nthe financial statements.2011 The proposed rules identified the amount of expensed or capitalized\n2008 See Proposing Release, section II.F.3.\n2009 See supra note 1892 and accompanying text.\n2010 See supra notes 1902 and 1907 and accompanying text.\n2011 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(e). See also 17 CFR 229.1500(a) and (m) (defining \u201ccarbon offsets\u201d and\n\u201crenewable energy credits or certificates\u201d).\n461\n\ncost, as applicable, related to \u201coffset emissions (purchase of energy credits)\u201d as one example of\nthe disclosures that may be required2012 and the purchase and use of carbon offsets and RECs is a\ntype of transition activity that does not present the definitional or scoping concerns presented by\ntransition activities more generally. In addition, carbon offsets and RECs that are expensed or\ncapitalized are discrete transactions that are currently captured in a registrant\u2019s income statement\nor balance sheet.2013 Moreover, requiring the disclosure of capitalized costs, expenditures\nexpensed, and losses related to the acquisition and use of carbon offsets and RECs will\ncomplement the disclosures regarding carbon offsets and RECs required by the amendments to\nRegulation S-K that we are adopting in this release.2014\nFurthermore, although the final rules under Article 14 do not require registrants to\ndisclose costs and expenditures incurred to reduce GHG emissions or otherwise mitigate\nexposure to transition risks in the financial statements, the final rules under subpart 1500 of\nRegulation S-K will require registrants to provide quantitative and qualitative disclosure of\nmaterial expenditures in certain circumstances as described in greater detail above,2015 which\nshould result in the disclosure of some of the information for expenditures related to transition\nactivities that we would have expected to be disclosed under the proposed rules, albeit outside of\nthe financial statements. Requiring the disclosure of these expenditures outside of the financial\nstatements and subject to materiality rather than a bright-line threshold, among other things,\nshould mitigate the compliance burden and related concerns raised by commenters with respect\n2012 See Proposing Release, section II.F.3.\n2013 There is currently a diversity in practice in accounting for carbon offsets and RECs. See infra note 2110.\n2014 See supra note 2023.\n2015 See supra sections II.D.2.c (transition plan disclosure) and II.G.3.a (targets and goals disclosure).\n462\n\nto the proposed requirement to disclose transition expenditures in the financial statements.2016\nWhile we are adopting the requirements to disclose expenditures related to transition activities\noutside the financial statements, we remind registrants that current accounting standards may\nrequire the disclosure of material expenditures within the financial statements,2017 which may\ninclude material expenditures incurred in furtherance of a registrant\u2019s transition activities,\ndepending upon the application of these current accounting standards. Current accounting\nstandards specify minimum presentation and disclosure requirements. Importantly, however, the\nFASB\u2019s Conceptual Framework provides additional guidance for evaluating whether financial\ninformation is representationally faithful. In particular, the Conceptual Framework states \u201c[t]o\nbe a perfectly faithful representation,\u201d a depiction \u201cwould be complete, neutral and free from\nerror.\u201d The Conceptual Framework further states, \u201c[a] complete depiction includes all\ninformation necessary for a user to understand the phenomenon being depicted, including all\nnecessary descriptions and explanations\u201d2018 (emphasis added). Accordingly, additional\ndisaggregation and disclosure of material expenditures, whether on the face of the primary\nfinancial statements or in the notes to the financial statements, may be needed to meet the\n2016 See supra section II.D.2.c. for additional discussion of how these revisions mitigate the compliance\nburdens.\n2017 See, e.g., ASC 230 Statement of Cash flows (requiring classification of cash receipts and cash payments as\nresulting from operating, investing, and financing activities); ASC 280 Segments (noting that a registrant\n\u201cshall disclose both of the following about each reportable segment if the specified amounts are included in\nthe determination of segment assets reviewed by the chief operating decision maker or are otherwise\nregularly provided to the chief operating decision maker, even if not included in the determination of\nsegment assets \u2026(b) total expenditures for additions to long-lived assets\u2026\u201d) (ASC 280-10-50-25); and\nASC 730 Research and Development (requiring disclosure of the total research and development costs\ncharged to expense in each period for which an income statement is presented) (ASC 730-10-50-1).\n2018 See FASB, Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 8 \u2013 Conceptual Framework for Financial\nReporting \u2013 Chapter 3, Qualitative Characteristics of Useful Financial Information (As Amended) (Aug.\n2018), para. QC12 \u2013 QC13.\n463\n\nobjective of the financial reporting as explained by the Conceptual Framework.2019 For example,\na registrant may consider whether disaggregating material cash outflows to acquire property,\nplant, and equipment2020 purchased to meet the registrant\u2019s transition plans, targets, or goals on\nthe statement of cash flows or in a related note is appropriate to provide complete information\nabout the entity\u2019s cash flows for the period.\nUnder the final rules, registrants are required to disclose the aggregate amounts of (1)\ncarbon offsets and RECs expensed, (2) carbon offsets and RECs capitalized, and (3) losses\nincurred on the capitalized carbon offsets and RECs during the fiscal year.2021 This disclosure\nrequirement is not subject to the one percent disclosure threshold that applies to the disclosure of\nsevere weather events and other natural conditions. Instead, disclosure is required if carbon\noffsets or RECs have been used as a material component of a registrant\u2019s plan to achieve\ndisclosed climate-related targets or goals,2022 which is consistent with the requirement to disclose\ninformation about carbon offsets and RECs included in the amendments to Regulation S-K that\nwe are adopting in this release and therefore will help limit the burden for registrants and avoid\nconfusion for investors.2023 In addition, registrants are required to disclose the beginning and\nending balances of capitalized carbon offsets and RECs on the balance sheet for the fiscal\nyear.2024 The beginning and ending balances are currently existing information in a registrant\u2019s\n2019 See FASB, Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 8 \u2013 Conceptual Framework for Financial\nReporting \u2013 Chapter 1, The Objective of General Purpose Financial Reporting (As Amended) (Dec. 2021).\n2020 ASC 230-10-45-13.\n2021 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(e).\n2022 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(e)(1).\n2023 See 17 CFR 229.1504(d) (requiring the disclosure of certain information regarding carbon offsets or RECs\n\u201cif carbon offsets or RECs have been used as a material component of a registrant\u2019s plan to achieve\nclimate-related targets or goals\u201d).

Registrants are also required to disclose where on the income\nstatement or balance sheet the capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, and losses related to\ncarbon offsets and RECs are presented under the final rules.2025\nOne commenter stated that the proposed rules would likely require many smaller issuers\nto make significant upgrades to their cash outflow tracking infrastructure.2026 The commenter\nidentified upgrades that would be needed to cash outflow tracking infrastructure to capture the\ncosts and investments for each separate risk, transition activity, and weather event.2027\nHowever, as discussed above, the final rules will not require disclosure of the proposed Financial\nImpact Metrics or costs and expenditures related to transition activities in the financial\nstatements. Rather, the amendments to Regulation S-X have been narrowed to focus on severe\nweather events and other natural conditions and carbon offsets and RECs, which will be less\nburdensome for registrants. Furthermore, the final rules do not require any disclosure of the\nimpacts to the statement of cash flows.\nWe did not include in the final rules the proposed requirement for a registrant to disclose\nthe impact of any climate-related risks identified by the registrant pursuant to proposed Item\n1502(a) on any of the financial metrics included in the proposed rules, including the proposed\nExpenditure Metrics.2028 A few commenters sought clarification about the scope of this\n2025 See id.\n2026 See supra note 1975 and accompanying text.\n2027 See id.\n2028 See Proposing Release, section II.F.2.\n465\n\nproposed requirement or questioned what disclosure objective it was intended to achieve.2029\nBecause the final rules we are adopting are more narrowly focused on requiring the disclosure of\ncapitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses incurred as a result of severe\nweather events and other natural conditions, we do not think it would be in keeping with this\napproach to also require a registrant to disclose the impacts from any climate-related risks\nidentified by the registrant pursuant to Item 1502(a).\nWe recognize that a number of commenters expressed support for the Expenditure\nMetrics as proposed, including some who stated that the proposed requirements would provide\ninvestors with important information about \u201clong term investments in asset resiliency\u201d or would\nhelp investors understand a registrant\u2019s ability to meet its climate-related targets and goals.2030\nAlthough the final rule is more narrow in scope than the proposal, the information elicited by the\nfinal rules will provide investors with comparable, reliable, and decision-useful information\nabout registrants\u2019 capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses related to severe\nweather events and other natural conditions, which will serve to protect investors, while\nminimizing costs and burdens on registrants.\nii. Disclosure Threshold (Rule 14-02(b))\nIn the final rules, we are retaining a quantitative disclosure threshold for capitalized costs,\nexpenditures expensed, charges, and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and\nother natural conditions.2031 Providing a bright-line standard for registrants will simplify\n2029 See, e.g., letters from ABA; Amer. for Fin. Reform, Sunrise Project et al.; and Deloitte & Touche. See also\nletter from Travelers (Mar. 10, 2023) (objecting to the proposed requirement for a registrant to disclose the\nimpact of any climate-related risks identified by the registrant pursuant to proposed Item 1502(a) on any of\nthe financial metrics included in the proposed rule).\n2030 See supra notes 1966 and 1967 and accompanying text.\n2031 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(b).\n466\n\ncompliance compared to a more principles-based standard, reduce the risk of underreporting\nsuch information, and promote comparability and consistency among a registrant\u2019s filings over\ntime and among different registrants.2032 Accordingly, the final rules require disclosure of:\n(1) Expenditures expensed as incurred and losses if the aggregate amount of such\nexpenditures expensed as incurred and losses equals or exceeds one percent of the\nabsolute value of income or loss before income tax expense or benefit for the relevant\nfiscal year; and\n(2) Capitalized costs and charges recognized if the aggregate amount of the absolute\nvalue of capitalized costs and charges recognized equals or exceeds one percent of the\nabsolute value of stockholders\u2019 equity or deficit, at the end of the relevant fiscal\nyear.2033\nSuch disclosure is not required, however, if the aggregate amount of expenditures expensed and\nlosses as incurred in the income statement is less than $100,000 for the relevant fiscal year.2034\nWith respect to the balance sheet, registrants are not required to provide disclosure if the\naggregate amount of capitalized costs and charges is less than $500,000 for the relevant fiscal\nyear.2035\nIn a shift from the proposal, we are using different denominators for the disclosure\nthresholds. Specifically, the denominators we are adopting are: (1) income or loss before income\ntax expense or benefit, and (2) stockholders\u2019 equity or deficit.2036 Income or loss before income\n2032 See Proposing Release, section II.F.2.\n2033 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(b).\n2034 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(b)(1).\n2035 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(b)(2).\n2036 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(b).\n467\n\ntax expense or benefit is a frequently disclosed line item on the income statement that provides\nan accounting-based measure of financial performance. Stockholders\u2019 equity or deficit is a\ndisclosed line item in the balance sheet that reflects stockholders\u2019 ownership interest in the book\nvalue of the registrant and represents the net difference between the assets and liabilities of the\nregistrant.\nAlthough we did not receive commenter feedback specifically objecting to the\ndenominators for the proposed Expenditure Metrics (i.e., \u201ctotal expenditure expensed\u201d or \u201ctotal\ncapitalized costs\u201d), we have decided to use these alternative denominators because income or\nloss before income tax expense or benefit and stockholders\u2019 equity or deficit are well known and\nunderstood by registrants and investors and are easily calculable based on line items in the\nfinancial statements that are defined under U.S. GAAP and IFRS.2037 These alternative\ndenominators are broadly responsive to commenters who raised concerns that the proposed rules\nwould be inconsistent with existing GAAP2038 or would not result in comparable disclosure,2039\nalthough neither of these concerns was specifically directed at the proposed denominators for the\ndisclosure threshold. Since the line items we have chosen for the denominators in the final rules\nare well known and represent aggregated financial activity, we expect at least some companies\nwill have insight into the expected amount or magnitude of these denominators in advance of the\nend of the fiscal year, which could help facilitate the establishment of internal accounting\n2037 For example, while some registrants are not explicitly required to present income or loss before income tax\nexpense or benefit in accordance with 17 CFR 210.5-03.10 in their financial statements, U.S. GAAP\nincludes presentation and disclosure requirements that result in information sufficient to calculate income\nor loss before income tax expense or benefit, and registrants often do present this amount. In addition,\nwhile IFRS does not explicitly require income or loss before income tax expense or benefit, the standards\ndo require disclosure of profit or loss and income tax expense.\n2038 See supra note 1797 and accompanying text.\n2039 See supra note 1793 and accompanying text.\n468\n\ncontrols related to the required disclosure and support the establishment of ICFR and accurate\nand timely disclosure.2040 In addition, as mentioned above, income or loss before income tax\nexpense or benefit is a measure of profitability, and requiring a registrant to disclose\nexpenditures expensed and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural\nconditions will help investors understand the impact these events and conditions had on the\nregistrant\u2019s profitability. Likewise, stockholders\u2019 equity or deficit represents shareholders\u2019\ninterest in the book value of an entity, and requiring a registrant to disclose the capitalized costs\nand charges incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions will help\ninvestors understand the impact these events and conditions have on assets attributable to\nshareholders.\nThe final rules provide that the disclosure thresholds should be calculated using the\nabsolute values of the relevant denominator.2041 We think it is appropriate to use the absolute\nvalues because the balances for these line items may represent debit or credit balances (which are\nnot inherently either positive or negative) in the books and records, and thus using an absolute\nvalue will avoid any confusion that could arise from using a negative number resulting from an\naccounting convention for the disclosure threshold.2042\n2040 Some commenters raised concerns that registrants would not be able to calculate the monetary value for the\n1% disclosure threshold until the end of the relevant period, which would require registrants to evaluate\nevery transaction to determine if it counts towards the threshold. See supra note 1814 and accompanying\ntext. Our decision to use income or loss before income tax expense or benefit and shareholders\u2019 equity or\ndeficit as the denominators in the final rules should mitigate this concern to some extent for registrants\nbecause we expect that many registrants will have insight into the magnitude of these denominators prior to\nthe end of the fiscal year.\n2041 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(b).\n2042 Other rules in Regulation S-X use absolute values in determining whether a threshold has been exceeded.\nSee 17 CFR 210.1-02(w) (setting forth the income test for determining whether a subsidiary is a significant\nsubsidiary).\n469\n\nIn addition, the final rules require registrants to use the absolute value of capitalized costs\nand charges recognized for the numerator to determine whether the applicable disclosure\nthreshold is triggered for the balance sheet disclosures since capitalized costs and charges can\noffset one another.2043 Expenditures expensed as incurred and losses in the income statement do\nnot offset one another and therefore the use of absolute values is unnecessary to determine\nwhether the applicable disclosure threshold is triggered. Although the proposed Expenditure\nMetrics did not use absolute values in the numerator to determine whether the applicable\ndisclosure threshold was triggered,2044 the proposed Financial Impact Metrics did, and\ncommenter feedback on the use of absolute values in that context was varied. A few\ncommenters supported using the absolute value, and one investor stated that the absolute value\nwould better reflect the significance of the impact on a registrant\u2019s financial performance and\nposition.2045 On the other hand, a few commenters objected to using the absolute value and\nstated it could result in the disclosure of individually immaterial information.2046 We agree with\nthe commenter that stated using the absolute value to determine whether the disclosure threshold\nis triggered will better reflect the significance of the impact on a registrant\u2019s financial position\nbecause the absolute value takes into account each of the relevant capitalized costs or charges\n(i.e., the full magnitude of the costs or charges), whereas a net amount would not necessarily\nreflect the total effect on the registrant.\n2043 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(b)(2).\n2044 As explained above, the proposed Expenditure Metrics did not require the disclosure of charges, and\ntherefore there was no potential for offsetting, although charges would have been required disclosures\nunder the proposed Financial Impact Metrics. See supra note 1732.\n2045 See supra note 1856 and accompanying text.\n2046 See supra note 1854 and accompanying text.\n470\n\nIn a further shift from the proposal, we have included de minimis thresholds in the final\nrules.2047 As discussed above, some commenters expressed the view that the proposed one\npercent disclosure threshold would place an unreasonable burden on smaller companies because\nit is more likely that the impacts on smaller companies would exceed the one percent disclosure\nthreshold.2048 In addition, a few commenters mentioned a de minimis exception in their\nletters.2049 We recognize the possibility that a one percent disclosure threshold could be\ndisproportionately burdensome for smaller companies or companies in the early stages of\ndeveloping a product or business line for which one percent of income or loss before income tax\nexpense or benefit or stockholders\u2019 equity or deficit could be a very small amount. In addition to\nsmaller companies, we think de minimis thresholds will also be helpful for companies that have\nincome or loss before income tax expense or benefit near breakeven in a particular year, perhaps\ndue to anomalous circumstances. Therefore, we have included in the final rules de minimis\nthresholds of: (1) $100,000 for expenditures expensed as incurred and losses in the income\nstatement, and (2) $500,000 for capitalized costs and charges recognized on the balance\nsheet.2050 As a practical matter, this means that, under the final rules, registrants for which one\npercent of the absolute value of income or loss before income tax expense or benefit is less than\n$100,000 will not have to provide disclosure until the aggregate amount of expenditures\nexpensed and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions\n2047 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(b).\n2048 See supra note 1823 and accompanying text.\n2049 See letter from NAM (\u201cThe extreme burden of building new processes and systems to track quantitative\nclimate impacts, with no materiality threshold or even a de minimis exception for minor events or\nimmaterial impacts, would impose colossal costs and strain resources at all public companies.\u201d). See also\nletter from Cleveland Cliffs (stating a similar view).\n2050 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(b). There is precedent in Regulation S-X for using $100,000 as a de minimis\nthreshold. See 17 CFR 210.3-11 (permitting a registrant to submit unaudited financial statements if gross\nreceipts and expenditures are not in excess of $100,000).\n471\n\nequals or exceeds $100,000.2051 Similarly, under the final rules, registrants for which one\npercent of the absolute value of stockholders\u2019 equity or deficit is less than $500,000 will not have\nto provide disclosure until the absolute value of the aggregate amount of capitalized costs and\ncharges incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions equals or\nexceeds $500,000.2052 We have decided to use a higher de minimis threshold for capitalized\ncosts and charges recognized on the balance sheet because generally the disclosure threshold\napplicable to the balance sheet\u2014one percent of the absolute value of stockholders\u2019 equity or\ndeficit\u2014will result in larger numbers than the disclosure threshold applicable to the income\nstatement, and therefore a larger de minimis threshold is appropriate and proportionate.\nMoreover, as noted below in section IV, in 2022 the $100,000 de minimis value for the income\nstatement would have exceeded one percent of income or loss before income tax expense or\nbenefit for approximately 17% of registrants, and the $500,000 de minimis value for the balance\nsheet would have exceeded one percent of stockholders\u2019 equity or deficit for approximately 24%\nof registrants. Thus, approximately the same number of companies will benefit from the de\nminimis thresholds by using these values.\nWhile a number of commenters asserted that requiring disclosure at a one percent\nthreshold would result in an excessive amount of immaterial detail for investors, the changes we\n2051 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(b)(1). For example, if a registrant had $5 million in income or loss before income\ntax expense or benefit for the relevant fiscal year, the registrant\u2019s disclosure threshold for the income\nstatement would be $50,000 ($5,000,000 x .01= $50,000). Since $50,000 falls below the $100,000 de\nminimis threshold, the registrant would not be required to provide the disclosure required by Rule 14-\n02(b)(1) and (c) until the aggregate amount of expenditures expensed as incurred and losses equals or\nexceeds $100,000 (i.e., the de minimis threshold).\n2052 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(b)(2). For example, if a registrant had $25 million in stockholders\u2019 equity or deficit\nfor the relevant fiscal year, the registrant\u2019s disclosure threshold for the balance sheet would be $250,000\n($25,000,000 x .01=$250,000). Since $250,000 falls below the $500,000 de minimis threshold, the\nregistrant would not be required to provide the disclosure required by Rule 14-02(b)(2) and (d) until the\naggregate amount of capitalized costs and charges equals or exceeds $500,000 (i.e., the de minimis\nthreshold).\n472\n\nhave made from the proposal address this concern.2053 Specifically, the final rules require\ndisclosure of specific categories of discrete capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges,\nand losses, which in our view is unlikely to result in immaterial disclosure. As discussed in\ngreater detail below, the final rules also include an attribution principle that limits the required\ndisclosure to circumstances where the severe weather event or other natural condition was a\nsignificant contributing factor in incurring the capitalized cost, expenditure expensed, charge, or\nloss.2054 The final rules include de minimis thresholds, and the denominators used in the final\nrules\u2014stockholders\u2019 equity or deficit and income or loss before income tax expense or benefit\u2014\nare aggregated amounts and therefore we expect that in many instances they will result in a\nlarger denominator than what was included in the proposal. Given the narrower scope of the\nfinal rules, the one percent threshold should not result in an excessive amount of detail or\nimmaterial disclosure. Some commenters also raised concerns that the one percent disclosure\nthreshold could confuse investors by giving too much prominence to the climate-related\ndisclosures relative to the impacts of other risks disclosed in the financial statements or could\nsuggest a level of precision that does not exist.2055 However, the final rules require disclosure of\ncapitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses that are currently recorded in a\nregistrant\u2019s financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and therefore the disclosures should\nhave the same degree of precision as the other information provided in the financial statements.\nMoreover, the required disclosures will be in a note to the financial statements along with other\n2053 See supra note 1809 and accompanying text.\n2054 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(g) and infra Section II.K.3.c.iii.\n2055 See supra notes 1810 and 1811 and accompanying text.\n473\n\ndisaggregated disclosures addressing a variety of topics, and therefore its placement will be on\nequal footing with other information included in such notes.\nOther commenters stated that applying the one percent disclosure threshold on a line-item\nbasis could result in only partial disclosure of expenditures related to a climate-related event\nsince the impact could be recorded in multiple financial statement line items\u2014for which the\ndisclosure threshold may not be triggered\u2014which would diminish the usefulness of the\ninformation to investors.2056 Our decision not to adopt the proposed Financial Impact Metrics\nshould alleviate this concern to a great extent. However, it remains true that, under the final\nrules, the application of the disclosure threshold separately to (i) capitalized costs and charges in\nthe balance sheet, and (ii) expenditures expensed and losses in the income statement could result\nin a situation where the threshold for only one of the financial statements is triggered and certain\ncosts related to a particular severe weather event or other natural condition may not be required\nto be disclosed. We acknowledge that in some circumstances this may result in investors only\nreceiving a partial picture of the financial statement effects of a particular event or condition;\nhowever, applying the disclosure threshold separately to the income statement and the balance\nsheet will be more straightforward for registrants to implement and therefore will help to limit\nthe overall burden of the final rules. Moreover, registrants are not prohibited from disclosing\nhow the severe weather event or other natural condition affected both the income statement and\nbalance sheet, even if the disclosure threshold for one of the financial statements is not triggered.\nOne commenter suggested that a registrant could \u201cgame\u201d the rules by classifying costs as\nexpenditures, rather than capitalizing costs, to avoid triggering the disclosure threshold.2057 We\n2056 See supra note 1813.\n2057 See supra note 1991.\n474\n\nthink the likelihood of this occurring is low because registrants are required to follow GAAP in\ndetermining whether to expense a cost or capitalize it and these amounts will be subject to audit.\nCertain commenters argued that the Commission should apply a different percentage\nthreshold, such as five or ten percent.2058 Although we considered those options, in light of the\nother changes we are making to the disclosure threshold, such as using an aggregated\ndenominator and including a de minimis threshold, we think one percent will generally not result\nin immaterial disclosure nor result in undue burdens on registrants. In this regard, we agree with\nthose commenters who stated that the appropriate percentage threshold depends upon what is\nused as the denominator.2059 For the same reason, we considered, but are not adopting, the other\nalternative disclosure thresholds that commenters suggested, such as only using a dollar\nthreshold or requiring the disclosure of all relevant expenditures.2060\nCertain commenters stated that the examples provided in the Proposing Release of other\none percent disclosure thresholds were not analogous.2061 Generally, these commenters\nsuggested that the examples were not analogous, at least in part, because they involved amounts\nthat are knowable under current accounting practice and have discrete impacts on a smaller\nnumber of larger line items (as opposed to every line item).2062 Although the alignment with\n2058 See supra notes 1837 and 1838 and accompanying text.\n2059 See supra note 1839 and accompanying text.\n2060 See supra notes 1846 and 1848 and accompanying text.\n2061 See supra note 1817.\n2062 See, e.g., letters from BHP (\u201cFurther, while we acknowledge that the Commission currently uses a specific\n1% threshold for certain disclosures, we note that the disclosure examples provided by the Commission are\ngenerally narrow in scope, factual in nature and limited to certain line items in the financial statements (for\nexample, the amount of excise taxes included in revenue)\u201d); Ernst & Young LLP (\u201cBut we note that, unlike\nthe climate-related impacts, excise taxes are discrete event charges that are easily calculated and tracked in\na registrant\u2019s accounting books and records.\u201d); and IADC (\u201cThe Commission argues that a 1% quantitative\nthreshold is used in other contexts, but the examples the Commission cites are circumstances where the\nquantitative amounts involved are knowable under current accounting practice, have discrete impacts on\nspecific financial line items, and address scenarios in which more detailed disclosure is appropriate.\u201d).\n475\n\nother disclosure thresholds is not dispositive of whether a threshold elicits appropriate disclosure\nfor investors, the final rules\u2019 focus on requiring the disclosure of amounts that are currently\nrecorded in a registrant\u2019s financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that pertain to a\nsignificantly smaller number of line items (as well as the revisions made to the denominators for\nthe disclosure thresholds) should align the final rules more closely with other instances where the\nCommission has used a one percent or other numerical disclosure threshold.2063\nWe have considered the feedback we received from commenters urging the Commission\nto forgo the one percent disclosure threshold and instead require disclosure only if material.2064\nWe agree that the concept of materiality plays an important role in the Federal securities laws.\nAs such, as discussed above, we have significantly modified the scope of the proposed\ndisclosures and the proposed disclosure threshold and have included de minimis exceptions to\nfocus the final requirements on eliciting material information for investors. We are not,\nhowever, eliminating the threshold entirely and moving to a more principles-based disclosure\nstandard because, as discussed in the Proposing Release,2065 the proposed quantitative disclosure\nthreshold provides registrants with greater clarity in implementing the rules, reduces the risk of\nunderreporting, and increases consistency and comparability. This approach is consistent with\nthe feedback we received from some commenters that expressed concerns about the risks of\nunderreporting in the context of the financial statements, as evidenced by the limited climate-\n2063 As noted in the Proposing Release, Regulation S-X (and other aspects of the Federal securities laws)\nincludes a variety of different percentage thresholds prescribing disaggregated disclosure\u2013rather than\nrelying only on principles-based materiality thresholds. See, e.g., 17 CFR 210.5-03.1(a) (stating that if the\ntotal sales and revenues reported under this caption includes excise taxes in an amount equal to 1% or more\nof such total, the amount of such excise taxes shall be shown on the face of the statement parenthetically or\notherwise); 17 CFR 210.5-02.8 (requiring registrants to state separately, in the balance sheet or a note\nthereto, any amounts in excess of 5% of total current assets).\n2064 See supra note 1827 and accompanying text.\n2065 See Proposing Release, section II.F.2.\n476\n\nrelated disclosure under current accounting standards despite increasing demand by investors for\nsuch disclosure.2066\nWe agree with, and further emphasize, the point made by those commenters who asserted\nthat registrants are already required to disclose the financial statement effect of material climate\nrisks under existing rules.2067 Registrants currently have an obligation to consider material\nimpacts on the financial statements, and the fact that a material impact may be driven by climate-\nrelated matters does not alter a registrant\u2019s obligation.2068 The Commission and accounting\nstandard-setting bodies and their staff have all reminded registrants, through the issuance of\nguidance, of existing accounting and disclosure requirements that may apply to climate-related\nmatters when there is a material impact on the financial statements.2069 Although the final rules\nrequire registrants to disclose certain expenditures if they exceed the one percent disclosure\n2066 See supra note 1833. But see, e.g., letter from M. Winden (suggesting increased enforcement to the extent\nunderreporting exists).\n2067 See supra note 1716 and accompanying text. See also letter from CFA Institute (\u201cWe would also observe\nthat existing U.S. GAAP and IFRS standards\u2014as highlighted in publications by the FASB and IASB, as\nnoted by the SEC in the Proposal\u2014require consideration of climate-related risks in the measurement of\nvarious financial statement estimates.\u201d).\n2068 For example, although U.S. GAAP and IFRS Accounting Standards do not refer explicitly to climate-\nrelated matters, registrants have an obligation to consider material impacts when applying, for example,\nFASB ASC Topic 330 Inventory (IAS 2 Inventories) and FASB ASC Topic 360 Property, Plant, and\nEquipment (IAS 36 Impairment of Assets). See also supra note 2069.\n2069 See, e.g., 2010 Guidance (stating that \u201cregistrants must also consider any financial statement implications\nof climate change issues in accordance with applicable accounting standards, including [FASB ASC] Topic\n450, Contingencies, and [FASB ASC] Topic 275, Risks and Uncertainties.\u201d); FASB Staff Educational\nPaper, Intersection of Environmental, Social, and Governance Matters with Financial Accounting\nStandards (Mar. 2021), available at\nhttps://www.fasb.org/Page/ShowPdf?path=FASB_Staff_ESG_Educational_Paper_FINAL.pdf (\u201cWhen\napplying the financial accounting standards, an entity must consider the effects of certain material ESG\nmatters, similar to how an entity considers other changes in business and operating environment that have a\nmaterial direct or indirect effect on the financial statements and notes thereto.\u201d); IFRS, Effects of climate-\nrelated matters on financial statements (Nov. 2020 and July 2023), available at\nhttps://www.ifrs.org/content/dam/ifrs/supporting-implementation/documents/effects-of-climate-related-\nmatters-on-financial-statements.pdf (stating that the IFRS has re-published \u201cthis educational material to\nremind stakeholders of the long-standing requirements in IFRS Accounting Standards to report on the\neffects of climate-related matters in the financial statements when those effects are material.\u201d).\n477\n\nthreshold, that requirement does not affect registrants\u2019 ongoing responsibility to consider\nmaterial impacts, whether climate-related or not, when preparing their financial statements and\nrelated disclosures.2070 This may include determining whether costs and expenditures that do not\ntrigger the disclosure threshold may be material to the registrant, taking into consideration all\nrelevant quantitative and qualitative factors.2071\niii. Attribution Principle (Rule 14-02(g))\nA number of commenters raised concerns about the ability of registrants to isolate,\nattribute, and quantify expenditures related to severe weather events and other natural\nconditions.2072 In response to these concerns, we are adopting a principle for attributing a cost,\nexpenditure, charge, loss, or recovery to a severe weather event or other natural condition and for\ndetermining the amount to be disclosed. The final rules (Rule 14-02(g)) require a registrant to\nattribute a cost, expenditure, charge, loss, or recovery to a severe weather event or other natural\ncondition and disclose the entire amount of the expenditure or recovery when the event or\ncondition is a significant contributing factor in incurring the cost, expenditure, charge, loss, or\nrecovery.2073\nSome commenters suggested that registrants should be permitted to make a reasonable\nestimate and disclose the assumptions that resulted in the estimate, or suggested that the\n2070 See id. Notwithstanding the final rules\u2019 1% disclosure threshold, registrants have a fundamental obligation\nnot to make materially misleading statements or omissions in their disclosures and may need to provide\nsuch additional information as is necessary to keep their disclosures from being misleading. See 17 CFR\n230.408 and 17 CFR 240.12b-20.\n2071 See Concept Release (discussing materiality in the context of, among other matters, restating financial\nstatements). See also Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99 (Aug. 12, 1999), available at\nhttps://www.sec.gov/interps/account/sab99.htm (emphasizing that a registrant or an auditor may not\nsubstitute a percentage threshold for a materiality determination that is required by applicable accounting\nprinciples).\n2072 See supra notes 1902 and 1907 and accompanying text.\n2073 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(g).\n478\n\nCommission did not need to prescribe a particular approach to attribution or quantification\nbecause registrants already have experience allocating costs across risks when preparing\nfinancial statements.2074 Although we considered those possibilities, we are adopting\n\u201csignificant contributing factor\u201d as the attribution principle for the final rules, which was\nrecommended by a commenter.2075 We think it is appropriate to do so for a number of reasons.\nFirst, it is important to establish an attribution principle because allowing a registrant to apply an\nentity-specific methodology may not result in consistent or comparable information from one\nregistrant to another which would limit the usefulness of the disclosures to investors. Second,\nthe \u201csignificant contributing factor\u201d principle will strike an appropriate balance by requiring\ndisclosure when a severe weather event or other natural condition was a significant factor\nresulting in the registrant incurring the expenditure or receiving the recovery, while not requiring\ndisclosure where a severe weather event or other natural condition was only a minor factor,\nthereby reducing the cost burden on registrants. Moreover, many areas of U.S. GAAP currently\nrequire a registrant to apply the concept of significance (even though U.S. GAAP does not define\nthe term \u201csignificant\u201d),2076 which should help facilitate registrants\u2019 use of this attribution\nprinciple. Although the application of this attribution principle may require the exercise of\njudgment, financial statement preparers are accustomed to applying judgment in many\ncircumstances under U.S. GAAP, and, as stated above, preparers have experience applying the\n2074 See supra notes 1913 and 1921 and accompanying text.\n2075 See supra note 1918 and accompanying text.\n2076 See, e.g., FASB ASC Topic 280 Segment Reporting, FASB ASC 323 Equity Method and Joint Ventures,\nFASB ASC 810 Consolidations, and FASB ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement.\n479\n\nconcept of significance.2077 Finally, in addition to enhancing consistency and comparability of\nhow the disclosures are developed, specifying an attribution and quantification principle in the\nfinal rules will reduce the burden associated with attributing (since there is no allocation\ninvolved) and quantifying costs and expenditures.\niv. Recoveries (Rule 14-02(f))\nIn addition, the final rules (Rule 14-02(f)) provide that, if a registrant is required to\ndisclose capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, or losses incurred as a result of severe\nweather events and other natural conditions, then it must separately disclose the aggregate\namount of any recoveries recognized during the fiscal year as a result of the severe weather\nevents and other natural conditions for which capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges,\nor losses have been disclosed.2078 Registrants would have been required to disclose the financial\nimpacts of severe weather events and other natural conditions, including the receipt of insurance\nproceeds, as part of the Financial Impact Metrics included in the proposed rules. Although we\nare not adopting the proposed Financial Impact Metrics, along the lines of the proposal, the final\nrules provide that any recoveries should be disclosed as part of the contextual information\nrequired by the rules.2079 Several commenters raised concerns about the treatment of mitigation\n2077 To illustrate the application of the attribution principle, if a tornado damages the roof of a registrant\u2019s\nfactory and the registrant incurs costs to repair the damage, the tornado would be a significant contributing\nfactor in incurring the costs to repair the roof and the registrant would be required to disclose the entire cost\nincurred (if the applicable disclosure threshold is triggered), notwithstanding the fact that if the roof had\nbeen in place for some period of time there could be other factors that contributed to the roof\u2019s condition\nafter the tornado.\n2078 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(f). We expect most recoveries to consist of insurance proceeds; however, we\nappreciate that other transactions or agreements may result in recovery of amounts as a result of severe\nweather events and other natural conditions, such as guarantees or indemnifications, and therefore have not\nlimited the disclosure to only insurance proceeds.\n2079 See id. See infra section II.K.6.a.iii for further discussion of the requirement to disclose contextual\ninformation.\n480\n\nefforts, such as insurance, under the proposed rules.2080 Relatedly, other commenters asserted\nthat registrants should not be permitted to use \u201cnet\u201d amounts to determine whether disclosure is\nrequired under the rules.2081 Having considered those comments, we are persuaded that\npermitting a registrant to use a net amount to determine whether capitalized costs, expenditures\nexpensed, charges, and losses have exceeded the disclosure threshold would be inconsistent with\nthe intent of the rules because the net amount could obscure the magnitude of the financial\neffects of severe weather events and other natural conditions experienced by the registrant. For\nexample, obtaining insurance is a risk mitigation activity that may ultimately result in payment to\nthe registrant for costs and expenditures incurred, but it does not mean that the financial effects\ndid not occur in the first place. The existence of recoveries, such as insurance proceeds, is\nimportant information for investors because without it, investors could be under the\nmisperception that severe weather events and other natural conditions have a greater effect on a\nregistrant\u2019s operations than is the case. Therefore, requiring registrants to disclose whether they\nhave recognized any recoveries, such as insurance proceeds, as a result of the severe weather\nevents and natural conditions for which capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, or\nlosses have been disclosed, will provide investors with information that is important to\nunderstand the financial statement effects of the capitalized costs, expenditures expensed,\ncharges, and losses.2082 In addition, such disclosure will complement other contextual\n2080 See supra note 1858 and accompanying text.\n2081 See supra note 1861 and accompanying text.\n2082 One commenter appeared to suggest that it would be contrary to accounting principles to require registrants\nto disclose costs and expenditures that are not net of insurance proceeds. See letter from Prologis.\nHowever, the final rules do not prescribe how a registrant must account for insurance proceeds in its\nfinancial statements, and registrants should prepare their financial statements in accordance with GAAP.\nRather, the final rules require a registrant to disaggregate certain costs and expenditures in the notes to the\n481\n\ninformation that may be disclosed by a registrant such as a discussion of the composition of the\ncapitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, or losses.2083 Similar to the final rules\u2019 other\ndisclosure requirements, a registrant will be required to identify where the recoveries are\npresented in the income statement and the balance sheet.2084\nv. Severe Weather Events and Other Natural Conditions (Rules 14-02(c)\nand (d))\nA number of commenters requested that the Commission provide additional guidance to\nhelp registrants apply the meaning and scope of \u201csevere weather events and other natural\nconditions.\u201d2085 Some commenters pointed out that the proposed amendments to Regulation S-K\nused the phrase \u201cextreme weather events,\u201d and that the examples of extreme weather events\nprovided in the Proposing Release were different, but overlapping, with the examples of severe\nweather events included in the proposed amendments to Regulation S-X.2086 In response to these\ncomments and to provide greater clarity, the final amendments to Regulation S-K and Regulation\nfinancial statements and require a registrant to disclose separately whether it has recognized any recoveries,\nsuch as insurance proceeds, as part of the contextual information that must be provided to help investors\nunderstand the financial statement effect.\n2083 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(a).\n2084 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(f). Under the final rules it is possible that the disclosure threshold could be\ntriggered for a registrant\u2019s balance sheet, but not its income statement, and vice versa, resulting in only\npartial disclosure of capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses related to severe weather\nevents and other natural conditions incurred during the fiscal year. See supra section II.K.3.c.ii. The final\nrules require a registrant to disclose the aggregate amount of any recoveries recognized during the fiscal\nyear as a result of the severe weather events and other natural conditions for which capitalized costs,\nexpenditures expensed, charges, or losses have been disclosed. See 17 CFR 210.14-02(f). We\nacknowledge that in some circumstances this may result in a registrant only disclosing a portion of its\nexpenditures corresponding to the event or condition that resulted in the recovery, which could create the\nimpression that a registrant\u2019s recoveries for a particular fiscal year exceed its expenditures related to severe\nweather events and other natural conditions. However, as explained above, to the extent this is a concern\nfor an issuer, there is nothing in the final rules that would prevent a registrant from disclosing how the\nsevere weather event or other natural condition affected both the income statement and balance sheet, even\nif the disclosure threshold for one of the financial statements is not triggered. See supra section II.K.3.c.ii.\n2085 See supra note 1865 and accompanying text.\n2086 See supra note 1866 and accompanying text.\n482\n\nS-X both use the phrase \u201csevere weather events.\u201d2087 In addition, both include the same\nexamples; specifically, in a change from the proposal, the examples of severe weather events\nincluded in the final amendments to Regulation S-X include hurricanes and tornadoes.2088 These\nrevisions are consistent with our expectation that there will be significant overlap between the\nsevere weather events and other natural conditions a registrant identifies for purposes of\ndisclosure under Rule 14-02 and the types of physical risks (i.e., acute risks (including severe\nweather events) and chronic risks) a registrant identifies for purposes of disclosure under the\namendments to Regulation S-K.\nHowever, in response to questions raised by commenters,2089 we are clarifying that a\nregistrant is not required to make a determination that a severe weather event or other natural\ncondition was, in fact, caused by climate change in order to trigger the disclosure required by\nRule 14-02 related to such event or condition. Requiring such a determination for severe\nweather events or other natural conditions was not the intent of the proposed amendments to\n2087 See 17 CFR 229.1500 (defining \u201cphysical risks\u201d to include \u201cacute risks\u201d (including severe weather events)\nand \u201cchronic risks\u201d); and 17 CFR 210.14-02 (c), (d), and (h). Although we do not believe there was any\nconfusion about this issue, for the avoidance of doubt, we are confirming that \u201csevere\u201d modifies both the\nweather events and other natural conditions. See 17 CFR 210.14-02(c), (d), and (h).\n2088 See 17 CFR 229.1500; and 17 CFR 210.14-02 (c), (d), and (h). The proposed amendments to Regulation S-\nK included hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, and wildfires as examples of \u201cacute risks\u201d and included sustained\nhigher temperatures, sea level rise, and drought as examples of \u201cchronic risks.\u201d These remain unchanged in\nthe final amendments to Regulation S-K. See 17 CFR 229.1500. As noted above, the final amendments to\nRegulation S-X include hurricanes and tornadoes as examples of severe weather events and other natural\nconditions, in addition to the following examples that were included in the proposed amendments to\nRegulation S-X and remain unchanged in the final rules: flooding, drought, wildfires, extreme\ntemperatures, and sea level rise. We have retained the \u201cextreme temperatures\u201d terminology in the final\namendments to Regulation S-X instead of using the \u201csustained higher temperatures\u201d terminology included\nin the final amendments to Regulation S-K because we want to emphasize that disclosure under Rule 14-02\nis only required if the weather event or other natural condition is \u201csevere.\u201d\n2089 See supra note 1873 and accompanying text.\n483\n\nRegulation S-X, and it is not required by Rule 14-02.2090 In this way, although there is\nsignificant overlap between the disclosure of climate-related physical risks pursuant to\nRegulation S-K and the severe weather events and other natural conditions that a registrant\nidentifies pursuant to Rule 14-02, the events covered by Rule 14-02 would also cover severe\nweather events and other natural conditions that are not necessarily related to climate.2091\nSince Rule 14-02 requires event-based disclosure, the decision not to require a registrant\nto determine whether a severe weather event or other natural condition was caused by climate\nchange should simplify the analysis that a registrant has to undertake to determine whether\ndisclosure is required. We expect that the final rules will elicit disclosure appropriately aligned\nwith the corresponding risk-based Regulation S-K disclosure without presenting the financial-\nstatement specific challenges associated with making a determination about whether particular\nevents relate to climate or climate change.\nThe list of examples of severe weather events and other natural conditions included in\nRule 14-02 is not intended to be exclusive or exhaustive, nor are the examples intended to create\na presumption about whether disclosure is required for those events in every circumstance.2092\nRather, under the final rules, registrants will have the flexibility to determine what constitutes a\n2090 Similarly, a few commenters raised concerns about determining the cause of a wildfire, see supra note\n1886 and accompanying text, but as we have stated, registrants will not be required to determine the cause\nof the severe weather event or natural condition for purposes of providing disclosure under Rule 14-02.\nThe cause of a severe weather event or natural condition is irrelevant in determining whether disclosure is\nrequired under Rules 14-01 and 14-02.\n2091 For example, the \u201cnatural conditions\u201d referenced in Rule 14-02 need not be climate-related, and therefore\nmay include types of non-climate-related occurrences, such as earthquakes, if severe and depending on the\nregistrant\u2019s particular facts and circumstances. See letter from Chamber. In addition to simplifying the\nanalysis for registrants, as discussed below, disclosure of these non-climate-related severe weather events\nand other natural conditions is consistent with the other event-based disclosure reflected in the final\namendments to Regulation S-X and will elicit material information for investors.\n2092 We believe providing examples of severe weather events and other natural conditions will aid in the\ncomparability of the resulting disclosure while assisting issuers in making the disclosures. See Proposing\nRelease, section II.F.2.\n484\n\nsevere weather event or other natural condition based on the particular risks faced by the\nregistrant, taking into consideration the registrant\u2019s geographic location, historical\nexperience,2093 and the financial impact of the event on the registrant, among other factors. We\ndo not agree with those commenters who suggested that we should provide a comprehensive list\nof severe weather events, or refer to a list from another source, because doing so would be\ninconsistent with the dynamic nature of these events.2094 Furthermore, a particular weather event\nmay be \u201csevere\u201d in one region but not in another region.\nWe considered whether the non-exclusive list of examples should be expanded to include\nother types of severe weather events or other natural conditions identified by commenters in their\ncomment letters;2095 however, we designed the list as non-exhaustive and non-exclusive because\nwe think it is more appropriate to take a flexible approach to enable registrants to exercise\njudgment in identifying severe weather events or other natural conditions based on the impacts\nthose events have on their financial condition.\nSome commenters asserted that allowing registrants to exercise judgment about which\nsevere weather events or natural conditions to analyze would reduce comparability.2096\nAlthough more prescriptive requirements can increase comparability, our view is that greater\nflexibility for registrants to determine which severe weather events and other natural conditions\naffect them in light of their particular facts and circumstances will yield better disclosures for\ninvestors compared to a static list of potential events that may or may not be relevant to every\n2093 For example, in determining whether high temperatures constitute a severe natural condition, a relevant\nfactor may include average seasonal temperatures.\n2094 See supra notes 1867 and 1870 and accompanying text.\n2095 See, e.g., letters from Anthesis (cyclones, water stress, severe participation, and severe wind); Chamber\n(earthquakes); Climate Advisers (deforestation); and WSP (water stress).\n2096 See supra note 1872 and accompanying text.\n485\n\nregistrant now and in future years. Additionally, requiring registrants to use a prescribed list of\nevents could lead to significant gaps in disclosure over time. We expect that the final rules will\ngive registrants the flexibility to adopt reasonable approaches to identifying severe weather\nevents and other natural conditions and adapt to changing circumstances. As a result, the final\nrules provide a level of flexibility that even a regularly updated, prescribed list of events would\nbe unable to match\u2014resulting in what we believe is appropriate, decision-useful information to\ninvestors.\nSome commenters raised questions about how to identify the beginning and ending dates\nof severe weather events and how to disclose weather events where the impact from the weather\nevent may continue into the future.2097 We have streamlined the final rules to focus on requiring\nthe disclosure of expenditures for specific transactions that are recorded in a registrant\u2019s books\nand records during the fiscal year, and that are attributable to severe weather events or other\nnatural conditions. This more straightforward approach will make it clearer when disclosure is\nrequired and avoid many of the questions raised by commenters in this regard.\nvi. Carbon Offsets and Renewable Energy Credits (Rule 14-02(e))\nIf carbon offsets or RECs have been used as a material component of a registrant\u2019s plan\nto achieve its disclosed climate-related targets or goals, the final rules (Rule 14-02(e)) require\nregistrants to disclose (1) the aggregate amount of carbon offsets and RECs expensed, (2) the\naggregate amount of capitalized carbon offsets and RECs recognized, and (3) the aggregate\namount of losses2098 incurred on the capitalized carbon offsets and RECs, during the fiscal\n2097 See supra notes 1881 and 1882 and accompanying text.\n2098 For example, an impairment could result in the recognition of a loss on a capitalized carbon offset.\n486\n\nyear.2099 As explained above, although the final rules do not include a requirement for\nregistrants to disclose costs and expenditures related to transition activities in the financial\nstatements as proposed,2100 we think it is appropriate to require registrants to disclose costs,\nexpenditures, and losses related to one type of transition activity\u2014the acquisition2101 and use of\ncarbon offsets and RECs\u2014because the acquisition and use of carbon offsets and RECs do not\npresent the definitional or scoping concerns raised by commenters with respect to transition\nactivities generally.2102 Significantly, requiring disclosure of capitalized costs, expenditures\nexpensed, and losses recognized in the notes to the financial statements when carbon offsets or\nRECs have been used as a material component of a registrant\u2019s plan to achieve its disclosed\nclimate-related targets or goals will complement the disclosures required by the amendments to\nRegulation S-K2103 and will anchor the disclosures required outside the financial statements to\nthose required within the financial statements, making a connection which one commenter\ngenerally described as having \u201ca focusing effect\u201d and increasing \u201cthe reliability and consistency\nof both.\u201d2104 Although we considered applying the one percent disclosure thresholds applicable\n2099 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(e)(1). The final rules do not prevent registrants from disclosing additional\ninformation about other transactions involving their carbon offsets and RECs.\n2100 See Proposing Release, section II.F.3. Proposed Rule 14-02(f), which would have required the disclosure\nof expenditures related to transition activities, provided that a registrant may be required to disclose the\namount of expense or capitalized cost, as applicable related to \u201coffset emissions (purchase of energy\ncredits),\u201d among other things. See supra note 2012.\n2101 Carbon offsets and RECs may be acquired in various ways. For example, they may be purchased or\ngranted.\n2102 See supra note 1891 and accompanying text.\n2103 See 17 CFR 229.1504(d).\n2104 See supra note 1718 and accompanying text. This commenter was referring generally to the Commission\u2019s\nproposal to amend both Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X when it stated its support for anchoring\ndisclosures required outside the financial statements to disclosures required inside the financial statements\nand was not directly addressing the requirement to disclose expenditure related to carbon offsets or RECs.\nSee id. However, this commenter\u2019s general assertion is equally applicable to the requirements in the final\nrules to disclose certain information about carbon offsets and RECs inside and outside the financial\nstatements.\n487\n\nto severe weather events and other natural conditions to carbon offsets and RECs, using the same\ntrigger for disclosure in the amendments to Regulation S-K and the amendments to Regulation S-\nX will provide investors with a comprehensive understanding of the registrant\u2019s use of carbon\noffsets and RECs, which will help investors evaluate the role of these instruments in a\nregistrant\u2019s climate-related strategy and help them assess the likely financial effects of a\ndisclosed material transition risk.2105\nIn addition, the final rules require registrants to disclose the beginning and ending\nbalances of capitalized carbon offsets and RECs on the balance sheet for the fiscal year.2106 The\nbeginning and ending balances of carbon offsets and RECs are an important data point for\ninvestors to understand as they assess a registrant\u2019s transition risks. Specifically, while the\ndisclosure of expenditures related to the acquisition and use of carbon offsets and RECs will\nprovide information about the registrant\u2019s activity throughout the fiscal period, it does not\nprovide information about the carbon offsets still available to the registrant for use in future\nperiods, which some commenters indicated is important information.2107 The requirement to\nprovide the beginning and ending balances will help provide a more complete picture of the\nfinancial impact of a registrant\u2019s use of carbon offsets and RECs as a material component of its\nplan to achieve a disclosed target or goal. While this particular data point was not part of the\n2105 See letter from J. McClellan (stating that a registrant\u2019s intent to meet its climate-related targets or goals\nthrough any purchase of offsets or RECs \u201cis directly connected to climate related financial metrics\u201d and\n\u201c[t]here is consensus that significant capital expenditures will be required to meet the most ambitious\ntargets, and investors will want to understand how a registrant is deploying capital against its target.\u201d).\n2106 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(e)(1).\n2107 See, e.g., letters from Rockefeller Asset Mgmt. (\u201cIt would be helpful to understand a company\u2019s intended\nutilization of carbon offsets and the corresponding quantification of carbon credits that may need to be\npurchased.\u201d); and Carbon Direct (\u201cAccurate and separate disclosure of\u2026 the procurement and retirement of\ncarbon offset credits to attempt to compensate for these emissions, are critical for informed investment\ndecisions.\u201d).\n488\n\nproposal, which would have required disclosure of costs and expenditures related to transition\nactivities more generally, the beginning and ending balances are currently existing information in\na registrant\u2019s balance sheet and therefore we expect the cost and burdens of disclosing this\ninformation to be minimal. The final rules also require a registrant to disclose where on the\nbalance sheet and income statement these capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, and losses\nare presented.2108 If a registrant is required to disclose capitalized costs, expenditures expensed,\nand losses related to carbon offsets and RECs, the final rules provide that a registrant must also\nstate, as part of the contextual information required, the registrant\u2019s accounting policy for carbon\noffsets and RECs.2109 We understand there is currently a diversity in practice in how registrants\naccount for carbon offsets and RECs, and therefore an explanation of the registrant\u2019s accounting\npolicy will help enhance the usefulness and comparability of this disclosure for investors.2110\nvii. Presentation of Disclosure (Rules 14-02(c) and (d))\nAs discussed above, the final rules (Rule 14-02(c) and (d)) require disclosure of the\namount of (1) capitalized costs and charges on the balance sheet, and (2) expenditures expensed\nas incurred and losses in the income statement, during the fiscal year, as a result of severe\n2108 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(e)(1).\n2109 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(e)(2). See infra section II.K.6.a.iii for further discussion of the requirement to\ndisclose contextual information.\n2110 On Dec. 15, 2021, the FASB Chair added a research project to explore accounting for regulatory credits\n(such as carbon offsets and RECs among others). Respondents provided feedback on this project indicating\nthat the lack of guidance in GAAP for accounting for regulatory credits results in a significant diversity in\npractice. In May 2022, the FASB added a project to its technical agenda on regulatory credits (such as\ncarbon offsets and RECs among others). See 2021 FASB Agenda Consultation Report, available at\nhttps://fasb.org/Page/ShowPdf?path=2021%20FASB%20Agenda%20Consultation%20Report.pdf. In\naddition, in July 2022, the IASB added a pollutant pricing mechanisms project to their reserve list as a\nresult of its Third Agenda Consultation. The project aims to develop specific requirements for pollutant\npricing mechanisms. See Third Agenda Consultation Feedback Statement, available at\nhttps://www.ifrs.org/content/dam/ifrs/project/third-agenda-consultation/thirdagenda-feedbackstatement-\njuly2022.pdf.\n489\n\nweather events and other natural conditions.2111 Under the final rules, registrants must\nseparately aggregate the (1) capitalized costs and charges on the balance sheet, and (2)\nexpenditures expensed as incurred and losses in the income statement to determine whether the\napplicable disclosure threshold is triggered and for purposes of disclosure.2112 The capitalized\ncosts, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses must be segregated between the balance sheet\nand the income statement depending on which financial statement they are recorded within upon\nrecognition in accordance with applicable GAAP. For each of the balance sheet and income\nstatement disclosures, if the applicable disclosure threshold is met, a registrant is required to\ndisclose the aggregate amount of expenditures expensed and losses and the aggregate amount of\ncapitalized costs and charges incurred during the fiscal year and separately identify where on the\nincome statement and balance sheet these amounts are presented as illustrated in greater detail\nbelow.2113\nWith respect to capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, and losses related to carbon\noffsets and RECs, registrants must disclose these amounts if carbon offsets or RECs have been\nused as a material component of a registrant\u2019s plan to achieve its disclosed climate-related targets\nor goals.2114 Unlike the disclosures related to severe weather events and other natural conditions,\na registrant is not required to separately determine whether the disclosure threshold is triggered\nfor costs, expenditures, and losses that are recorded on the balance sheet versus the income\n2111 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(c) and (d).\n2112 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(b), (c), and (d). Similarly, the proposed Expenditure Metrics would have required a\nregistrant to separately aggregate the amount of expenditures expensed and the amount of capitalized costs\nto determine whether the applicable disclosure threshold was triggered. See Proposing Release, section\nII.F.3.\n2113 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(c) and (d).\n2114 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(e)(1).\n490\n\nstatement for disclosures related to carbon offsets and RECs.2115 If disclosure is required\nbecause carbon offsets or RECs have been used as a material component of a registrant\u2019s plan to\nachieve its disclosed climate-related targets or goals, then a registrant must separately disclose\nthe following: (1) the aggregate amount of each of the capitalized costs, expenditures expensed,\nand losses related to carbon offsets and RECs during the fiscal year; (2) the beginning and\nending balances of capitalized carbon offsets and RECs on the balance sheet for the fiscal year;\nand (3) where on the balance sheet and the income statement the capitalized costs, expenditures\nexpensed, and losses related to carbon offsets and RECs are presented, as illustrated in greater\ndetail below.2116\nWe are providing the following example to help illustrate the operation of the final rules.\nAssume a registrant (1) capitalized $1,200,000 of expenditures related to Severe Weather Event\nA; (2) incurred an impairment charge of $750,000 in the income statement to write-off $750,000\nof inventory from the balance sheet related to Natural Condition B; (3) capitalized $1,000,000 of\nexpenditures to replace the inventory written off related to Natural Condition B; (4) expensed\n$2,000,000 of expenditures related to Severe Weather Event C; and (5) received $400,000 in\ninsurance recoveries related to Severe Weather Event A. The registrant determined that Severe\nWeather Events A and C and Natural Condition B were significant contributing factors in\nincurring the capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, losses, and recovery described\nabove. In addition, the registrant used carbon offsets and RECs as a material component of its\nplan to achieve a disclosed climate-related target or goal, and it capitalized $1,000,000 and\nexpensed $3,000,000 of carbon offsets or RECs during the period. The registrant had a\n2115 See id.\n2116 See id.\n491\n\nbeginning balance of capitalized carbon offsets or RECs of $2,500,000 and ended the year with\n$500,000 in capitalized carbon offsets or RECs remaining on its balance sheet. The registrant\nwould determine whether the financial statement effects as a result of severe weather events and\nother natural conditions would trigger the disclosure requirements based on the thresholds, as\nillustrated below:\nExpenditure Current Fiscal Year Severe Natural Severe Percentage\nCategory Balances Weather Condition Weather Impact\n(Stockholders\u2019 Equity Event A B Event C\nfrom Balance Sheet,\nIncome or Loss Before\nIncome Tax Expense or\nBenefit from Income\nStatement)\nBalance Sheet\n(capitalized costs $150,000,000 $1,200,000 $1,750,000 1.97%\nand charges)\nIncome Statement\n(expenditures\nexpensed as $75,000,000 $750,000 $2,000,000 3.67%\nincurred and\nlosses)\nIn the above example, the expenditures incurred toward Severe Weather Event A was\n$1,200,000 (capitalized on balance sheet), the capitalized cost, charge, and loss incurred as a\nresult of Natural Condition B was $1,750,000 (charge on balance sheet and loss in income\nstatement of $750,00 and capitalized cost of $1,000,000 on the balance sheet), and the\nexpenditures incurred toward Severe Weather Event C was $2,000,000 (expense in the income\nstatement). The aggregate amount of the absolute value of capitalized costs and charges on the\nbalance sheet ($2,950,000) exceeded the one percent threshold of stockholders\u2019 equity, and\ntherefore disclosure would be required for these costs and charges. The aggregate amount of\nexpenditures expensed as incurred and losses in the income statement ($2,750,000) exceeded the\none percent threshold of income or loss before income tax expense or benefit, and therefore\ndisclosure would be required for the expenses and loss. In addition, the registrant used carbon\n492\n\noffsets and RECs as a material component of its plan to achieve a disclosed climate-related target\nor goal, and therefore disclosure would be required for the carbon offsets and RECs. The\nregistrant\u2019s resulting disclosure of such costs and expenditures may be provided, for example, as\nillustrated in the following table (excluding disclosure of contextual information):\nNote X. Financial statement effects related to severe weather events and other natural\nconditions and carbon offsets and renewable energy credits:\nBalance Sheet Income Statement\nCategory Year Ended Dec. 31, Year Ended Dec. 31,\n20X2 20X3 20X1 20X2 20X3\nSevere Weather Events and\nOther Natural Conditions\nCapitalized Costs and Charges:\nInventory $ - $ 250,000a\nPP&E $ - $1,200,000\nExpenditures Expensed as\nIncurred and Losses:\nGeneral &\n$ - $ - $ (2,000,000)\nAdministrative\nOther Income/(Loss) $ - $ - $ (750,000)\na. $1,000,000 + ($750,000) = $250,000\nIn this example, the required contextual information may include disclosure such as the\nspecific severe weather events, natural conditions, and transactions that were aggregated for\npurposes of determining the effects on the balance sheet and income statement amounts and, if\napplicable, policy decisions made by a registrant, such as any significant judgments made to\ndetermine the amount of capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses.2117 Also,\nas part of the contextual information, a registrant would be required to disclose the $400,000 in\n2117 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(a). See infra section II.K.6.a.iii for further discussion of the requirement to disclose\ncontextual information.\n493\n\ninsurance recoveries recognized in the consolidated financial statements as a result of Severe\nWeather Event A, including identification of where it is presented in the income statement or\nbalance sheet.\nCarbon Offsets and RECs\nCarbon Offsets and RECs at Jan. 1, 20X3 $2,500,000\nCapitalized Carbon Offsets and RECs $1,000,000\nExpensed Carbon Offsets and RECs $(3,000,000)\nCarbon Offsets and RECs at Dec. 31, 20X3 $500,000\nCarbon offsets and RECs are presented in the Intangible Assets line item on the balance sheet and\nexpensed in the General and Administrative line item on the income statement.a\na. As noted above, there is diversity in practice in accounting for carbon offsets and RECs. See supra note\n2110 and accompanying text. In this example, the entity capitalizes all of its costs of carbon offsets and RECs\nand presents these amounts within the intangible assets line item. We are providing this example for\nillustrative purposes only and this is not meant to indicate a preferred method of accounting or presentation.\nRegistrants should consider their specific facts and circumstances when determining the appropriate accounting\ntreatment and disclose their accounting policy in accordance with 17 CFR 210.14-02(e)(2).\nIn this example, the required contextual information would include the registrant\u2019s\naccounting policy for the carbon offsets and RECs.2118\nCurrently, expenditures, costs, charges, losses, and recoveries may appear in different\nplaces within the financial statements (e.g., in one or more asset line items or expense line items\non the balance sheet or income statement, respectively). The final rules address this dispersed\npresentation by requiring registrants to first identify the relevant expenditures, costs, charges,\nlosses, and recoveries and then separately disclose where on the balance sheet and income\nstatement these costs and expenditures are presented.2119 Such an approach should provide\ninsight into, and context for understanding, the nature of a registrant\u2019s business, and provide\nconsistency and comparability for users of the financial statements.\n2118 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(a) and (e)(2).\n2119 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(c), (d), (e)(1), and (f).\n494\n\nSimilar to the examples of disclosure that were included in the proposed rules, the final\nrules state that a registrant may be required to disclose the aggregate amount of expenditures\nexpensed and losses as incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions,\nfor example, to restore operations, relocate assets or operations affected by the event or\ncondition, retire affected assets, repair affected assets, recognize impairment loss of affected\nassets, or otherwise respond to the effect that severe weather events and other natural conditions\nhad on business operations.2120 The final rules also state that a registrant may be required to\ndisclose the aggregate amount of capitalized costs and charges incurred as a result of severe\nweather events and other natural conditions, for example, to restore operations, retire affected\nassets, replace or repair affected assets, recognize an impairment charge for affected assets, or\notherwise respond to the effect that severe weather events and other natural conditions had on\nbusiness operations.2121\n4. Financial Estimates and Assumptions (Rule 14-02(h))\na. Proposed Rules\nThe Commission proposed to require registrants to disclose whether the estimates and\nassumptions used to produce their consolidated financial statements were impacted by exposures\nto risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, severe weather events and\n2120 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(c). In response to a question raised by a commenter, with respect to the capitalized\ncosts, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other\nnatural conditions, we are clarifying that the final rules do not require a registrant to disclose both the\ncapitalization of expenditures and subsequent expense of expenditures in the same period. See supra note\n1989. Rather, the final rules require the disclosure of expenditures expensed and losses \u201cas incurred.\u201d See\n17 CFR 210.14-02(c). For example, a registrant that purchased new machinery to replace machinery that\nwas damaged due to a severe weather event would be required to disclose the cost to purchase the new\nmachinery (assuming the relevant disclosure threshold is met), but the registrant would not be required to\ndisclose (or include in the numerator for purposes of calculating the disclosure threshold) the subsequent\ndepreciation associated with the machinery.\n2121 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(d).\n495\n\nother natural conditions or any climate-related risks identified by the registrant pursuant to Item\n1502(a) of Regulation S-K.2122 For such impacts, registrants would have been required to\nprovide a qualitative description of how these events impacted the development of the estimates\nand assumptions used in the preparation of their financial statements.2123\nLike the other proposed financial statement metrics, the proposed rules also included a\nprovision that would have required separate disclosure focused on transition activities, including\nidentified transition risks.2124 If the estimates and assumptions the registrant used to produce the\nconsolidated financial statements were impacted by risks and uncertainties associated with, or\nknown impacts from, a potential transition to a lower carbon economy or any climate-related\ntargets it disclosed, the registrant would have been required to provide a qualitative description\nof how the development of the estimates and assumptions were impacted by such a potential\ntransition or the registrant\u2019s disclosed climate-related targets.2125 If a registrant elected to\ndisclose the impact of an opportunity on its financial estimate and assumptions, then it would\nhave been required to do so consistently and would have been required to follow the same\napplicable presentation and disclosure requirements.2126\nThe Commission explained in the Proposing Release that estimates and assumptions are\ncurrently required for accounting and financial reporting purposes (e.g., projected financial\ninformation used in impairment calculations, estimated loss contingencies, estimated credit risks,\ncommodity price assumptions) and expressed its belief that the proposed disclosures could\n2122 See Proposing Release, section II.F.4.\n2123 See id.\n2124 See id.\n2125 See id.\n2126 See id.\n496\n\nprovide decision-useful information and transparency to investors about the impact of climate-\nrelated events and transition activities, including disclosed targets and goals, on such estimates\nand assumptions.2127 In addition, the Commission stated that such disclosure could allow\ninvestors to evaluate the reasonableness of the registrant\u2019s estimates and assumptions, which are\nused to prepare the registrant\u2019s financial statements.2128 The Proposing Release noted that\ncurrent accounting standards require registrants to consider how climate-related matters may\nintersect with and affect the financial statements, including their impact on estimates and\nassumptions. However, the Proposing Release explained that the nature of climate-related events\nand transition activities discussed in the proposed rules may manifest over a longer time horizon,\nand therefore targeted disclosure requirements may be necessary to elicit decision-useful\ninformation for investors in a consistent manner.2129\nIn addition, the Commission noted in the Proposing Release that some registrants have\nalready provided disclosure along the lines of the proposed requirements, which the Commission\nsaid provided support for the feasibility of making such disclosures.2130 The Proposing Release\nprovided examples of financial statement estimates and assumptions that may require disclosure\npursuant to the proposed rules, such as those related to the estimated salvage value of certain\nassets, estimated useful life of certain assets, projected financial information used in impairment\ncalculations, estimated loss contingencies, estimated reserves (such as environmental reserves or\n2127 See id.\n2128 See id.\n2129 See id.\n2130 See id.\n497\n\nloan loss allowances), estimated credit risks, fair value measurement of certain assets, and\ncommodity price assumptions.2131\nb. Comments\nA number of commenters stated that they supported the proposal to require the disclosure\nof whether and how the estimates and assumptions the registrant used to produce the\nconsolidated financial statements were impacted by exposures to risks and uncertainties\nassociated with, or known impacts from, severe weather events and other natural conditions and\na potential transition to a lower carbon economy, or any climate-related targets disclosed by the\nregistrant.2132 Several commenters stated that the proposed rules would provide useful\ninformation for investors.2133 For example, one commenter asserted that disclosures of\nregistrants\u2019 estimates and assumptions are \u201c[e]qually if not more important\u201d than the line item\ndisclosures themselves.2134 Another commenter stated that requiring the disclosure of impacts\non estimates and assumptions is necessary because for financial risk to be assessed and\nquantified using financial metrics, investors need to understand the degree of uncertainty of\nprojections and be able to use that information to alter investment choices.2135 One commenter\nstated that it would use disclosures about impacts on estimates and assumptions to uncover\nemerging trends affecting the registrant or other companies similarly situated with respect to the\nclimate related event.2136\n2131 See id.\n2132 See, e.g., letters from As You Sow; Bailard; BC IM Corp.; Boston Trust; CalPERS; Calvert; Center Amer.\nProgress; D.

Rowe Price. Similarly, one commenter suggested that the\ndisclosure of financial estimates and assumptions impacted by climate-related opportunities should only be\nrequired where the opportunities are highly likely to occur or a core element of the registrant\u2019s strategy, but\nif the opportunity is otherwise uncertain, it should not be factored into the estimates or assumptions. See\nletter from Sarasin.\n2142 See, e.g., letters from SIFMA AMG; and T. Rowe Price.\n499\n\nshould not be limited to only significant or material estimates and assumptions because it would\ncreate a risk that registrants would fail to produce decision-useful information for investors.2143\nA few commenters stated that they did not support the proposed disclosures of estimates\nand assumptions.2144 For example, some commenters pointed out that existing accounting\nstandards already require the disclosure of material financial estimates and related assumptions,\nwhich would include those impacted by climate-related risks.2145 Another commenter stated that\namending Regulation S-X to require these disclosures when, in its view, existing standards\nalready require this disclosure could lead registrants to include a statement in their reports that\nclimate-related events were not considered (if they were not a key assumption in calculating\nestimates), which could imply a negative connotation that, in fact, they should have been\nconsidered.2146\nSome commenters stated that it would be challenging to provide the disclosures,2147 or\nstated that additional guidance was needed.2148 For example, one commenter stated that without\nadditional guidance it would be challenging for registrants to develop estimates to isolate the\nrelevant exposures.2149 Another commenter stated that it would be helpful to provide additional\nguidance about when the disclosures would be triggered when there may be more than one\n2143 See letter from Amer. for Fin.

Critical accounting estimates are those estimates\nmade in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of\nestimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial\ncondition or results of operations of the registrant.

Reform, Sunrise Project et al.\n501\n\nThe Commission included a request for comment in the Proposing Release asking if, for\nthe proposed financial statement metrics, it should require a registrant to disclose material\nchanges in estimates, assumptions, or methodology among fiscal years and the reasons for those\nchanges, and if so, whether the Commission should require the material changes disclosure to\noccur on a quarterly, or some other, basis.2157 Some commenters stated that registrants should be\nrequired to disclose material changes in estimates and assumptions for the proposed financial\nstatement metrics.2158 A few of these commenters noted that current regulations already require\ndisclosure of material changes in estimates and assumptions.2159 However, some commenters\nasserted that current regulations may not be effectively eliciting this disclosure.2160 One\ncommenter suggested that the Commission should require material changes in estimates and\nassumptions to be provided on a quantitative basis by financial statement caption because the\ninformation would be useful in showing the variability of key estimates and assumptions going\nforward and their future impact on cash flows.2161 With respect to timing, one commenter\nsuggested that disclosures regarding material changes in estimates and assumptions could be\nmade on an annual basis with prior year changes and adjustments noted.2162 Conversely, one\ncommenter stated that registrants should not be required to disclose material changes in estimates\nand assumptions.2163 In addition, one commenter asked the Commission to clarify that nothing\n2157 See Proposing Release, section II.F.4.\n2158 See, e.g., letters from ERM CVS; Carbon Tracker; Center Amer.

Progress.\n2161 See letter from CFA Institute.\n2162 See letter from Carbon Tracker.\n2163 See letter from TotalEnergies.\n502\n\nin the proposed rules would create an affirmative obligation for a foreign private issuer to\nprovide interim updates for any material changes beyond what they would already be required to\ndisclose on Form 6-K.2164\nc. Final Rules\nWe are adopting the proposed requirements (Rule 14-02(h)) for registrants to disclose\nimpacts on financial estimates and assumptions with some modifications.2165 First, the\nCommission proposed to require a registrant to disclose whether the estimates and assumptions\nthe registrant used to produce the consolidated financial statements were impacted by risks and\nuncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, a potential transition to a lower carbon\neconomy or any climate related targets disclosed by the registrant.2166 The final rules, instead of\nrequiring disclosures related to \u201ca potential transition to a lower carbon economy,\u201d require\nregistrants to disclose financial estimates and assumptions related to a narrower category of\ntransition activities, specifically, \u201cany . . . transition plans disclosed by the registrant.\u201d2167 As\nnoted above, commenters, including registrants, raised concerns about the scope of transition\nactivities and potential difficulties with identifying and quantifying their impacts when they\noverlapped with a registrant\u2019s ordinary business decisions.2168 To reduce the potential burden on\nregistrants, we have decided to narrow the scope of transition activities covered by this aspect of\nthe final rule to only those transition plans disclosed by the registrant.2169 Consistent with the\n2164 See letter from BHP.\n2165 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(h).\n2166 See Proposing Release, section II.F.4.\n2167 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(h).\n2168 See supra note 1892 and accompanying text.\n2169 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(h).\n503\n\nproposed rules, the final rules also require a registrant to disclose whether the estimates and\nassumptions the registrant used to produce the consolidated financial statements were impacted\nby risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, any climate-related targets\ndisclosed by the registrant.2170\nSecond, consistent with commenters\u2019 suggestion,2171 we are modifying the proposed\nrequirements by adding a materiality qualifier in the final rules. The final rules require\nregistrants to disclose whether the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the consolidated\nfinancial statements were materially impacted by exposures to risks and uncertainties associated\nwith, or known impacts from, severe weather events and other natural conditions, such as\nhurricanes, tornadoes,2172 flooding, drought, wildfires, extreme temperatures, and sea level rise,\nor any climate-related targets or transition plans disclosed by the registrant.2173 If so, then\nconsistent with the proposed rules, the final rules require registrants to provide a qualitative\ndescription of how the development of such estimates and assumptions were impacted by the\nevents, conditions, and disclosed targets or transition plans identified above.2174\n2170 See id.\n2171 See supra notes 2138-2141 and accompanying text.\n2172 We have added hurricanes and tornadoes to the list of severe weather events and other natural conditions\nincluded in Rule 14-02(h) to be consistent with the addition of these two types of severe weather events or\nnatural conditions in Rule 14-02(c) and (d). See supra section II.K.3.c.v.\n2173 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(h). As previously discussed, the final rules include similar requirements under\nsubpart 1500 of Regulation S-K to disclose material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions as a\ndirect result of disclosed actions under a transition plan or as a direct result of a disclosed target or goal or\nactions taken to make progress toward meeting the target or goal. See 17 CFR 229.1502(e), discussed\nsupra section II.D.2, and 17 CFR 229.1504(c)(2), discussed supra section II.G.3. When responding to\nthese Regulation S-K provisions, a registrant may cross-reference from the disclosure provided under 17\nCFR 210.14-02(h) to the extent such disclosure is responsive to these subpart 1500 provisions.\n2174 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(h). For the avoidance of doubt, if the registrant\u2019s estimates and assumptions were\nnot materially impacted by exposures to risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from,\nsevere weather events and other natural conditions, or any climate-related targets or transition plans\ndisclosed by the registrant, then no disclosure is required under Rule 14-02(h).\n504\n\nAs described above, a number of commenters indicated that if we adopted a requirement\nto disclose impacts on estimates and assumptions, then it would be appropriate to include a\nmateriality qualifier in the final rules, and those commenters recommended various permutations\nrelated to the materiality qualifier.2175 After considering this feedback, we have modified the\nfinal rules to focus on estimates and assumptions that have been materially impacted because a\nregistrant may use numerous inputs and assumptions, including qualitative considerations, when\ndeveloping accounting estimates. Focusing on estimates and assumptions that were materially\nimpacted by the events, conditions, and disclosed targets and plans will help to reduce\noperational challenges and burdens that could arise if registrants were required to assess all\nimpacts when determining the disclosures that would be required. We considered whether it\nwould be appropriate to instead include two materiality qualifiers and require the disclosure of\nmaterial estimates and assumptions that were materially impacted. However, we think that\nadding a second materiality qualifier is unnecessary because the disclosures that would result\nfrom the two different alternatives would likely be the same. Namely, we think it is unlikely that\nthere could be \u201cmaterial\u201d impact to an estimate or assumption if the estimate or assumption itself\nwas not material to the financial statements.2176 We also considered whether to require\ndisclosure of any impacts to material estimates and assumptions or to not include any materiality\nqualifiers in the final rules, but we think the approach we are taking appropriately balances\ninvestors\u2019 need for decision-useful information with a desire to reduce operational challenges for\nregistrants.\n2175 See supra notes 2138-2141 and accompanying text.\n2176 See supra note 381 and accompanying text.\n505\n\nWe continue to believe that disclosure of whether and how climate-related events\nimpacted the development of financial estimates and assumptions will provide important\ninformation to investors. As the Commission stated in the Proposing Release, such disclosure\nwill provide insight into the impacts described above on the registrant\u2019s financial statements and\nwill allow investors to assess the reasonableness of the registrant\u2019s estimates and\nassumptions.2177 Among other things, these disclosures will allow investors to evaluate material\nimpacts on future cash flows, which will help investors make more informed investing decisions.\nWe also agree with those commenters that stated disclosure of impacts on financial estimates and\nassumptions would enable investors to evaluate a registrant\u2019s \u201cphysical risk resilience,\u201d2178 or\nwould inform investors \u201cof the scope, likelihood, and magnitude of potential risks as perceived\nby the company\u201d and enable \u201ccomparative analysis against peers.\u201d2179\nSome commenters stated that they did not support the proposed requirement to disclose\nfinancial estimates and assumptions because existing accounting standards already require the\ndisclosure of this information and therefore this additional requirement would be unnecessary or\ncould be confusing for investors.2180 Although we agree with commenters that U.S. GAAP and\nIFRS require the disclosure of material estimates and assumptions in many circumstances,2181\nincluding significant inputs associated with material estimates and assumptions, the final rules\nwill enhance transparency and consistency by requiring registrants to disclose how estimates and\nassumptions are materially impacted by severe weather events, natural conditions, and disclosed\n2177 See Proposing Release, section II.F.4.\n2178 See letter from Morningstar.\n2179 See letter from BMO Global.\n2180 See supra notes 2145 and 2146 and accompanying text.\n2181 See supra note 2145.\n506\n\ntargets and transition plans, which may require more specific disclosures in certain situations\nthan is currently required under applicable accounting standards.\nIn addition, although we agree with commenters that the proposed requirements share\nsimilarities with critical accounting estimates,2182 we do not think those disclosures obviate the\nneed for this requirement because the final rules go further by requiring specific disclosure about\nhow estimates and assumptions are materially impacted by risks and uncertainties associated\nwith, or known impacts from, severe weather events and other natural conditions and any\nclimate-related targets or transition plans disclosed by the registrant. While critical accounting\nestimates are often presented outside of the financial statements, the disclosure regarding\nmaterial impacts to estimates and assumptions will be located in a single note to the financial\nstatements along with the other financial statement disclosures we are adopting, which will\nenhance the usefulness of the disclosure to investors. Furthermore, we do not think the required\ndisclosure will be confusing to investors. To the contrary, it will provide investors with more\ndecision-useful information about the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the financial\nstatements than is required under applicable accounting standards. Registrants are presumably\nmaking business decisions and taking actions to achieve their disclosed transition plans and\ntargets and these decisions may have material impacts on their estimates and assumptions.\nProviding investors with an understanding of these impacts will help them better evaluate a\nregistrant\u2019s financial position, performance, and future cash flows. Other commenters raised\nconcerns about registrants\u2019 abilities to isolate the relevant impacts when there may be more than\none contributing factor.2183 We expect these concerns to be mitigated to some extent by the final\n2182 See supra notes 2153 and 2154 and accompanying text.\n2183 See supra note 2150 and accompanying text.\n507\n\nrules, which include a materiality qualifier and thereby focus management on a narrower\ncategory of impacts for which management should have greater insight. In addition, the final\nrules require registrants to provide a qualitative description of the impacts, which generally is\nless burdensome to produce than if management had to identify a specific amount.\nIn addition, we are reiterating a few examples that were included in the Proposing\nRelease where severe weather events, natural conditions, or a registrant\u2019s disclosed targets or\ntransition plans could affect a registrant\u2019s financial estimates and assumptions.2184 For example,\na registrant\u2019s climate-related targets and related commitments, such as a disclosed commitment\nto achieve net-zero emissions by 2040, may impact certain accounting estimates and\nassumptions. Also, for example, if a registrant disclosed a commitment that would require\ndecommissioning an asset by a target year, then the registrant\u2019s useful life and salvage value\nestimates used to compute depreciation expense as well as its measurement of asset retirement\nobligation should reflect alignment with that commitment. Financial statement estimates and\nassumptions that may require disclosure pursuant to the final rules may include those related to\nthe estimated salvage value of certain assets, estimated useful life of certain assets, projected\nfinancial information used in impairment calculations, estimated loss contingencies, estimated\nreserves (such as environmental reserves, asset retirement obligations, or loan loss allowances),\nestimated credit risks, fair value measurement of certain assets, and commodity price\nassumptions.\nFinally, although we considered whether it would be appropriate to require disclosure of\nmaterial changes in estimates, assumptions, or methodology among fiscal years and the reasons\n2184 See Proposing Release, section II.F.4.\n508\n\nfor those changes,2185 at this time we are not including such a requirement in the final rules. The\nnarrower scope of the final rules, which is focused on discrete transactions that are currently\nrecognized in a registrant\u2019s financial statements in accordance with GAAP, reduces the need for\nexplicit requirements regarding material changes in estimates and assumptions underlying the\nfinancial disclosures. Current requirements under GAAP would continue to apply to material\nchanges in estimates and assumptions.2186 In addition, in response to the commenter that asked\nfor clarification about whether foreign private issuers would have to provide interim updates,2187\nwe are clarifying that the final rules will not affect existing filing obligations under Form 6-K.\n5. Opportunities\na. Proposed Rules\nThe proposed rules would have permitted a registrant, at its option, to disclose the impact\nof any opportunities arising from severe weather events and other natural conditions, any impact\nof efforts to pursue climate-related opportunities associated with transition activities, and the\nimpact of any other climate-related opportunities, including those identified by the registrant\npursuant to proposed Item 1502(a) of Regulation S-K, on any of the financial statement\nmetrics.2188 The Proposing Release explained that if a registrant makes a policy decision to\ndisclose the impact of a climate-related opportunity on the proposed financial statement metrics,\nit must do so consistently (e.g., for each fiscal year presented in the consolidated financial\nstatements, for each financial statement line item, for all relevant opportunities identified by the\n2185 See supra note 2157 and accompanying text.\n2186 See FASB ASC Topic 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections and IFRS IAS 8 Accounting\nPolicies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors.\n2187 See supra note 2164 and accompanying text.\n2188 See Proposing Release, sections II.F.2, 3, and 4.\n509\n\nregistrant) and must follow the same presentation and disclosure threshold requirements\napplicable to the required disclosures related to the financial impact metrics and expenditure\nmetrics.2189\nb. Comments\nA number of commenters stated that they supported the proposal to make the disclosure\nof climate-related opportunities optional.2190 Commenters stated that investors would benefit\nfrom this information about positive impacts,2191 including because it is key for investors to\nunderstand how a company is reducing its climate-related financial risks.2192 However, a few of\nthese commenters explained that concerns about requiring the sharing of sensitive or competitive\nbusiness information weighed in favor of making the proposed disclosure optional.2193 In\naddition, some commenters stated that they supported the proposal to require the disclosure of\nopportunities to be made consistently.2194\nOne commenter asserted that the disclosure of opportunities in the financial statements\nshould be limited to amounts that can be objectively verified and reliably quantified.2195\nSimilarly, another commenter stated it should be limited to \u201cvirtually certain opportunities\u201d to\navoid misleading investors.2196 A few commenters expressed concerns about potential\n2189 See Proposing Release, section II.F.2.\n2190 See, e.g., letters from Anthesis; BC IM Corp.; Bloomberg; C2ES; Eni Spa; ERM CVS; ICGN;\nMiller/Howard; Moody\u2019s; NY City Comptroller; Reinsurance AA; Sarasin; TotalEnergies; and T. Peterson.\n2191 See, e.g., letters from Anthesis; C2ES; and Mazars.\n2192 See letter from C2ES.\n2193 See, e.g., letters from Anthesis; C2ES; and Reinsurance AA.\n2194 See, e.g., letters from ICGN; RSM US LLP; and Sarasin.\n2195 See letter from PwC.\n2196 See letter from CEMEX.\n510\n\ngreenwashing related to the disclosure of opportunities.2197 However, one commenter explained\nthat, although there is a risk that the disclosure of opportunities could lead to greenwashing, by\nincluding the information in a filing with the Commission, registrants would be subject to\nliability and would be required to disclose their assumptions and methodologies.2198\nOther commenters stated that the disclosure of opportunities should not be permitted in\nthe audited financial statements.2199 For example, one commenter explained that opportunities\nshould not be disclosed in the financial statements because opportunities appear to be forward-\nlooking and speculative and may be subject to management bias.2200 Some commenters stated\nthat it may be difficult to develop internal controls for the disclosure of opportunities2201 or that\nopportunities may be complex to audit.2202 A few commenters suggested that registrants could\naddress opportunities in the MD&A section of their periodic reports.2203\nSome commenters stated that they would support the Commission mandating the\ndisclosure of opportunities.2204 One of these commenters stated that mandated disclosure of\nopportunities would facilitate an understanding of the strategic or competitive advantages a\ncompany may have in terms of furthering physical risk resilience.2205 Another commenter\nexpressed support for mandatory disclosure of climate-related opportunities except when such\n2197 See, e.g., letters from Bloomberg; D. Higgins; R. Bentley; and R. Burke.\n2198 See letter from Anthesis.\n2199 See, e.g., letters from McCormick; and Nutrien.\n2200 See letter from Nutrien.\n2201 See, e.g., letters from CEMEX; and Nutrien.\n2202 See, e.g., letters from CEMEX; and RSM US LLP.\n2203 See, e.g., letters from Eni Spa; Mazars (recommending that opportunities would be discussed in the\nfinancial statements and in MD&A); and RSM US LLP.\n2204 See, e.g., letters from BHP; Morningstar; and We Mean Business.\n2205 See letter from Morningstar.\n511\n\nopportunities are unrelated to the registrant\u2019s core or existing lines of business.2206 Relatedly,\none commenter requested that the Commission clarify that the disclosure of opportunities is\noptional because the interaction between proposed rules 14-02(b) and (j) could give the\nimpression that disclosure of opportunities is required if the impact is greater than one\npercent.2207\nA few commenters recommended revisions or clarifications to the definition of\nopportunities. For example, one commenter pointed out that financial statements typically\ninclude backward-looking financial results and therefore the use of the term opportunities in the\nfinancial statements should be clarified.2208 Another commenter asserted that the definition of\n\u201cclimate-related opportunities\u201d provided in proposed Item 1500(b) is confusing when applied to\nthe disclosure of opportunities in the financial statements, which would be made on a line item\nbasis, because the definition refers to the actual or potential positive impacts of climate-related\nconditions and events on a registrant\u2019s consolidated financial statements \u201cas a whole.\u201d2209 Other\ncommenters suggested that the definition of climate-related opportunities should be revised to\ninclude activities in the forestry and forest products sector2210 and the positive impacts of a\ncompany\u2019s competitive positioning, brand strength, and reputation.2211 One commenter asserted\nthat the disclosure of opportunities should not impact the reporting relevant for the disclosure\nthresholds because it could potentially discourage companies from disclosing impacts from\n2206 See letter from We Mean Business.\n2207 See letter from Deloitte & Touche.\n2208 See letter from CFA Institute.\n2209 See letter from Chamber.\n2210 See letter from NAFO.\n2211 See letter from Moody\u2019s.\n512\n\nopportunities and triggering the threshold.2212 One commenter requested that the Commission\nprovide additional guidance around the definition of climate-related opportunities.2213\nc. Final Rules\nIn light of the changes to other aspects of the final rules, we have decided not to adopt the\nproposed rules related to the disclosure of opportunities. First, as discussed above, we have\ndecided not to adopt: (1) the proposed Financial Impact Metrics,2214 (2) the proposed\nrequirement to disclose costs and expenditures related to general transition activities in the\nfinancial statements (e.g., a portion of the proposed Expenditure Metrics), and (3) the proposed\nrequirement to disclose the impacts of any climate-related risks identified pursuant to proposed\nItem 1502(a) of Regulation S-K. The proposed rules would have permitted a registrant to\ndisclose the impact of any opportunities with respect to each of these disclosure items.2215\nBecause these disclosure items will not be included in the final rules, there is no reason to adopt\nfinal requirements regarding the disclosure of opportunities with respect to these items.\nSecond, as discussed above in section K.3.c, in a modification from the proposed rules,\nthe final rules require the disclosure of capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and\nlosses incurred as a result of severe weather events.2216 Unlike the proposed rules, the final rules\ndo not make a distinction between \u201crisks\u201d and \u201copportunities\u201d in the financial statement\ndisclosure requirements. Therefore, we do not think it is necessary to retain a provision related\n2212 See letter from Morningstar.\n2213 See letter from PwC.\n2214 See supra note 1735 for an explanation regarding the overlap between the proposed Financial Impact\nMetrics and the proposed Expenditure Metrics.\n2215 See Proposing Release, sections II.F.2, 3, and 4.\n2216 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(c) and (d). The proposed rules would have required the disclosure of costs and\nexpenditures to \u201cmitigate the risks from severe weather events and other natural conditions.\u201d See\nProposing Release, section II.F.3.\n513\n\nto the disclosure of opportunities. To the extent that a registrant incurs costs and expenditures as\na result of a severe weather event (applying the final rules\u2019 attribution principle), the registrant\nwould be required to disclose these costs and expenditures under the final rules regardless of the\nreason for the expenditure (assuming the disclosure threshold is met). However, we do not\nexpect that registrants will commonly incur costs, expenditures, charges, and losses as a result of\nsevere weather events or other natural conditions in furtherance of an opportunity. In this regard,\nour expectation is consistent with the Proposing Release, which did not provide any examples of\nopportunities associated with severe weather events and other natural conditions in the\ndiscussion of the proposed Expenditure Metrics.2217 To the extent that a registrant identifies a\ncost or expenditure incurred as a result of severe weather events or other natural conditions that it\nbelieves was incurred in furtherance of an opportunity, disclosure of the cost or expenditure\nwould be required (assuming the other requirements of the final rules are satisfied) as explained\nabove. However, the registrant would not be required to identify any costs or expenditures\ndisclosed under Article 14 as related to an \u201copportunity\u201d as explained in greater detail below.2218\nThe same analysis applies to opportunities related to carbon offsets and RECs. The\nrequirement in the final rules to disclose capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, and losses\nrelated to carbon offsets and RECs was not included in the proposed rules because the proposed\n2217 See Proposing Release, section II.F.3 (stating, in the discussion of the proposed Expenditure Metrics, that a\nregistrant may choose to disclose the impact of efforts to pursue climate-related opportunities associated\nwith transition activities but remaining silent with respect to opportunities for costs and expenditures\nrelated to severe weather events and other natural conditions).\n2218 The same analysis applies to opportunities related to carbon offsets and RECs. The requirement in the final\nrules to disclose capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, and losses related to carbon offsets and RECs\nwas not included in the proposed rules because the proposed rules required the disclosure of costs and\nexpenditures related to transition risks more generally, and therefore the proposed rules did not separately\naddress opportunities related to carbon offsets and RECs. Under the final rules, a registrant is required to\ndisclose capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, and losses related to carbon offsets and RECs regardless\nof the reason for the expenditure (assuming the disclosure threshold is met) for the same reasons as\ndiscussed in this paragraph with respect to severe weather events. See 17 CFR 210.14-02(e).\n514\n\nrules required the disclosure of costs and expenditures related to transition risks more generally,\nand therefore the proposed rules did not separately address opportunities related to carbon offsets\nand RECs. Under the final rules, a registrant is required to disclose capitalized costs,\nexpenditures expensed, and losses related to carbon offsets and RECs regardless of the reason for\nthe expenditure (assuming the disclosure threshold is met) for the same reasons as discussed in\nthe previous paragraph with respect to severe weather events. We expect that registrants will\nmost commonly incur costs, expenditures, and losses in connection with the acquisition and use\nof carbon offsets and RECs as part of a strategy to mitigate transition risk as opposed to in\nfurtherance of an opportunity. However, to the extent that a registrant incurs such costs,\nexpenditures, and losses in furtherance of an opportunity, the registrant would not be required to\nidentify any amounts disclosed under the final rules as related to an \u201copportunity\u201d as explained\nin greater detail below.\nThird, as discussed above in section K.4, we are adopting Rule 14-02(h), which we have\nmodified from the proposal, to require registrants to disclose whether the estimates and\nassumptions the registrant used to produce the consolidated financial statements were materially\nimpacted by exposures to risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, severe\nweather events and other natural conditions or any climate-related targets or transition plans\ndisclosed by the registrant.2219 After further consideration, we believe that including a provision\nregarding the disclosure of the impact of opportunities on the financial estimates and\nassumptions is also unnecessary. That is because Rule 14-02(h) requires a registrant to disclose\nthe \u201cknown impacts\u201d on its financial estimates and assumptions and \u201cimpacts\u201d is not limited to\n2219 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(h).\n515\n\nnegative impacts.2220 Nor does \u201cknown impacts\u201d draw a distinction between the impacts\nresulting from \u201crisks\u201d or \u201copportunities.\u201d In other words, to the extent that a registrant\u2019s\nfinancial estimates and assumptions are materially impacted by severe weather events or other\nnatural conditions or disclosed targets or transition plans, the registrant would be required to\ndisclose this material impact under the final rules regardless of the reason for the impact.2221\nTherefore, we are not adopting the proposed rules related to the voluntary disclosure in the\nfinancial statements of the impact of any opportunities related to financial estimates and\nassumptions.\nThe approach we are taking in the final rules will mitigate many of the concerns that\ncommenters raised about the disclosure of opportunities, while still providing investors with\ndecision-useful information about a registrant\u2019s capitalized costs, expenditures expensed,\ncharges, losses, and material impacts to estimates and assumptions. As discussed above, the\nfinal rules do not distinguish between \u201crisks\u201d and \u201copportunities\u201d in requiring the disclosure of\ncapitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, losses, and material impacts to estimates and\nassumptions, and registrants will not be required to identify any amounts disclosed under the\nfinal rules as related to a \u201crisk\u201d or \u201copportunity.\u201d Furthermore, any capitalized costs,\nexpenditures expensed, charges, losses, and material impacts to financial estimates and\nassumptions required to be disclosed under the final rules are limited to those that a registrant has\nactually incurred and recorded in its books and records. These aspects of the final rules should\nalleviate commenters\u2019 concerns about the potential for greenwashing,2222 issues regarding\n2220 See id.\n2221 See id.\n2222 See supra note 2197 and accompanying text.\n516\n\nauditability,2223 and concerns that registrants could be required to disclose sensitive or\ncompetitive business information related to opportunities.2224 Similarly, commenters\u2019 concerns\nabout the definition of \u201copportunities\u201d as applied to the financial statement disclosures2225 are\nrendered moot because, as explained above, the final rules will not require registrants to identify\nparticular capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, losses, or material impacts to\nestimates and assumptions as derived from an opportunity, and furthermore the final rules no\nlonger include a definition of opportunities.2226\n6. Financial Statement Disclosure Requirements\na. Contextual Information (Rule 14-02(a)) and Basis of Calculation (Rule 14-\n01(c))\ni. Proposed Rules\nIn the Proposing Release, the Commission explained that because the proposed financial\nstatement metrics would involve estimation uncertainties driven by the application of judgments\nand assumptions, similar to other financial statement disclosures, registrants would be required to\ndisclose contextual information to enable a reader to understand how it derived the financial\nstatement metrics, including a description of significant inputs and assumptions used, and if\napplicable, policy decisions made by the registrant to calculate the metrics.2227\n2223 See supra note 2202 and accompanying text.\n2224 See supra note 2193 and accompanying text.\n2225 See supra note 2208 and accompanying text.\n2226 See supra section II.C.1.c.\n2227 See Proposing Release, section II.F.1. In the Proposing Release, the Commission explained that inputs and\nassumptions may include the estimation methodology used to disaggregate the amount of impact on the\nfinancial statements between the climate-related events and activities and other factors. The Proposing\nRelease also stated that policy decisions may include a registrant\u2019s election to disclose the impacts from\nclimate-related opportunities. See Proposing Release, section II.F.1.\n517\n\nTo avoid potential confusion, maintain consistency with the rest of the financial\nstatements, and to aid comparability, the Commission proposed that registrants would be\nrequired to calculate the financial statement metrics using financial information that is consistent\nwith the scope of the rest of the registrant\u2019s consolidated financial statements included in the\nfiling.2228 Therefore, registrants would have to include in any such calculation financial\ninformation from subsidiaries.2229\nThe Commission also proposed basis of calculation requirements providing that a\nregistrant would be required to apply the same set of accounting principles that it is required to\napply in preparation of the rest of its consolidated financial statements included in the filing,\nwhenever applicable.2230\nii. Comments\nMany of the commenters that specifically addressed the proposed requirement to provide\ncontextual information supported it.2231 Commenters who supported the proposal generally\nstated that contextual information would provide important information to investors and would\nhelp them understand the financial statement disclosures.2232 One commenter stated that the\n2228 See id.\n2229 See id. (citing 17 CFR 210.3-01(a) (\u201cThere shall be filed, for the registrant and its subsidiaries\nconsolidated, audited balance sheets as of the end of each of the two most recent fiscal years.\u201d)).\n2230 See id. 17 CFR 210.4-01(a)(1) states that financial statements filed with the Commission that are not\nprepared in accordance with GAAP will be presumed misleading or inaccurate unless the Commission has\notherwise provided. The Commission stated in the Proposing Release that, for the avoidance of doubt, it\nwas clarifying the application of this concept to the proposed rules by requiring a registrant to apply the\nsame set of accounting principles that it is required to apply in the preparation of the rest of its consolidated\nfinancial statements included in the filing, whenever applicable. See Proposing Release, section II.F.1\n(citing 17 CFR 210.4-01(a)(2) (discussing the application of U.S. GAAP, IFRS, and the use of other\ncomprehensive sets of accounting principles (with reconciliation to U.S. GAAP))).\n2231 See, e.g., letters from CalPERS; CEMEX; CFA Institute; E. Ocampo; ICGN; KPMG; Mazars; Morningstar;\nPwC; Sarasin; SKY Harbor; and TotalEnergies.\n2232 See, e.g., letters from Mazars; PwC; and SKY Harbor.\n518\n\nrequirement to provide contextual information would make comparisons easier across\nregistrants.2233 Another commenter confirmed that it would use contextual information in\nevaluating a registrant\u2019s securities.2234\nA few commenters specifically disagreed with the proposal to require contextual\ninformation.2235 One commenter expressed concern that a registrant would be required to make\nmany assumptions and policy decisions in order to disclose contextual information and asserted\nthat the proposed requirement could result in inconsistent and incomparable information that is\nnot useful for investors.2236 Another commenter stated that the Proposing Release does not\nprovide any guidance on the necessary level of detail required for contextual information and\nthat contextual information will not help registrants distinguish between climate and non-climate\nrelated activities or help registrants determine how to allocate impacts to particular line items.2237\nOne commenter stated that while it supported the need for transparency in definitions and\nmethodologies used, it believed it would be possible to simplify the requirement to provide\ncontextual information, in particular, by making the information required in the audited financial\nstatements less prescriptive.2238 Finally, in the Proposing Release, the Commission requested\ncomment on whether providing additional examples or guidance would assist registrants in\ndisclosing contextual information. Commenters had different views on whether additional\n2233 See letter from Amer. For Fin. Reform, Evergreen Action, et al.\n2234 See letter from SKY Harbor.\n2235 See, e.g., letters Corteva; and Energy Transfer.\n2236 See letter from Energy Transfer.\n2237 See letter from Chamber.\n2238 See letter from BNP Paribas.\n519\n\nexamples or guidance would be helpful, but generally did not provide the Commission with any\nspecific recommendations.2239\nCommenters who addressed the issue generally agreed with the proposal to require\nregistrants to calculate the financial statement metrics using financial information that is\nconsistent with the scope of the rest of the registrant\u2019s consolidated financial statements and to\nuse the same accounting principles that the registrant is required to apply in preparing the rest of\nits consolidated financial statements including in the filing.2240 One commenter stated that\napplying the same set of accounting principles consistently throughout a registrant\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial statements is important and would aid comparability.2241 Another commenter asked the\nCommission to clarify the phrase \u201cwhenever applicable\u201d as used in proposed Rule 14-01(c)(2),\nwhich directs a registrant to, \u201cwhenever applicable, apply the same accounting principles that it is\nrequired to apply in the preparation of the rest of its consolidated financial statements . . . .\u201d2242\nThis commenter stated that the phrase \u201cwhenever applicable\u201d is confusing because it is presumed\nthat GAAP applies to the proposed financial statement metrics and therefore the Commission\nshould clarify any circumstances it is aware of where the accounting principles would conflict\nwith, or be inconsistent with, GAAP.2243 With respect to the proposed requirement to use\nfinancial information that is consistent with the scope of the rest of the registrant\u2019s consolidated\n2239 See, e.g., letters from CFA Institute; E. Ocampo; Grant Thornton; and Third Coast.\n2240 See, e.g., letters from BHP; CEMEX; CFA; Eur. Banking Fed.; Eni Spa; IAA; KPMG; Mazars;\nMorningstar; Nutrien; and Sarasin.\n2241 See letter from IAA.\n2242 See letter from Deloitte & Touche.\n2243 See id.\n520\n\nfinancial statements, one commenter stated that the proposed rule \u201cmakes no allowance for\nwholly-owned subsidiaries, which may lead to duplication and double counting.\u201d2244\nIn addition, most commenters supported requiring the application of existing GAAP to\nthe proposed financial statement metrics.2245 However, a number of commenters raised concerns\nthat certain of the proposed financial statement metrics would not necessarily comport with\nGAAP, including amounts for lost revenues, cost savings, or cost reductions.2246 In addition, in\nresponse to a question in the Proposing Release, certain commenters stated that the proposed\nfinancial statement metrics should be calculated at a reportable segment level when a registrant\nhas more than one reportable segment, as defined by FASB ASC Topic 280 Segment Reporting,\nor presented by geographic areas that are consistent with the registrant\u2019s reporting pursuant to\nFASB ASC Topic 280-10-50-41.2247 On the other hand, some commenters stated that they did\nnot support calculating and presenting the disclosures at a segment or geographic level because it\nwould be too complex or would result in the disclosure of irrelevant information.2248\niii. Final Rules\nAfter consideration of the comments, we are adopting the requirement (Rule 14-02(a)) to\nprovide contextual information with certain clarifying modifications. We have decided to\ninclude in the text of the final rules two additional types of contextual information a registrant is\nrequired to disclose.2249 In addition to the types of contextual information included in the\n2244 See letter from PPL.\n2245 See, e.g., letters from Chamber; Eni Spa; KPMG; and Mazars.\n2246 See letter from Chamber. See also, e.g., letters from KPMG; PwC; SIFMA; and Soc. Corp. Gov.\n2247 See, e.g., letters from Eni Spa; ICGN; Mazars; Moody\u2019s; Morningstar; and Sarasin.\n2248 See, e.g., letters from Abrasca; BHP; and SEC Professionals.\n2249 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(a).\n521\n\nproposed rules, registrants will also be required to disclose significant judgments made and other\ninformation that is important to an investor\u2019s understanding of the financial statement effect.2250\nTherefore, under the final rules, a registrant must \u201c[p]rovide contextual information, describing\nhow each specified financial statement effect . . . was derived, including a description of\nsignificant inputs and assumptions used, significant judgments made, [and] other information\nthat is important to understand the financial statement effect and, if applicable, policy decisions\nmade by the registrant to calculate the specified disclosures.\u201d2251 Similar to the Proposing\nRelease, in the discussion of the financial statement disclosures above, we provided certain non-\nexclusive examples of the types of contextual information that registrants may be required to\ndisclose depending on the particular facts and circumstances. We agree with the commenters\nwho stated that contextual information will help investors understand the required financial\nstatement effects.2252 The financial statement disclosures we are adopting may involve\nestimation uncertainties that are driven by the application of judgments and assumptions, like\ncertain other financial statement disclosures,2253 and therefore disclosure of contextual\ninformation will facilitate investors\u2019 understanding of the financial statement effects and will be\nan integral part of the financial statements.\n2250 See id.\n2251 See id.\n2252 See supra note 2232 and accompanying text.\n2253 For example, the application of FASB ASC Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and ASC\nTopic 326 Financial Instruments \u2014 Credit Losses require the application of judgment when applying\nGAAP to the financial statements. FASB ASC 275-10-50-6 through 50-15A require the disclosure of\ninformation about certain significant estimates. In addition, FASB ASC 235-10-05-3, 05-4, and 50-1\nrequire the disclosure of information about accounting policies.\n522\n\nIn response to certain commenters\u2019 requests for clarification or additional guidance,2254 as\nnoted above, we decided to include in the final rules two additional types of contextual\ninformation that will enhance investors\u2019 understanding of the financial statement disclosures.\nWe have decided to include \u201csignificant judgments\u201d as an additional type of contextual\ninformation in the final rules because registrants will need to exercise judgment when preparing\ntheir disclosures, and disclosing contextual information about those judgments will help\ninvestors understand and evaluate the reasonableness of the disclosures.2255 Given the narrower\nscope of the disclosure requirements that we are adopting, we expect that the final rules require\nfewer inputs and assumptions than would have been required under the proposal; however, we\nare retaining the references to inputs and assumptions in the final rules because it is possible,\nthough less likely, that preparation of the financial statement disclosures could involve\nestimation uncertainty and require the registrant to exercise judgment in the selection of inputs\nand assumptions.2256 In addition, to enhance understanding of the financial statement\ndisclosures, the final rules explicitly require disclosure of other information that is important to\nunderstand the financial statement effects.2257 In section II.K.3.c.iv above, we have specified one\ninstance where the final rules require registrants to disclose this type of contextual information\nbecause we think the information is important to understand the financial statement effects of the\n2254 See supra note 2239 and accompanying text.\n2255 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(a). Registrants are regularly required to exercise judgment when applying GAAP to\nprepare their financial statements and therefore the fact that the final rules will require registrants to\nexercise judgment is not unusual. For example, FASB ASC Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers requires an entity to disclose significant judgments in the application of the guidance (ASC 606-\n10-50-17), FASB ASC Topic 820 Fair Value Measurement requires an entity to disclose judgments and\nassumptions about assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the financial statements, and FASB ASC\nTopic 842 Leases requires a lessees to disclose information about significant assumptions and judgments\nmade in applying the requirements of Topic 842.\n2256 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(a).\n2257 See id.\n523\n\ndisclosed capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, or losses.2258 By requiring the\ndisclosure of information that is important to understand the financial statement effects, the\nrequirement to provide contextual information will also help registrants avoid having incomplete\nand potentially misleading disclosures.\nWe disagree with the commenters who stated that requiring disclosure of contextual\ninformation would result in inconsistent and incomparable information that is not useful for\ninvestors.2259 On the contrary, the requirement to provide contextual information will improve\nthe comparability of disclosures by enabling investors to understand how registrants have\nexercised judgment and made assumptions in determining the financial statement effect. This\nwill enable investors to compare judgments and assumptions made by registrants, including\nacross industries, which will provide investors with useful information for purposes of their\ninvestment and voting decisions. Furthermore, although we are clarifying aspects of the\ncontextual information requirement, we disagree with the commenters who stated that the\nrequirement to provide contextual information should be simplified and that more guidance is\nneeded with respect to the level of detail required.2260 The final rules intentionally provide\nflexibility to registrants to allow them to include contextual information that is tailored to their\nparticular circumstances thereby improving the usefulness for investors of the disclosures. One\ncommenter stated that a registrant would be required to make many assumptions and policy\ndecisions to disclose contextual information.2261 As noted above, the final rules focus on\nrequiring the disclosure of capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses incurred\n2258 See id.\n2259 See supra note 2236 and accompanying text.\n2260 See supra notes 2237 and 2238 and accompanying text.\n2261 See supra note 2236 and accompanying text.\n524\n\nas a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions, which require fewer\nassumptions and policy decisions by the registrant than would have been required under the\nproposed rules. As a result, we expect the extent of contextual information provided under the\nfinal rules will be reduced as compared to the proposal.\nWe are also adopting the requirements (Rule 14-01(c)) for registrants to calculate the\nfinancial statement effects using financial information that is consistent with the scope of the rest\nof the registrant\u2019s consolidated financial statements and to apply the same set of accounting\nprinciples that a registrant is required to apply in preparation of the rest of its consolidated\nfinancial statements, consistent with the proposal.2262 As the Commission explained in the\nProposing Release, requiring registrants to calculate the financial statement disclosures using\nfinancial information that is consistent with the scope of the rest of the registrant\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial statements will avoid potential confusion, maintain consistency, and aid\ncomparability.2263 In addition, we agree with the commenter who stated that applying the same\nset of accounting principles to the financial statement disclosures will aid comparability.2264 We\nare not aware of any circumstances where the final rules will require a registrant to deviate from\nGAAP, and therefore we are striking the words \u201c[w]henever applicable\u201d from the final rules, in\nresponse to the commenter who stated that this phrase was confusing because it could imply that\n2262 See 17 CFR 210.14-01(c).\n2263 See Proposing Release, section II.F.1. As noted above, one commenter stated that the proposed rule\n\u201cmakes no allowance for wholly-owned subsidiaries, which may lead to duplication and double counting.\u201d\nSee supra note 2244 and accompanying text. Although the comment letter does not provide additional\ncontext for this statement, we think the commenter may have the misimpression that the proposed\ndisclosure threshold would have been evaluated at the parent and subsidiary level separately. On the\ncontrary, and as proposed, the final rules will require registrants to calculate the financial statement\ndisclosure using financial information that is consistent with the scope of the rest of its consolidated\nfinancial statements included in the filing, which we do not believe would result in any double-counting or\nduplication.\n2264 See supra note 2241 and accompanying text.\n525\n\nthe Commission is aware of circumstances where the applicable accounting principles would be\ninconsistent with GAAP.2265 In addition, it is important for investors to be provided with\ninformation that is consistent across financial statements.\nAs discussed above, the Commission also received feedback about whether registrants\nshould be required to calculate the proposed financial statement metrics at a reportable segment\nlevel or to present the metrics by geographic areas.2266 The Commission did not propose such\nrequirements and\u2014although we do not necessarily agree with those commenters that stated\nrequiring disclosure at a segment or geographic level would be too complex or result in the\ndisclosure of irrelevant information2267\u2014we think the approach to disclosure we are adopting\nstrikes an appropriate balance between providing consistent, comparable, and decision-useful\ninformation to investors and the associated burdens to registrants.\nFinally, several areas of commenter question or concern related to the requirements\ndiscussed above are addressed by our decision to not adopt the proposed Financial Impact\nMetrics and to focus on the disaggregation and disclosure of discrete transactions that are\nrecorded in the financial statements. For example, concerns about the interaction between\nGAAP and the proposed Financial Impact Metrics will not apply to the final rules.2268 For the\nsake of clarity, however, we reiterate that the rules the Commission is adopting require\nregistrants to apply existing GAAP recognition and measurement requirements to the financial\nstatement disclosures.\n2265 See supra note 2242 and accompanying text.\n2266 See supra notes 2247 and 2248 and accompanying text.\n2267 See supra note 2248 and accompanying text.\n2268 See supra note 2246 and accompanying text.\n526\n\nb. Historical Periods (Rule 14-01(d))\ni. Proposed Rules\nThe Commission proposed to require a registrant to provide disclosure for the registrant\u2019s\nmost recently completed fiscal year and for the historical fiscal year(s) included in the\nregistrant\u2019s consolidated financial statements in the applicable filing.2269 The Proposing Release\nstated that a registrant would not need to provide a corresponding historical metric for a fiscal\nyear preceding its current reporting fiscal year if it is eligible to take advantage of the\naccommodation in 17 CFR 230.409 (\u201cRule 409\u201d) or 17 CFR 240.12b-21 (\u201cRule 12b-21\u201d).2270\nThe Commission explained that requiring disclosure of current and, when known or reasonably\navailable to the registrant without unreasonable effort or expense, historical periods, should\nallow investors to analyze trends in relevant impacts on the consolidated financial statements and\nto better evaluate the narrative trend disclosure provided pursuant to proposed subpart 1500 of\nRegulation S-K.2271\nii. Comments\nA few commenters supported the requirement as proposed.2272 One commenter indicated\nthat the accommodation in Rule 409 or Rule 12b-21 would be sufficient for issuers to rely upon\nwhen historical information subject to disclosure is unknown or not reasonably available.2273 On\nthe other hand, some commenters stated that it was not clear when a registrant could take\n2269 See Proposing Release, section II.F.1.\n2270 See id.\n2271 See id.\n2272 See, e.g., letters from Center Amer. Progress; Morningstar; and Sarasin.\n2273 See letter from Center Amer. Progress.\n527\n\nadvantage of the accommodations provided by these rules or that the requirements applicable to\nthese rules made it difficult for registrants to rely upon them.2274\nMost commenters that provided feedback on the proposed financial statement metrics did\nnot support requiring registrants to provide disclosure for historical period(s) that occurred prior\nto the compliance date of the rule and instead recommended requiring disclosure on a\nprospective basis and phasing in disclosure for historical periods over time.2275 These\ncommenters generally observed that it would be challenging and burdensome for registrants to\nprovide disclosure for historical periods that occurred prior to the compliance date because many\nregistrants do not currently collect or report the information that would have been required under\nthe proposal.2276 One commenter stated that issuers would have to \u201cretroactively estimate their\nhistorical data,\u201d which would be \u201cburdensome and unlikely to produce reliable and consistent\ndisclosures for investors.\u201d2277 Other commenters pointed out that even if historical information\nis available, issuers may not be able to conclude that they had adequate controls in place prior to\nthe compliance date for the rule.2278 As an alternative, some commenters recommended that the\n2274 See, e.g., letters from BOA; CAQ; Cleary Gottlieb; INGAA; RSM US LLP; Soc.

Final Rules\nAfter consideration of comments, we have decided to require a registrant to provide\ndisclosure for historical fiscal year(s) included in a registrant\u2019s consolidated financial statements\non a prospective basis only.2286 Under the final rules (Rule 14-01(d)), disclosure must be\nprovided for the registrant\u2019s most recently completed fiscal year, and to the extent previously\ndisclosed or required to be disclosed, for the historical fiscal year(s), for which audited\nconsolidated financial statements are included in the filing.2287 Subject to the compliance date\ndiscussed below,2288 registrants will be required to provide disclosure for the registrant\u2019s most\nrecently completed fiscal year for which audited financial statements are included in the filing in\nany filings to which the final rules apply; however, registrants are not required to provide\ndisclosure for historical fiscal year(s) included in that filing. For example, subject to the\ncompliance date, a registrant that files its annual report will only be required to provide the\napplicable disclosure for the registrant\u2019s most recently completed fiscal year for which audited\nfinancial statements are included in the filing. For each subsequent fiscal year\u2019s annual report,\nthe registrant will be required to provide the applicable disclosure for an additional fiscal year\nuntil the required disclosure is provided for the entire period covered by the registrant\u2019s financial\nstatements.2289 Initial registration statements are subject to the final rules to the same extent as\n2286 See 17 CFR 210.14-01(d).\n2287 See id.\n2288 See infra section II.O for a discussion of the compliance date for the rules.\n2289 As discussed in more detail above in section II.K.3.c.ii, the final rules call for disclosure triggered off both\nthe balance sheet and the income statement. A registrant that is required to include balance sheets as of the\nend of its two most recent fiscal years and income statements as of the end of its three most recent fiscal\nyears would be required to disclose two years of the financial statement effects that correspond to the\nbalance sheet and three years of the financial statement effects that correspond to the income statement.\nSee 17 CFR 210.3-01(a), 210.3-02(a). An EGC may, in a Securities Act registration statement for the IPO\n530\n\nthe other Commission filings to which the rules apply.2290 Specifically, a registrant engaged in\nan IPO that has a fiscal year that is subject to the final rules is required to provide disclosure for\nthe registrant\u2019s most recently completed fiscal year for which audited financial statements are\nincluded in the filing. However, such registrant will not be required to provide disclosure for any\npreceding fiscal years included in the initial registration statement because as new entrants to the\npublic markets such registrants would not have previously disclosed or been required to disclose\nthe information required by the final rules.2291\nWe agree with those commenters who stated that the disclosure of historical information\nwould be useful for investors because it would illuminate changes to the financial statement\ndisclosures and trends.2292 However, we recognize that it may be difficult for registrants to\ncompile and produce the required disclosures for periods that occurred prior to the compliance\ndate of the rules. Therefore, we are modifying the proposed rules to require registrants to\nprovide disclosure for historical fiscal year(s) only on a prospective basis, which will further\nlimit the burdens on reporting companies or companies considering an IPO without unduly\ncompromising the intended benefit to investors. This modification, when combined with the\nof its equity securities, \u201cprovide audited statements of comprehensive income and cash flows for each of\nthe two fiscal years preceding the date of the most recent audited balance sheet (or such shorter period as\nthe registrant has been in existence).\u201d See 17 CFR 210.3-02(a). A smaller reporting company is required\nto \u201cfile an audited balance sheet as of the end of each of the most recent two fiscal years, or as of a date\nwithin 135 days if the issuer has existed for a period of less than one fiscal year, and audited statements of\ncomprehensive income, cash flows and changes in stockholders\u2019 equity for each of the two fiscal years\npreceding the date of the most recent audited balance sheet (or such shorter period as the registrant has\nbeen in business).\u201d See 17 CFR 210.8-02.\n2290 See 17 CFR 210.14-01(d). See infra section II.L.3 for further discussion of the decision not to provide an\nexemption or transitional relief for registrants engaged in an IPO.\n2291 See 17 CFR 210.14-01(d). See, e.g., letter from KPMG (\u201c[F]or initial public offerings of securities, we\nrecommend that the Commission permit newly public companies on an ongoing basis to provide the\nproposed information only for the most recent fiscal year for which audited financial statements are\nincluded in the initial registration statement.\u201d).\n2292 See supra note 2280.\n531\n\nphased in compliance dates for the final rules, will provide registrants with sufficient time to\nprepare their disclosures.\nFinally, in response to a question raised by a commenter about whether the proposed\nfinancial statement disclosures would need to be restated or adjusted for historical periods if\nclimate-related impacts are not identifiable until after the metrics are first reported,2293 we are\nclarifying that registrants should apply the principles in FASB ASC Topic 250 Accounting\nChanges and Error Corrections or IFRS International Accounting Standard (\u201cIAS\u201d) 8\nAccounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, as appropriate, in these\ncircumstances.\n7. Inclusion of Disclosures in the Financial Statements (Rule 14-01(a))\na. Proposed Rules\nThe Commission proposed to require registrants to include the proposed financial\nstatement metrics in the financial statements, which would result in the metrics being (i) included\nin the scope of any required audit of the financial statements in the relevant disclosure filing, (ii)\nsubject to audit by an independent registered public accounting firm, and (iii) within the scope of\nthe registrant\u2019s ICFR.2294 The proposed disclosures shared many characteristics with other\nfinancial statement disclosures, and the proposed financial statement metrics would reflect\nfinancial data that is derived from the registrant\u2019s consolidated balance sheets, income\nstatements, and statements of cash flows, and would be presented in a similar way to existing\nfinancial statement disclosures.2295 The Commission explained in the Proposing Release that\n2293 See supra note 2285.\n2294 See Proposing Release, section II.F.5.\n2295 See id.\n532\n\nrequiring the proposed financial statement metrics to be included in a note to the financial\nstatements, and therefore subject to audit and within the scope of ICFR, should enhance the\nreliability of the proposed financial statement metrics.2296\nb. Comments\nAs discussed above, a number of commenters stated that the proposed financial statement\nmetrics should be included in the financial statements and subject to audit.2297 One commenter\nexplained that subjecting the disclosures to audit would be important because \u201c[a]s investors, we\nlook to auditors to provide robustly independent challenge to ensure the assumptions and\nestimates underpinning the financial statements are sound, and the statements themselves provide\na fair representation of the entity\u2019s economic health.\u201d2298 Another commenter stated that\nrequiring the disclosures to be audited \u201cwill result in more decision useful information because\ninvestors can presume it to be accurate, truthful, and complete.\u201d2299 In response to a request for\ncomment included in the Proposing Release, a few commenters stated that the proposed financial\nmetrics should not be included in a separate or supplemental document instead of the financial\nstatements.2300 One of these commenters said that doing so \u201ccould send a perverse message that\n2296 See id.\n2297 See supra note 1715 and accompanying text.

J. Reed, et al.\n2300 See, e.g., letters from Center Amer. Progress; CFA Institute; Sarasin (\u201cWhile we can support a separate\nclimate report that brings together all the material climate-related financial impacts, this should not replace\nthe disclosures within the financial statements (including in the Notes) that appropriately reflect the\nfinancial consequences of these climate factors.\u201d); and TotalEnergies. See also letter from CalSTRS (\u201cWe\nprefer the information to be included in existing reports instead of additional reports; companies already\npublish sustainability-related reports or webpages with climate information that is disconnected from\nfinancial data.\u201d).\n533\n\nclimate impacts are not financial or material for corporate earnings and financial condition,\nwhich would, in our view, be misleading.\u201d2301 One commenter suggested that the Commission\napply the ICFR requirements set forth in Item 308 of Regulation S-K to the proposed financial\nstatement metrics, if finalized.2302\nConversely, a number of commenters were opposed to including the financial impact of\nclimate-related risks in the financial statements.2303 As discussed above, many commenters\nasserted the disclosures should instead be included in the MD&A section of a registrant\u2019s\nperiodic reports.2304 Other commenters stated that the proposed disclosures should be included\nalongside the proposed amendments to Regulation S-K in the new climate-related discussion\nsection.2305 A few commenters stated that if the Commission adopts the proposed financial\nstatement metrics, then they should be provided in supplemental information or a schedule\noutside of the financial statements,2306 although some of these commenters had different views\nabout whether disclosure in a supplemental schedule should be subject to audit and ICFR\n2301 See letter from Sarasin (noting that there could be an argument for companies to both include climate\nimpacts in their existing financial statements as proposed and publish a stand-alone audited climate report,\nwhich aggregates climate impacts).\n2302 See letter from RSM US LLP.\n2303 See, e.g., letters from ACLI; AFEP; APCIA; Cleveland Cliffs; Cohn Rez.; D.

For example, one\ncommenter suggested that the Commission defer making a determination until after issuers have\nhad an opportunity to familiarize themselves with any new requirements.2314 In addition, one\ncommenter stated that the Commission should not impose any financial statement disclosure\nrequirements or require certifications pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until generally\naccepted accounting rules have been established by the FASB.2315 A few commenters suggested\nincluding the proposed financial statement metrics outside of the financial statements initially\nwith a transition to the financial statements.2316\nA few commenters stated that PCAOB auditing standards would be applicable or should\nbe applied to the proposed financial statement metrics.2317 A number of commenters asserted\nthat it would be necessary to develop additional guidance regarding the application of PCAOB\nauditing standards to the proposed financial statement metrics.2318 One commenter stated that\nguidance would be helpful to registrants because it would \u201cbetter enable them to effectively\nobtain or prepare necessary data, information and analysis, and for auditors to obtain sufficient\nappropriate audit evidence related to these metrics.\u201d2319 Some commenters suggested particular\nstandards for which additional specific guidance would be needed for the proposed financial\n2314 See letter from TIAA.\n2315 See letter from RILA.

See also letters from CAQ (noting that there could be a situation where the\nclimate-related metrics are in scope for the audit, but the underlying financial statement line items\nordinarily would not be because of the risk assessment judgments made by the auditor and therefore\nauditors may decide to scope in these lower risk accounts, which could create significant inefficiencies and\nincreased audit costs with minimal benefits for investors); and Baker Tilly (stating that some of the items\nwithin the proposed financial statement metrics might not be part of significant, in-scope accounts subject\nto PCAOB auditing standards).\n2322 See, e.g., letters from BOA; Climate Accounting Audit Project; Eni Spa; Mazars; Sarasin; and Williams\nCos.\n2323 See letter from Sarasin.\n2324 See letter from Climate Accounting Auditing Project.\n2325 See letter from Chamber.\n537\n\nAnother commenter suggested that the audits of any expenditures and costs related to\nsevere weather events and other natural conditions should be a separate assurance engagement\noutside of the scope of the current financial statement and internal controls audits and that these\nseparate engagements should be governed by clearly defined weather-related cost accounting\nstandards and an appropriately tailored PCAOB assurance standard that provides implementation\nexamples.2326 One commenter suggested that the Commission consider allowing sustainability\nconsultants or experts outside of the traditional accounting sector to audit the proposed financial\nstatement metrics.2327 Another commenter stated that it may be necessary for an auditor to tailor\nits audit opinion to explain that the note to the financial statements was not prepared in\naccordance with IFRS disclosure requirements, but in accordance with Commission disclosure\nrequirements and based upon financial statement information prepared in accordance with\nIFRS.2328\nAlternatively, some commenters asserted that there are no clearly established auditing\nstandards for registrants with respect to the proposed financial statement metrics.2329 One\ncommenter argued that \u201c[g]iven the subjectivity inherent in assigning the required quantitative\nfinancial impacts, it is unclear how auditors will evaluate and subsequently provide assurance\nwith respect to these decisions and the associated disclosures.\u201d2330 Another commenter\n2326 See letter from Cohn Rez.\n2327 See letter from I. Millenaar.\n2328 See letter from CFA Institute.\n2329 See, e.g., letters from FedEx; G. Farris; Marathon; NAM; and Sullivan Cromwell.\n2330 See letter from NAM.\n538\n\nsuggested that it would be preferable to include the proposed financial statement metrics outside\nof the financial statements to avoid \u201cdistracting\u201d the PCAOB from its \u201ccore mission.\u201d2331\nWith respect to timing, one commenter stated that any changes to PCAOB standards\nwould need to be implemented and effective before the proposed disclosures are required to be\nincluded in the audited financial statements.2332 Another commenter stated that the Commission\nwill have to instruct the PCAOB to prioritize the development and adoption of standards for\nauditing the proposed financial statement metrics.2333 Another commenter asserted that the\nproposed timeline for adoption of final rules would not provide issuers with enough time to\nintegrate a robust ICFR framework for the proposed financial impact metrics that would be\nauditable.2334\nIn the Proposing Release, the Commission solicited comment on whether it would be\nclear that the proposed climate-related financial statement metrics would be included in the\nscope of the audit when the registrant files financial statements prepared in accordance with\nIFRS as issued by the IASB, and whether it would be clear that the proposed rules would not\nalter the basis of presentation of financial statements as referred to in an auditor\u2019s report.2335 The\nCommission also solicited comment on whether it should amend Form 20-F, or other forms, to\nclarify the scope of the audit or the basis of presentation.2336 In response, one commenter\nasserted that disclosure of the basis of presentation is important for understanding and\n2331 See letter from D. Burton, Heritage Fdn.\n2332 See letter from RSM US LLP.\n2333 See letter from CalPERS.\n2334 See letter from G. Farris.\n2335 See Proposing Release, section II.F.5.\n2336 See id.\n539\n\ncomparability, and noted that since the basis of presentation of climate-related financial metrics\nmay be different from the basis of presentation of the financial statements due to boundary\ndifferences, there should be disclosure when these differ.2337 One commenter stated that the\nCommission should amend Form 20-F and other forms to make it clear that the scope of the\naudit must include the proposed financial statement footnote.2338 On the other hand, one\ncommenter stated that the scope of the audit is clear, and therefore it did not believe it was\nnecessary to amend Form 20-F.2339 One commenter asserted that the proposed climate-related\nfinancial statement metrics and related audit requirements for foreign filers should align with\nthose for domestic filers.2340 Another commenter stated that foreign private issuers should be\nallowed to disclose the proposed financial statement metrics as unaudited supplemental financial\ninformation.2341\nSome commenters stated that the audit and ICFR assessment required for the proposed\nfinancial statement metrics would result in significant costs for registrants2342 or would result in\nan increase in audit fees for registrants.2343 A few commenters stated that they expected the\naudit costs would be higher than the estimated amount included in the proposal.2344 For\nexample, a registrant stated that its auditors estimated the cost of the audit to be within the range\n2337 See letter from ERM CVS.\n2338 See letter from Center Amer.

Final Rules\nAs explained above, we believe it is appropriate to require that the financial statement\neffects disclosure we are adopting be presented in a note to the financial statements (Rule 14-\n01(a)).2355 Identifying a specific location for the disclosures \u2013 a note to the financial statements\n\u2013 will make the information more accessible for investors.2356 In addition, we agree with the\ncommenter that stated that including the disclosure of the financial statement effects in the\nfinancial statements will facilitate investor decision-making.2357 As is true of any disclosures\nincluded in the financial statements, subjecting the required disclosures to a financial statement\naudit and registrants\u2019 ICFR will enhance the reliability of that information. The scope of the\nfinal rules is significantly narrower than the proposal and requires the disclosure of costs and\nexpenditures for transactions that are currently recorded in registrants\u2019 books and records and\nmaterially impacted financial estimates and assumptions. These modifications will ease many of\nthe burdens that registrants identified with respect to requiring the disclosures to be subject to\naudit and ICFR.\nWe considered the various alternatives suggested by commenters, including whether to\nrequire the disclosure of financial statement effects to be provided in supplemental information\n2354 See, e.g., letters from BOA; LTSE; NAM; Soc. Corp. Gov.; and TotalEnergies.\n2355 See 17 CFR 210.14-01(a).\n2356 See, e.g., letters from PGIM; and UAW Retiree. See also IAC Recommendation (indicating its support for\nrequiring the presentation of disclosures in the financial statements and stating \u201c[m]aking this information\navailable in a predictable way that is consistent with the location of other important data helps achieve the\ngoal of consistent dissemination of this important information\u201d).\n2357 See letter from Sarasin.\n542\n\nor a schedule outside of the financial statements.2358 The financial statement disclosures we are\nadopting, however, present financial information that is derived from registrants\u2019 books and\nrecords and is already included in registrants\u2019 financial statements. Therefore, presenting this\ninformation in a note to the financial statements, consistent with other financial statement\ndisclosures, will enhance its accessibility and usefulness for investors. We do not think it would\nbe appropriate to exempt these financial statement disclosures from audit or ICFR requirements.\nProviding an exemption from audit or ICFR for the financial statement disclosure requirements\nin the final rules could confuse investors about which parts of the financial statements are\ncovered by audit and ICFR. Nevertheless, the phase in periods provided for in the final rules\nshould give registrants and their auditors time to familiarize themselves with the new\nrequirements before the compliance date and should help to mitigate the concerns raised by\ncommenters.\nWith respect to auditing standards, PCAOB standards can and will apply to the financial\nstatement disclosures included in a note to the financial statements. We understand that a\nnumber of commenters raised concerns about applying PCAOB standards and stated that\nadditional guidance would be needed.2359 The modifications made to the final rules to narrow\ntheir scope to capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses derived from\ntransactions and amounts recorded in registrant\u2019s books and records underlying the financial\nstatements and materially impacted estimates and assumptions, along with the Commission\u2019s\nadoption of an attribution principle, will help to mitigate commenters\u2019 concerns about the\nauditability of the disclosures. In light of these modifications, we expect that including the\n2358 See supra notes 2306 and 2308 and accompanying text.\n2359 See, e.g., supra note 2318 and accompanying text.\n543\n\nfinancial statement note as part of the audited financial statements will allow the disclosures to\nbe readily incorporated into the scope of the financial statement and ICFR audits that registrants\ncurrently obtain and that existing PCAOB auditing standards will readily apply.\nSeveral commenters raised concerns about how auditors would address the one percent\ndisclosure threshold when considering materiality in planning and performing an audit.2360\nAuditors should apply the concepts of materiality in PCAOB AS 2105, Consideration of\nMateriality in Planning and Performing an Audit, to the rules we are adopting. In applying the\nconcept of materiality, auditors should remain alert for misstatements that could be material due\nto quantitative or qualitative factors and lesser amounts of misstatement could influence the\njudgment of a reasonable investor because of qualitative factors.2361 Under PCAOB Auditing\nStandards, auditors should also evaluate whether, in light of particular circumstances, there are\ncertain accounts or disclosures for which there is a substantial likelihood that misstatements of\nlesser amounts than the materiality level established for the financial statements as a whole\nwould influence the judgment of a reasonable investor. If so, the Auditing Standards provide\nthat the auditor should establish separate materiality levels for those accounts or disclosures to\nplan the nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures for those accounts or disclosures.2362\nAdditionally, there are numerous rules in Regulation S-X as well as other disclosure\nrequirements within GAAP that include a percentage disclosure threshold.2363 Based on staff\n2360 See supra note 2321 and accompanying text.\n2361 See PCAOB AS 2105, paragraph .03.\n2362 See id., paragraph .07.\n2363 See, e.g., supra note 2063 and accompanying text; FASB ASC 280-10-50-12 (requiring the reporting of\nseparate information about an operating segment that meets certain quantitative thresholds), 280-10-50-14\n(stating that if total of external revenue reported by operating segments constitutes less than 75% of total\nconsolidated revenue, additional operating segments shall be identified as reportable segments (even if they\n544\n\nexperience, we understand that auditors have developed procedures for auditing such disclosures\nand have not claimed an inability to audit that information. We expect auditors similarly will be\nable to apply the concepts of materiality and to audit the financial statement disclosures included\nin the final rules, particularly given the final rules\u2019 narrower scope. Therefore, there is no need\nto delay the requirement to obtain an audit or exclude the financial statement disclosures from\nthe scope of the audit or the registrants\u2019 ICFR. The rules we are adopting will provide the\nsuitable criteria necessary for the disclosures to be subject to audit. Nevertheless, the\nCommission will work with the PCAOB to address any issues that come to light regarding the\nauditing of this information and will consider issuing additional guidance to the extent needed\nand helpful.\nFinally, we do not agree with the commenter who suggested that consultants or experts\noutside of the traditional accounting sector should be allowed to audit the proposed financial\nstatement disclosures.2364 The auditor\u2019s unqualified opinion contains an expression of opinion\non the financial statements, taken as a whole, which refers to a complete set of financial\nstatements, including the related financial statements notes and any related schedules.2365 As\nstated above, we expect that the audit procedures applied to the financial statement note will be\ndo not meet the criteria in paragraph 280-10-50-12) until at least 75% of total consolidated revenue is\nincluded in reportable segments), 280-10-50-42 (stating, among other things, that if revenues from\ntransactions with a single external customer amount to 10% or more of a public entity\u2019s revenues, the\npublic entity shall disclose that fact, the total amount of revenues from each such customer, and the identity\nof the segment or segments reporting the revenues), and 323-10-50-3 (requiring, among other things,\ndisclosure of the names of any significant investee entities in which the investor holds 20% or more of the\nvoting stock, but the common stock is not accounted for on the equity method, together with the reasons\nwhy the equity method is not considered appropriate, and the names of any significant investee\ncorporations in which the investor holds less than 20% of the voting stock and the common stock is\naccounted for on the equity method, together with the reasons why the equity method is considered\nappropriate).\n2364 See supra note 2327 and accompanying text.\n2365 See PCAOB AS 3101, paragraph .08, The Auditor\u2019s Report on an Audit of the Financial Statements When\nthe Auditor Expresses an Unqualified Opinion.\n545\n\nincorporated into the scope of registrants\u2019 current financial statement and internal controls audit\nand therefore PCAOB-registered public accounting firms will be able to apply sufficient,\nappropriate audit procedures to these disclosures as required by law.2366 Moreover, PCAOB-\nregistered accounting firms are subject to periodic inspection by the PCAOB and are required to\ncomply with PCAOB rules, including a requirement to establish a system of quality control that\nis implemented throughout the accounting firm, which will enhance investors\u2019 confidence in the\naccuracy of registrants\u2019 disclosures.\nHowever, this does not mean that the auditor cannot use the work of an auditor specialist\nwhile performing its work if the auditor determines doing so would be appropriate in accordance\nwith applicable auditing standards. PCAOB AS 2101, paragraph .16, Audit Planning, states that\nauditors should determine whether specialized skill or knowledge, such as an auditor specialist,\nis needed to perform the appropriate risk assessments, plan or perform audit procedures, or\nevaluate audit results. Auditors may use the work of auditors\u2019 specialists to assist in their\nevaluation of significant accounts and disclosures, including accounting estimates. In doing so,\nauditors consider the requirements within PCAOB AS 1201, Supervision of the Audit\nEngagement, when using the work of auditor-employed specialists, and AS 1210, Using the\nWork of an Auditor-Engaged Specialists, when using the work of an auditor engaged specialist,\nas appropriate.\nThe Commission received mixed feedback about whether it would be clear that: (i) the\nfinancial statement disclosure requirements would be included in the scope of the audit when a\n2366 See 15 U.S.C. 7212 (\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person that is not a registered public accounting firm to\nprepare or issue, or to participate in the preparation or issuance of, any audit report with respect to any\nissuer, broker, or dealer.\u201d). See also letter from CalPERS (\u201cWe expect that the regular auditor will do the\naudit.\u201d).\n546\n\nregistrant files financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB, and\n(ii) the proposed rules would not alter the basis of presentation of financial statements as referred\nto in an auditor\u2019s report.2367 Therefore, we are clarifying that the financial statement disclosure\nrequirements we are adopting in this release must be included in the scope of the audit when a\nregistrant files financial statements in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB. We believe\nthat these disclosures are important and should be required regardless of the GAAP followed.\nFurthermore, registrants that file financial statements prepared using IFRS as issued by the IASB\nare subject to the existing requirement to comply with Regulation S-X,2368 and we are not aware\nof any policies that would prevent registrants from including the financial statement disclosures\nin a note in the financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB.\nFurther, the final rules will not alter the basis of presentation of financial statements referred to\nin an auditor\u2019s report. The instructions to Form 20-F make it clear that the issuer\u2019s financial\nstatements must be audited in accordance with PCAOB standards.2369 PCAOB AS 3101.08\nstates that the first section of the auditor\u2019s report must include a \u201cstatement identifying each\nfinancial statement and any related schedule(s) that has been audited\u201d and a \u201cstatement\nindicating that the financial statements, including the related notes and any related schedule(s),\nidentified and collectively referred to in the report as the financial statements, were audited.\u201d2370\n2367 See supra notes 2337-2339 and accompanying text.\n2368 See Acceptance from Foreign Private Issuers of Financial Statements Prepared in Accordance with\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards Without Reconciliation to U.S. GAAP, Rel.

    "text": "Finally, a number of commenters argued that the Commission should adopt a safe harbor\nfor the financial statement metrics.2375 Some of these commenters limited their request to\nforward-looking financial disclosures included in the financial statements, while other\ncommenters did not appear to limit their request for a safe harbor to forward-looking financial\ndisclosures. By narrowing the scope of financial statement disclosures and focusing on costs and\nexpenditures for transactions that are currently recorded in registrants\u2019 books and records and\nmaterial financial estimates and assumptions, the final rules avoid many of the complexities\nassociated with the proposed rules and therefore we do not think it would be necessary or\nappropriate to adopt a safe harbor for the financial statement disclosures.\nL. Registrants Subject to the Climate-Related Disclosure Rules and Affected Forms\n1. Proposed Rules\nThe Commission proposed to apply the proposed climate-related disclosure rules to a\nregistrant with Exchange Act reporting obligations pursuant to Exchange Act section 13(a)2376 or\nsection 15(d)2377 and companies filing a Securities Act or Exchange Act registration\nstatement.2378 The Commission proposed to require such registrants to include climate-related\ndisclosures, including the proposed financial statement metrics,2379 in Securities Act or Exchange\n2375 See supra notes 2353 and accompanying text.\n2376 15 U.S.C. 78m(a).\n2377 15 U.S.C. 78o(d).\n2378 See Proposing Release, section II.J.\n2379 See Form 20-F, General Instruction B(d) (stating that Regulation S-X applies to the presentation of\nfinancial information in the form). Although Item 17 and 18 of Form 20-F, and the forms that refer to\nForm 20-F (including Forms F-1 and F-3) permit a foreign private issuer to file financial statements\nprepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB, proposed Article 14 disclosure was nevertheless\nrequired (similar to disclosure required by Article 12 of Regulation S-X). See Acceptance from Foreign\nPrivate Issuers of Financial Statements Prepared in Accordance with International Financial Reporting\nStandards Without Reconciliation to U.S. GAAP, Rel. No. 33-8879 (Dec. 21, 2007) [73 FR 986 (Jan. 4,\n549\n\nAct registration statements (Securities Act Forms S-1, F-1, S-3, F-3, S-4, F-4, and S-11, and\nExchange Act Forms 10 and 20-F)2380 and Exchange Act annual reports (Forms 10-K and 20-F).\nSimilar to the treatment of other important business and financial information, the proposed rules\nalso required registrants to disclose any material change to the climate-related disclosures\nprovided in a registration statement or annual report in their Form 10-Q (or, in certain\ncircumstances, Form 6-K for a registrant that is a foreign private issuer that does not report on\ndomestic forms).2381\nThe Commission proposed to amend Form 20-F and the Securities Act forms that a\nforeign private issuer may use to register the offer and sale of securities under the Securities Act\nto require the same climate-related disclosures as proposed for a domestic registrant.2382 The\nCommission explained that, because climate-related risks potentially impact both domestic and\n2008)], 999, note 136 (stating that \u201cRegulation S\u2013X will continue to apply to the filings of all foreign\nprivate issuers, including those who file financial statements prepared using IFRS as issued by the IASB,\u201d\nbut providing that such issuers \u201cwill comply with IASB requirements for form and content within the\nfinancial statements, rather than with the specific presentation and disclosure provisions in Articles 4, 5, 6,\n7, 9, and 10 of Regulation S-X\u201d).\n2380 Form 20-F is the Exchange Act form used by a foreign private issuer for its annual report or to register a\nclass of securities under section 12 of the Exchange Act. We proposed to amend Part I of Form 20-F to\nrequire a foreign private issuer to provide the climate-related disclosures pursuant to the proposed rules\neither when registering a class of securities under the Exchange Act or when filing its Exchange Act annual\nreport. The proposed rules further required a foreign private issuer to comply with the proposed rules when\nfiling a Securities Act registration statement on Form F-1. Because Form F-1 requires a registrant to\ninclude the disclosures required by Part I of Form 20-F, the proposed amendment to Form 20-F rendered\nunnecessary a formal proposed amendment to Form F-1. We similarly did not propose to formally amend\nForms S-3 and F-3 because the climate-related disclosure would be included in a registrant\u2019s Form 10-K or\n20-F annual report that is incorporated by reference into those Securities Act registration statements.\n2381 Form 6-K is the form furnished by a foreign private issuer with an Exchange Act reporting obligation if the\nissuer: (i) makes or is required to make the information public pursuant to the law of the jurisdiction of its\ndomicile or in which it is incorporated or organized, or (ii) files or is required to file the information with a\nstock exchange on which its securities are traded and which was made public by that exchange, or (iii)\ndistributes or is required to distribute the information to its security holders. See General Instruction B to\nForm 6-K. That instruction currently lists certain types of information that are required to be furnished\npursuant to subparagraphs (i), (ii), and (iii), above. While we proposed to amend Form 6-K to add climate-\nrelated disclosure to the list of the types of information to be provided on Form 6-K, we explained that a\nforeign private issuer would not be required to provide the climate-related disclosure if such disclosure is\nnot required to be furnished pursuant to subparagraphs (i), (ii), or (iii) of General Instruction B.\n2382 See Proposing Release, section II.J.\n550\n\nforeign private issuers regardless of the registrant\u2019s jurisdiction of origin or organization,\nrequiring that foreign private issuers provide this disclosure is important to achieving the\nCommission\u2019s goal of more consistent, reliable, and comparable information across\nregistrants.2383 The Proposing Release further noted that Form 20-F imposes substantially\nsimilar disclosure requirements as those required for Form 10-K filers on matters that are similar\nand relevant to the proposed climate-related disclosures, such as risk factors and MD&A.2384\nThe Commission proposed to exempt SRCs from the proposed Scope 3 emissions\ndisclosure requirement. SRCs would otherwise be subject to all of the proposed rules. The\nCommission did not propose to exempt EGCs from the proposed rules noting that, due to their\nbroad impact across industries and jurisdictions, climate-related risks may pose a significant risk\nto the operations and financial condition of registrants, both large and small.2385 The\nCommission did, however, solicit comment on whether the proposed rules should apply to EGCs\nor to other issuers, such as business development companies (\u201cBDCs\u201d).2386\nThe proposed climate-related disclosure rules would not have applied to asset-backed\nissuers. The proposed rules also would not have required the proposed disclosures on the\nfollowing forms, although the Commission solicited comment regarding such application:\n2383 See id.\n2384 See id.\n2385 See Proposing Release, section II.J.\n2386 A BDC is a closed-end investment company that has a class of its equity securities registered under, or has\nfiled a registration statement pursuant to, section 12 of the Exchange Act, and elects to be regulated as a\nbusiness development company. See section 54 of the Investment Company Act, 15 U.S.C. 80a-53. Like\nother section 12 registrants, BDCs are required to file Exchange Act annual reports.\n551\n\n\u2022 Form 40-F, the Exchange Act form used by a Canadian issuer eligible to report under the\nMultijurisdictional Disclosure System (\u201cMJDS\u201d) to register securities or to file its annual\nreport under the Exchange Act;\n\u2022 Form S-8, the Securities Act form used to register securities pursuant to an employee\nbenefit plan; and\n\u2022 Form 11-K, the Exchange Act form used for annual reports with respect to employee\nstock purchase, savings, and similar plans.2387\nThe Commission also requested comment on whether the Commission should exclude\nSecurities Act registration statements filed in connection with a registrant\u2019s IPO from the scope\nof the proposed climate-related disclosure rules instead of including them, as proposed.2388 The\nCommission further solicited comment on whether to require climate-related disclosure on\nForms S-4 and F-4, as proposed. Specifically, the Commission requested comment on whether it\nshould provide transitional relief for recently acquired companies such that registrants would not\nbe required to provide the climate-related disclosures for a company that is the target of a\nproposed acquisition under Form S-4 or F-4 until the fiscal year following the year of the\nacquisition if the target company is not an Exchange Act reporting company and is not the\nsubject of foreign or alternative climate-related disclosure requirements that are substantially\nsimilar to the Commission\u2019s proposed requirements.\n2387 See Proposing Release, section II.J.\n2388 See id.\n552\n\n2. Comments\nMany commenters supported the proposal to include the climate-related disclosures in\nSecurities Act and Exchange Act registration statements and Exchange Act annual reports.2389\nOne commenter stated that it supported the placement of the climate-related disclosures in a\ncompany\u2019s annual report or registration statement instead of in a separate report because of its\nbelief in integrated reporting, which facilitates a better understanding of a business.2390 Another\ncommenter stated that inclusion of the proposed climate-related disclosures in registrants\u2019 annual\nreports and registration statements will dramatically improve the transparency of climate-related\nissues that affect registrants to the securities markets and drive consistency with which such data\nis prepared, presented, and audited.2391\nMany other commenters opposed requiring the climate-related disclosures to be included\nin existing forms and recommended that some or all of the climate-related disclosures be\nincluded in a new and separately furnished form.2392 Some commenters stated that GHG\nemissions disclosures should be furnished on a separate form, which would be due after the\ndeadline for a registrant\u2019s Exchange Act annual report, among other reasons, to better align this\ndisclosure with GHG emissions reporting pursuant to the EPA\u2019s Greenhouse Gas Reporting\nProgram (\u201cGHGRP\u201d).2393 Other commenters asserted that climate information that was \u201cbeyond\nthat traditionally required for other risk factors\u201d should be furnished supplementally on a new\n2389 See, e.g., letters from Amer. for Fin.

Bankers; ConocoPhillips; GM; and PIMCO.\n553\n\nform.2394 Still other commenters, pointing to what they characterized as the rules\u2019 novelty and\ncomplexity, stated that most of the required climate disclosures should be furnished on one or\nmore separate forms.2395\nOne commenter opposed requiring climate-related disclosures in Securities Act\nregistration statements unless the disclosures are incorporated by reference from another filing\n(e.g., from Form 10-K or 20-F).2396 This commenter stated that excluding climate disclosures\nfrom these registration statements would prevent the climate disclosure rules from acting as a\nbarrier to entry to the capital markets or unnecessarily delaying a pending merger and/or\nacquisition (\u201cM&A\u201d) transaction.2397\nCommenters offered varied input on the application of the proposed rules to SRCs. Some\ncommenters supported exempting SRCs from all of the proposed climate-related disclosure\nrequirements2398 on the grounds that the compliance burden would be disproportionately greater\nfor SRCs, as a proportion of overall revenue.2399 One commenter suggested that SRCs should be\nallowed to opt-out of climate disclosures for a period of ten years following an evaluation of\ncertain factors, including the proportion of public investors and other metrics related to the\n2394 See, e.g., letter from Amer. Chem. Council.

Hileman Consulting (stating that GHG emissions disclosures\nshould be reported on one separate form and disclosures pertaining to climate-related risks, impacts,\ngovernance, risk management, and targets and goals should be reported on another separate form.); FedEx;\nNRF; and RILA.\n2396 See letter from PwC.\n2397 See id.\n2398 See, e.g., letters from Baker Tilly; BIO; BDO USA LLP; MD State Bar; Securities Law Comm.; and Volta.\n2399 See, e.g., letters from OTC Markets; UPS; and Nasdaq.\n554\n\nregistrant\u2019s climate impact.2400 Many commenters2401 supported the proposed exemption for\nScope 3 emissions included in the proposed rules, asserting that SRCs will face significant data\ncollection and reporting costs2402 and that SRCs need time to implement new technologies that\nwill aid data collection and reporting.2403 Other commenters further stated that the Commission\nwas underestimating these compliance costs and the resultant burdens it would impose on\nSRCs.2404 A number of commenters supported the proposed exemption for SRCs given the risk\nthat the reporting burden would be passed to smaller downstream companies and urged the\nCommission to consider the impact of its climate disclosure requirements on those entities when\nconsidering exemptions for SRCs.2405\nSome commenters stated that the proposed rules would discourage private companies\nfrom joining the public markets due to the high cost of complying with climate disclosures.2406\nOther commenters urged the Commission to ameliorate the compliance costs for newly public\ncompanies by implementing exemptions for EGCs2407 and recommended that the Commission\noffer a phase in for newly public companies until the end of the first full fiscal year after going\n2400 See, e.g., letter from Cohn Rez.\n2401 See, e.g., letters from AIMA; Dechert; ICBA; Fidelity; and SIA.\n2402 See, e.g., letter from Fortive (\u201cNotwithstanding the proposed exemption for smaller reporting companies,\nthe administrative and financial costs associated with collecting and measuring such data would be\nparticularly burdensome for many registrants that currently do not report such information on a voluntary\nbasis, especially small, medium-sized and newly reporting companies.\u201d).

Reform, Sunrise Project et al.\n2436 See letter from D. Hileman Consulting.\n559\n\nOther commenters, however, opposed the disclosure of climate-related information on a\nquarterly basis.2437 One commenter stated that an interim updating requirement to report a\nmaterial change in climate-related disclosures is not necessary because Form 10-Q already\nrequires an update to risk factor disclosure provided by registrants other than SRCs and related\nmaterial financial impacts disclosure would be required in an interim MD&A.2438 This\ncommenter further stated that intra-year updates on climate-related disclosures would create\nmeaningful incremental costs for registrants but offer little additional value to investors.2439\nAnother commenter that opposed quarterly updating stated that \u201cmany, if not most, climate\nmetrics, risks, opportunities, and strategies are long-term in nature and cannot meaningfully be\nassessed on a quarter-to-quarter basis.\u201d2440 Other commenters asserted that requiring the\ndisclosure of climate-related information in Form 10-Q, in addition to Form 10-K, would\noverwhelm investors with information of limited usefulness and, due to its novelty, should not be\nrequired to be disclosed in Commission periodic reports.2441\nMany commenters supported not subjecting MJDS filers to the proposed climate\ndisclosure rules, as proposed.2442 Commenters stated that excluding MJDS filers from the\nCommission\u2019s climate disclosure rules would be consistent with the purpose of the MJDS, which\nis to enhance the efficiency of cross-border capital raising between the United States and Canada\n2437 See, e.g., letters from Etsy; and Sullivan Cromwell.\n2438 See letter from Sullivan Cromwell.\n2439 See id.\n2440 Letter from Etsy.\n2441 See, e.g., letters from API; and Chamber.\n2442 See, e.g., letters from ACLI; Barrick Gold Corporation (June 17, 2022) (\u201cBarrick Gold\u201d); Business Council\nof Canada (June 16, 2022) (\u201cBCC\u201d); Can.

Bankers; Davies Ward; and Dorsey.\n2444 See CSA Consultation, Climate-related Disclosure Update and CSA Notice and Request for Comment,\nProposed National Instrument 51-107, Disclosure of Climate-related Matters (Oct. 2021).\n2445 See, e.g., letters from BCC; Can.

Weinstein.\n2449 See letter from AFSA.\n561\n\nrequirements would need to be based on a framework that is particularly suited for asset-backed\nissuers, such as the ABS Climate Disclosure Framework that is being developed by the\nStructured Finance Association.2450 Other commenters stated that, because asset-backed\nsecuritizations are essential for making home mortgages and car loans available to Americans,\nincluding those in low-income communities, and because application of the proposed rules to\nasset-backed issuers would motivate them to exclude such loans from their financed emissions,\nsuch application would result in disproportionate and negative impacts on low-income\ncommunities.2451\nOne commenter expressly opposed excluding asset-backed issuers from the proposed\nrules.2452 This commenter stated that asset-backed issuers are subject to many of the same\nclimate risks as other issuers and require similar disclosure. As an example of the need for such\ndisclosure, this commenter stated that there are growing concerns that asset-backed issuers are\nnot fully disclosing that properties within the asset pools that they securitize are located in areas\nparticularly vulnerable to increased risk of sea-level rise and extreme flooding.2453 Another\ncommenter supported excluding asset-backed issuers from the Commission\u2019s climate disclosure\nrules at this time, but encouraged the Commission to consider, in due time, separate rules\nrequiring climate-related disclosures from such issuers.2454 This commenter stated that, while it\nbelieved that all financial and nonfinancial corporations should be expected to provide consistent\nclimate-related disclosures with respect to their equity or debt (or debtlike) issuances, a more\n2450 See letter from SFA.\n2451 See letters from IECA; and J.

Reform, Sunrise Project et al.\n2453 See id.\n2454 See letter from Morningstar.\n562\n\ntailored, risk-based approach may be more appropriate for climate-related disclosures with\nrespect to securitizations.2455\nOne commenter opposed applying the Commission\u2019s climate disclosure rules to Form S-\n8 filings without stating the reasons why.2456 No commenter addressed whether the proposed\nrules should apply to Form 11-K filings.\nSeveral commenters raised concerns about the application of the proposed disclosure\nrequirements to newly public companies.2457 For example, commenters stated that application of\nthe proposed rules to IPOs could deter many companies from going public due to the increased\ncompliance costs and litigation risks associated with providing the climate-related disclosures,\nwhich would run counter to the Commission\u2019s mission of facilitating capital formation.2458 One\ncommenter further stated that because private companies already face complex, lengthy, and\ncostly processes to prepare for an IPO, the additional compliance burden imposed by the\nproposed climate disclosure rules would have a chilling effect on the use of the public securities\nmarkets to raise capital and on the broader U.S. economy.2459\nCommenters raised similar concerns about the proposed rules in the context of M&A\ntransactions. For example, one commenter stated that, given the scale of the disclosure and work\nnecessary to comply with the proposed climate disclosure rules, having to prepare this disclosure\nfor a private target on a stand-alone basis before the acquiring registrant can file its Form S-4 or\nF-4 to register the securities being issued in connection with the business combination would\n2455 See id.\n2456 See letter from J. Herron.\n2457 See, e.g., letters from AIC; Baker Tilly; BDO USA; Nasdaq; PwC; RILA; Shearman Sterling; SIFMA;\nSoros Fund; and Sullivan Cromwell.\n2458 See, e.g., letters from AIC; and Nasdaq.\n2459 See letter from Nasdaq.\n563\n\nmaterially delay those filings and significantly extend the overall transaction timeline.2460\nAccording to this commenter, public companies could be placed at a competitive disadvantage\nwhen bidding to acquire a private target company under the proposal because it would be\nnecessary to screen prospective acquisitions for the ability to produce climate-related\ndisclosures.2461 Another commenter stated that a private target may not have collected climate-\nrelated data prior to its acquisition, and it could be \u201cincredibly burdensome\u201d for the private\ncompany to go back in time and measure the impact of climate-related events during a period\nwhen it was not collecting such data.2462 Commenters noted that integrating a recently acquired\ncompany takes considerable time and resources, and the Commission should allow for delayed\nreporting so that an acquiring company need not alter its acquisition schedule to account for the\ndifficulties in assuming responsibility for climate-related disclosures.2463 Because of the above\nconcerns, commenters urged the Commission not to adopt compliance deadlines for the proposed\nclimate disclosure requirements that would substantially influence the probability or timing of\nM&A transactions and IPOs.2464\nSome commenters opposed excluding IPO registrants from the scope of the proposed\nclimate disclosure rules.2465 After stating that companies that are going public should be held to\nthe same reporting and disclosure requirements of all other public companies, one commenter\nnoted that the rule proposal already contains a number of accommodations for filers, which\n2460 See letter from Shearman Sterling.\n2461 See id.\n2462 See letter from Nasdaq.\n2463 See letters from Etsy; and Sullivan Cromwell.\n2464 See, e.g., letter from Shearman Sterling.\n2465 See letters from AGs of Cal. et al.; Amer. for Fin. Reform, Sunrise Project et al.; and CFA.\n564\n\nshould not be expanded.2466 Another commenter opposed exempting IPO registrants from the\nproposed rules because that would lower investor protections in the public markets, which is\ncontrary to the Commission\u2019s mission and purpose.2467 One other commenter stated that because\ninvestors need information about a registrant\u2019s climate-related risks at every stage of capital\nformation, it supported requiring a registrant to provide climate-related disclosures about a target\ncompany in its Form S-4 or F-4.2468\n3. Final Rules\nThe final rules will apply to Exchange Act periodic reports2469 and Securities Act and\nExchange Act registration statements largely as proposed, with some modifications as described\nbelow. As we stated above when discussing our reasons for amending Regulations S-K and S-\nX,2470 we are requiring climate-related disclosures in most Securities Act or Exchange Act\nregistration statements and Exchange Act periodic reports. We believe disclosures about\nclimate-related risks and their financial impacts should be treated like other business and\nfinancial information because they are necessary to understand a company\u2019s operating results\nand prospects and financial condition.2471\n2466 See letter from CFA (stating that the proposed rule \u201cincludes a safe harbor with limited reach, phase in\nperiods for compliance, and reasonable boundaries for disclosure, and the Commission should not expand\nor loosen these accommodations.\u201d).\n2467 See letter from AGs of Cal. et al.\n2468 See letter from Amer. for Fin. Reform, Sunrise Project et al.\n2469 Although we generally refer to the final rules applying to Exchange Act periodic reports, the only time a\nregistrant will disclose climate-related information responsive to the final rules in a Form 10-Q is when it\nelects to disclose its Scopes 1 and/or 2 emissions pursuant to Item 1505 of Regulation S-K. A foreign\nprivate issuer that is subject to the GHG emissions reporting requirement, however, is required to provide\nthe GHG emissions disclosure in its annual report on Form 20-F, although it may provide such emissions\ndisclosure on a delayed basis in an amendment to that filing. See supra section II.H. The other portions of\nthe final rules are not applicable to Exchange Act periodic reports other than annual reports.\n2470 See supra section II.A.3.\n2471 See id.\n565\n\nWe are taking this approach instead of adopting a new form for climate-related\ndisclosures as suggested by commenters because it is more consistent with the Commission\u2019s\nintegrated disclosure system for business and financial reporting and will improve the\ntransparency and comparability of climate-related disclosures for investors as they will be\nincluded and incorporated into forms with which registrants and investors alike are familiar, and\nalongside information regarding a registrant\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial\ncondition, which will facilitate an understanding of the impacts of climate-related risks.2472\nWhile we understand the concern of commenters that recommended the creation of a new form\nfor climate-related disclosures,2473 revisions to the proposed rules2474 and strengthened\naccommodations regarding certain types of disclosures2475 and for certain issuers2476 will address\nmany of these concerns.\nThe final rules require registrants that file their Exchange Act annual reports on Forms\n10-K, as well as their Exchange Act and Securities Act registration statements on Form 10 and\nForm S-1, S-4 (except as provided below), or S-11, as applicable, to include the climate-related\ndisclosures required by the final rules in these forms.2477 The final rules will also require foreign\n2472 See, e.g., supra notes 2390 and 2391 and accompanying text.\n2473 See supra notes 2392-2395 and accompanying text.\n2474 See, e.g., the adoption of less prescriptive requirements and a materiality qualifier for several of the final\nrule provisions.\n2475 See, e.g., supra section II.J (discussing the adoption of an expanded safe harbor provision).\n2476 See, e.g., supra section II.H (discussing the exemption from Scopes 1 and 2 emissions reporting for both\nSRCs and EGCs); and infra section II.O (discussing the adoption of different compliance dates for different\ntypes of filers).\n2477 Registrants may incorporate by reference the climate-related disclosures required by the final rules to the\nextent they are permitted to do so under Forms S-1, S-4, and S-11. See, e.g., Form S-1, General Instruction\nVII (setting forth the requirements a registrant must meet in order to incorporate by reference certain\ninformation required by Form S-1). If a registrant is eligible and elects to incorporate by reference certain\ninformation required by Forms S-1, S-4, and S-11, those forms also require the registrant to incorporate by\n566\n\nprivate issuers that file their Exchange Act annual reports or registration statements on Form 20-\nF and their Securities Act registration statements on Form F-1 or Form F-4 (except as provided\nbelow) to provide the same climate-related disclosures as domestic registrants.2478 As\ncommenters noted, because foreign private issuers are exposed to climate-related risks in the\nsame way as domestic registrants, they should be subject to the same disclosure requirements.2479\nApplying the same climate-related disclosure requirements to domestic and foreign registrants\nwill also help achieve the Commission\u2019s goal of providing more consistent, reliable, and\ncomparable information across registrants for investors. While we acknowledge commenters\nwho suggested that foreign private issuers be permitted to substitute compliance with the final\nrules through disclosures made in response to requirements of other jurisdictions, we are not\nadopting substituted compliance at this time. We believe it makes sense to observe how\nreporting under international climate-related reporting requirements and practices develop before\nmaking a determination whether such an approach would result in consistent, reliable, and\ncomparable information for investors. The Commission may consider such accommodations in\nreference its latest Form 10-K and all other Exchange Act reports filed since the end of the fiscal year\ncovered by that Form 10-K. See Form S-1, Item 12; Form S-4, Items 11 and 13; Form S-11, Item 29. In\naddition to those filings that a registrant is required to incorporate by reference, a registrant may also\nincorporate by reference its required emissions disclosure, if applicable, from the prior filing that contained\nsuch disclosure to satisfy its Item 1505 disclosure obligations under Form S-1, S-4, or S-11 if (1) such\nForm S-1, S-4, or S-11 becomes effective after filing its Form 10-K for its latest fiscal year but before filing\na Form 10-K/A or its Form 10-Q for the second quarter of its current fiscal year containing the prior year\u2019s\nemissions disclosure and (2) the registrant, pursuant to Item 1505(c)(1), discloses the information required\nby Item 1505 in either a Form 10-K/A or its second quarter Form 10-Q rather than in its Form 10-K (in\nboth the prior and current fiscal year). See also 17 CFR 230.411 and 17 CFR 240.12b-23.\n2478 Forms S-3 and F-3 are not being amended to reference subpart 1500 because the required climate-related\ndisclosures would be included in a registrant\u2019s Form 10-K or 20-F annual report that is incorporated by\nreference into those Securities Act registration statements. See Proposing Release, section J, note 690.\nHowever, as discussed in section II.H.3 above, we are amending these forms to clarify the date as of which\ndisclosure required by Item 1505(a) must be incorporated.\n2479 See supra note 2429 and accompanying text.\n567\n\nthe future depending on developments in the international climate reporting practices and our\nexperience with disclosures under the final rules.2480\nIn a change from the proposed rules, the final rules will not apply to private companies\nthat are parties to business combination transactions, as defined by Securities Act Rule\n165(f),2481 involving a securities offering registered on Forms S-4 and F-4.2482 We acknowledge\nthe concerns of commenters about the difficulties and costs associated with private target\ncompanies complying with the proposed disclosure requirements in the business combination\ncontext in addition to complying with certain other disclosure requirements under Regulation S-\nK and Regulation S-X,2483 as well as concerns that the application of those requirements to\nprivate target companies could impact the timing of or discourage business combination activity\nin U.S. public markets.2484 Disclosure pursuant to subpart 1500 of Regulation S-K and Article\n2480 See also discussion infra section IV.A.4 and IV.C.3.\n2481 See 17 CFR 230.165.\n2482 While Form S-1 may be used for business combination transactions, climate-related disclosure will also be\nrequired for reporting companies that are parties to the transaction.\n2483 See, e.g., Form S-4, Part I.C, Item 17(b) (requiring, with respect to a company being acquired that is not\nsubject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, a brief description of\nits business, disclosure pursuant to Item 2-01 of Regulation S-K (market price of and dividends on the\ncompany\u2019s equity), disclosure pursuant to Item 303 of Regulation S-K (MD&A), disclosure pursuant to\nItem 304 of Regulation S-K (changes in and disagreements with accountants), and, in certain\ncircumstances, financial information).\n2484 See, e.g., letters from Shearman Sterling (stating that private targets are \u201cunlikely to have the extensive\nclimate change disclosure prepared in advance of entering into a business combination with a public\ncompany.\u201d); and Sullivan Cromwell (stating that, \u201cin addition to having the resources necessary to collect\nemissions data from the target company, acquirors would need to expend significant resources to ensure\nthat (1) it has appropriate controls and procedures in place to assess the quality of the information and (2)\nsuch information is being collected and measured on a basis consistent with the emissions calculations\nthroughout its organization.\u201d).\n568\n\n14 of Regulation S-X will only be required for a registrant or company being acquired that is\nsubject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.2485\nIn another change from the proposed rules, the final rules will not require registrants to\ndisclose any material change to the climate-related disclosures provided in a registration\nstatement or annual report in its Form 10-Q or, in certain circumstances, Form 6-K for a\nregistrant that is a foreign private issuer that does not report on domestic forms. This is\nconsistent with the annual reporting requirement adopted by the Commission in other\ncontexts.2486 We are mindful of the concern expressed by many commenters about the potential\ncompliance costs of the proposed rules, including the proposed interim updating requirement.2487\nThis change will help to mitigate the compliance burden.2488\n2485 The discussion throughout this release regarding the application of the subpart 1500 disclosure\nrequirements to business combination transactions involving a securities offering registered on Forms S-4\nand F-4 also applies to certain business combination transactions for which a proxy statement on Schedule\n14A or an information statement on Schedule 14C is required to be filed. See 17 CFR 240.14a-101, Item\n14(c)(1) (requiring, for certain business combination transactions, disclosure of \u201cthe information required\nby Part B (Registrant Information) of Form S\u20134 . . . or Form F\u20134 . . . , as applicable, for the acquiring\ncompany\u201d) and Item 14 (c)(2) (requiring, for certain business combination transactions, disclosure of \u201cthe\ninformation required by Part C (Information with Respect to the Company Being Acquired) of Form S-\n4 . . . or Form F-4 . . . , as applicable\u201d); and 17 CFR 240.14c-101, Item 1 (\u201cFurnish the information called\nfor by all of the items of Schedule 14A . . . which would be applicable to any matter to be acted upon at the\nmeeting if proxies were to be solicited in connection with the meeting.\u201d). The information required by\nParts B and C of Forms S-4 and F-4 includes the information required by General Instructions B.3 and C.3\nto those forms. See Form S-4, General Instruction B.3 (\u201cIf the registrant is subject to the reporting\nrequirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, then . . . the information required by subpart\n1500 of Regulation S-K . . . must be provided with respect to the registrant . . . .\u201d); Form F-4, General\nInstruction B.3 (same); Form S-4, General Instruction C.3 (\u201cIf the company being acquired is subject to the\nreporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, then . . . the information required by\nsubpart 1500 of Regulation S-K . . . must be provided with respect to the company being acquired . . . .\u201d);\nForm F-4, General Instruction C.3 (same).\n2486 See, e.g., Modernization of Property Disclosures for Mining Registrants, Release No. 33-10570 (Oct. 31,\n2018) [83 FR 66344 (Dec. 26, 2018)]; and Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and\nIncident Disclosure, Release No. 33-11216 (Jul. 26, 2023) [88 FR 51896 (Aug. 4, 2023)].\n2487 See, e.g., letter from Sullivan Cromwell.\n2488 See supra note 2469.\n569\n\nAlso as proposed, the final rules will not apply to Canadian registrants that use the MJDS\nand file their Exchange Act registration statements and annual reports on Form 40-F. As many\ncommenters stated, excluding MJDS filers from the Commission\u2019s climate disclosure rules is\nconsistent with the purpose of the MJDS and will continue to allow MJDS registrants to follow\ntheir home jurisdiction laws and rules when registering securities in the United States and\nsatisfying their reporting obligations under the Exchange Act.2489\nThe proposed rules would have required SRCs to comply with all of the proposed\nclimate-related disclosure requirements, except for disclosure pertaining to Scope 3 emissions,\nfrom which they were proposed to be exempted.2490 Similarly, most of the final rules will apply\nto SRCs, except for the disclosures requiring Scopes 1 and 2 emissions, from which SRCs will\nbe exempted.2491 Although some commenters asked the Commission to exclude SRCs from all\nof the Commission\u2019s climate disclosure rules,2492 we do not believe that such a blanket\nexemption would be appropriate in light of the fact that, as some commenters noted, SRCs are\nexposed to climate-related risks to the same extent as other registrants.2493 For similar reasons,\nthe final rules will apply to EGCs, as proposed, except for the exemption regarding Scopes 1 and\n2 emissions disclosure. However, we acknowledge that some aspects of the final rules could\nimpose significant burdens on smaller and early growth stage registrants, particularly if the costs\nof compliance do not scale with the size of the firm and divert resources that are needed to\nexpand the registrant\u2019s business. Because we expect the compliance burden and costs for the\n2489 See supra note 2443 and accompanying text.\n2490 See Proposing Release, section II.J.\n2491 As discussed in section II.H.3 above, the final rules will not require any registrant to disclose its Scope 3\nemissions.\n2492 See supra notes 2398 and 2417 and accompanying text.\n2493 See supra notes 948 and 2419 and accompanying text.\n570\n\nGHG emissions disclosure requirement to be proportionally greater for such registrants, not\nrequiring SRCs and EGCs to disclose their Scopes 1 and/or 2 emissions will help address these\nconcerns. For these reasons, we find that it is necessary and appropriate in the public interest\nand consistent with the protection of investors to not include SRCs and EGCs within the scope of\nthe GHG emissions disclosure requirement,2494 but to include them within the scope of the other\naspects of the final rules.2495 Moreover, the streamlined requirements and disclosure\naccommodations we are adopting, which will help limit the compliance burden of the final rules\nfor all registrants, should further alleviate commenters\u2019 concerns about the impact of the\nproposed rules on SRCs and EGCs. In particular, adding materiality qualifiers and making\nseveral of the disclosure provisions less prescriptive should enable registrants, including SRCs\nand EGCs, to provide disclosure that better fit their particular facts and circumstances, which\nshould lessen the need for scaled disclosure for SRCs and EGCs. Additionally, as discussed\nbelow, we are providing extended phase ins based on filer status, which will provide SRCs and\nEGCs with additional time to prepare for the final rules.\nSimilarly, we are not providing an exemption or transitional relief for registrants engaged\nin an IPO, as recommended by some commenters, because of these streamlined requirements and\nother accommodations.2496 In addition, we note that exempting EGCs from the GHG emissions\ndisclosure requirement will significantly reduce the compliance burden of the final rules for most\n2494 All registrants subject to the final rules, including SRCs and EGCs, are not required to disclose GHG\nemissions metrics other than as required by Item 1505, including where GHG emissions are included as\npart of a transition plan, target or goal.\n2495 See 15 U.S.C. 77z-3 and 15 U.S.C. 78mm.\n2496 See supra note 2457 and accompanying text.\n571\n\nnew registrants, as historically EGCs have accounted for almost 90% of IPO companies.2497\nMoreover, providing a longer transition period before SRCs and EGCs must first comply with\nthe final rules should help those entities that go public to develop the appropriate controls and\nprocedures for providing the required climate-related disclosures. We further note that initial\nfilings from registrants that are not SRCs or EGCs and that determine that they have material\nScope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions will only be required to provide emissions data for one year\nbecause they will not have previously provided such disclosure in a Commission filing.2498\nThe final rules also will not apply to asset-backed securities issuers, as proposed.\nAlthough we recognize that, as one commenter noted, climate-related risks may be relevant for\nsome of the pooled assets that comprise certain asset-backed securities,2499 we believe that\nadoption of climate-related disclosure requirements for certain types of securities, such as asset-\nbacked securities, should consider the unique structure and characteristics of those securities,\nconsistent with other Commission disclosure requirements applicable to asset-backed securities\nissuers.2500 Accordingly, while the Commission may consider climate-related disclosure\nrequirements for asset-backed securities issuers in a future rulemaking, we decline to adopt such\nrequirements as part of this rulemaking.\nWe are not exempting other registrants, such as BDCs, REITs, or issuers of registered\nnon-variable insurance contracts from the final rules. As with operating companies, these\n2497 Wilmer Hale, 2023 IPO Report, 2 (Mar. 31, 2023), available at\nhttps://www.wilmerhale.com/insights/publications/2023-ipo-report (\u201cIPOs by emerging growth companies\n(EGCs) accounted for 87% of the year\u2019s IPOs, a share modestly lower than the 93% in 2021 and the 89%\naverage that has prevailed since enactment of the JOBS Act in 2012.\u201d).\n2498 See supra section II.H.3.\n2499 See supra notes 2452 and 2453 and accompanying text.\n2500 See supra note 2450 and accompanying text. See also 17 CFR 229.1100 through 229.1125 (Regulation\nAB).\n572\n\nentities may face material climate-related risks that would impact an investment or voting\ndecision and will have only limited disclosure obligations to the extent climate-related risks are\nnot material in a given case. We acknowledge commenters that noted that certain registered\ncollective investment vehicles have differences from operating companies, but, in our view,\nthose differences are not significant enough in this context to warrant the differential treatment\nwe are applying to asset-backed securities issuers. Further, because the final rules have been\nmodified and streamlined from proposed, as described above, to the extent a climate-related risk\nis not material to such registrants the information required to be disclosed would be limited.\nLikewise, we are not exempting BDCs as suggested by other commenters. While we\nacknowledge that, if the Commission\u2019s proposed rules regarding ESG disclosures for certain\ninvestment advisers and investment companies were adopted, there may be some overlap in the\nrequired disclosures, we nonetheless believe that the climate-related information required to be\ndisclosed by the final rules in a registrant\u2019s Securities Act registration statements and Exchange\nAct reports will be important to investors and should apply to BDCs and REITs. Finally, with\nrespect to issuers of registered non-variable insurance contracts, if the final rules would\notherwise apply solely as a result of a registrant\u2019s offerings of registered index-linked annuities,\nthe final rules may not apply prior to required compliance.2501 To the extent such a registrant is\nsubject to the final rules in connection with offerings of other types of registered non-variable\n2501 See Division AA, Title I of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, Pub. L. 117-328; 136 Stat. 4459\n(Dec. 29, 2022) and Registration for Index-Linked Annuities; Amendments to Form N\u20134 for Index-Linked\nand Variable Annuities (\"RILA Act\"), Release No. 33-11250 (Sept. 29, 2023) [17 FR 71088 (Oct. 13,\n2023)]. If the Commission adopts this proposal substantially as proposed, or insurers are able to register\nofferings of registered index-linked annuities on Form N-4 pursuant to a provision in the RILA Act, the\nregistration statement for a registered-index linked annuity would not be required to include the\ninformation required by the final rules adopted in this release. We also anticipate that in these\ncircumstances insurance companies generally will rely on Exchange Act Rule 12h-7 if they would\notherwise be subject to Exchange Act reporting obligations solely by reason of their offerings of registered\nindex-linked annuities.\n573"

Structured Data Requirement (Item 1508)\n1. Proposed Rules\nThe proposed rules would have required a registrant to tag the proposed climate-related\ndisclosures in a structured, machine-readable data language. Specifically, the proposed rules\nwould have required a registrant to tag climate-related disclosures in Inline eXtensible Business\nReporting Language (\u201cInline XBRL\u201d) in accordance with 17 CFR 232.405 (Rule 405 of\nRegulation S-T) and the EDGAR Filer Manual.

One supportive commenter\nstated that the Commission should consider developing guidance to help standardize climate-\nrelated custom tags \u201cto foster comparability and faster access across corporate disclosures.\u201d2507\nYet another supportive commenter recommended that \u201cthe Commission avoid custom tags\nwould be a departure from other areas of Securities and Exchange Act filings outside the financial\nstatements and given the differences in the estimates and assumptions used to calculate Scope 1, 2, and 3\nemissions, we believe the use of XBRL for these disclosures would not be meaningful to investors.\u201d).\n2503 See, e.g., letters from ISS ESG; Ceres.\n2504 See, e.g., letters from XBRL International; Ceres.\n2505 See, e.g., letters from Sky Harbor.\n2506 See, e.g., letter from American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers.\n2507 See, e.g., letter from ISS ESG.\n575\n\nwithin the Inline XBRL schema because they erode the comparability of the climate-related\ndisclosures.\u201d2508\nCommenters largely supported the proposal to require tagging of both quantitative\nclimate-related metrics and qualitative climate-related disclosures, stating that tagging will\nmaximize efficiency and make the information easier to consume.2509 One of these commenters\nstated that detail and block text tagging \u201cof all disclosure, as opposed to only quantitative\nmetrics, expedites aggregation, filtering, and synthesis of corporate reporting in addition to\nmaking the reporting more accessible and usable in the first place.\u201d2510 Another commenter\nstated that tagging of both narrative and quantitative information is necessary to increase\nefficiencies in the capital markets as a new volume of information becomes available.2511\nThe Commission also solicited comment on whether there are any third-party taxonomies\nthe Commission should consider in connection with the proposed tagging requirements.2512\nWhile one commenter2513 suggested the registrant should have the ability to select the structured\ndata language it wanted to use, most commenters stated that the Commission should require\ntagging in Inline XBRL, as proposed.2514 One commenter noted the importance of\ninteroperability with international regulators and organizations when considering alternatives.2515\nAnother commenter emphasized that machine-readable data that are interoperable with\n2508 See, e.g., letter from Morningstar.\n2509 See, e.g., letters from CalPERS; ISS ESG; and Morningstar, Inc.

Final Rules\nAfter considering comments, we are adopting the structured data requirements as\nproposed.2519 For registrants that are LAFs, compliance with the structured data requirements\nfor disclosures under subpart 1500 of Regulation S-K will be required for all disclosures\nbeginning one year after initial compliance with the disclosure requirements.2520 Other\ncategories of filers will be required to comply with the tagging requirements upon their initial\ncompliance with subpart 1500. Likewise, with respect to any specific provisions that have an\nextended compliance date that begins on or after the initial tagging compliance date for LAFs,\nfilers will be required to tag such information at initial compliance.2521 Because non-LAF\nregistrants will have a later date than LAF registrants to comply overall with the final rules, we\n2516 See, e.g., letter from Data Fnd, urging the Commission to consider adopting international standards to\nensure the highest possibility for data comparability across reporting regimes and international regulatory\nbodies.\n2517 See, e.g., letter from Ceres (also noting that the ISSB released a Sustainability Disclosure Taxonomy for\npublic comment on May 25, 2022).\n2518 See, e.g., letter from ISS ESG.\n2519 Item 1508 of Regulation S-K and Rule 405(b)(4)(vii) of Regulation S-T (requiring disclosures filed\npursuant to subpart 1500 of Regulation S-K to be submitted as an Interactive Data File). Because financial\nstatements are already structured in Inline XBRL, no new regulatory text is necessary to structure the\ndisclosures filed pursuant to Article 14 of Regulation S-X. See Rule 405(b)(1)(i) of Regulation S-T.\n2520 See infra at section II.O.3 for a more detailed discussion of compliance dates.\n2521 This includes Item 1502(d)(2), Item 1502(e)(2), Item 1504(c)(2), Item 1505, and Item 1506.\n577\n\nare not adopting a separate later compliance date regarding the structured data requirements for\nnon-LAF registrants.\nSince all issuers that will be subject to the final rules must currently tag disclosures in\nInline XBRL,2522 the requirement will not unduly add to companies\u2019 burden, and we believe any\nincremental costs are appropriate given the significant benefits to investors, as detailed by\ncommenters, including improving the usefulness and comparability of disclosures, as well as\nmaking such disclosures easier to locate and review. With respect to the commenter that stated\nthat registrants should not be required to tag climate-related disclosures because they currently\nonly tag financial statement disclosures, we note that all issuers, including smaller reporting\ncompanies, must tag in Inline XBRL cover page disclosures and financial statement disclosures,\nwhich includes both detail and block text tagging. In addition, we note that the limited\nincremental additional cost associated with tagging additional disclosures results in a significant\nbenefit to investors in terms of the ability to readily find and analyze disclosures. As the\nCommission stated in the Proposing Release and as confirmed by commenters, Inline XBRL\ntagging will enable automated extraction and analysis of the information required by the final\nrules, allowing investors and other market participants to more efficiently identify responsive\ndisclosure, as well as perform large-scale aggregation, comparison, filtering, and other analysis\nof this information across registrants, as compared to requiring a non-machine readable data\nlanguage such at HTML.2523 The Inline XBRL requirement will also enable automatic\n2522 See Rules 405, 406, and 408 of Regulation S-T.\n2523 These considerations are generally consistent with objectives of the recently enacted Financial Data\nTransparency Act of 2022, which directs the establishment by the Commission and other financial\nregulators of data standards for collections of information, including with respect to periodic and current\nreports required to be filed or furnished under Exchange Act sections 13 and 15(d). Such data standards\nmust meet specified criteria relating to openness and machine-readability and promote interoperability of\n578\n\ncomparison of tagged disclosures against prior periods. If we were not to adopt the Inline XBRL\nrequirement as suggested by some commenters, some of these benefits would be diminished, in\nparticular the enhanced comparability of the disclosures required under the final rules. We are\nnot allowing for voluntary tagging, as suggested by one commenter, because to do so would\nlikely negatively impact the completeness of the data, thereby diminishing the usefulness of the\ninformation.\nWith respect to the commenter that suggested registrants should have the ability to select\na structured data language, we have concluded that leaving the particular structured data\nlanguage unspecified could lead to different issuers using different data languages for the same\ndisclosure, thus hindering the interoperability and usability of the data. We agree with\ncommenters that stated that the existing Inline XBRL data language is familiar to registrants and\ninvestors, and therefore continued use of this structured data language will ease registrants\u2019 cost\nof compliance and burdens on investors.\nWe acknowledge commenters that noted the importance of interoperability with\ninternational standards. The staff will keep this consideration in mind as it develops a draft\ntaxonomy for the final rules and will seek to incorporate elements from third-party taxonomies\nwhenever appropriate to do so. With respect to the commenter who called for the Commission\nto approve a taxonomy prior to compliance, consistent with the Commission\u2019s common practice,\na draft taxonomy will be made available for public comment, and the Commission will\nincorporate a final taxonomy into an updated version of EDGAR before the tagging requirements\ntake effect. We acknowledge commenters who expressed concerns about the potential for\nfinancial regulatory data across members of the Financial Stability Oversight Council. See James M.\nInhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023, P.L. 117-263, tit. LVIII, 136 Stat. 2395,\n3421-39 (2022).\n579"

In\norder to address these concerns and provide sufficient time for the adoption of a final taxonomy\nthat will take into consideration initial disclosures that will be provided in response to the final\nrules, we are delaying compliance with the structured data requirements for one year beyond\ninitial compliance with the disclosure requirements for LAF registrants, which have the earliest\ncompliance date regarding the final rules.2524 This approach should both help lessen any\ncompliance burden and improve data by reducing the need for extensive custom tagging.\nN. Treatment for Purposes of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act\n1. Proposed Rules\nThe Commission proposed to treat the proposed required climate-related disclosures as\n\u201cfiled\u201d and therefore subject to potential liability under Exchange Act section 18,2525 except for\ndisclosures furnished on Form 6-K.2526 The proposed filed climate-related disclosures would\nalso be subject to potential section 11 liability2527 if included in, or incorporated by reference\ninto, a Securities Act registration statement. This treatment would apply both to the disclosures\nin response to proposed subpart 1500 of Regulation S-K and to proposed Article 14 of\nRegulation S-X.\nThe Commission proposed that Form 6-K disclosures would not be treated as \u201cfiled\u201d\nbecause the form, by its own terms, states that \u201cinformation and documents furnished in this\nreport shall not be deemed to be \u2018filed\u2019 for the purposes of section 18 of the Act or otherwise\n2524 See infra at section II.O.3.\n2525 15 U.S.C. 78r.\n2526 See Proposing Release, section II.L.\n2527 15 U.S.C. 77k.\n580\n\nsubject to the liabilities of that section.\u201d2528 As the Commission explained when proposing the\nclimate-related disclosure rules,2529 the treatment of disclosures on Form 6-K as furnished is a\nlong-standing part of the foreign private issuer disclosure system.2530\n2. Comments\nCommenters expressed differing views on whether we should treat Commission-\nmandated climate-related disclosures as filed or furnished. Several commenters supported the\nproposed treatment of disclosures required by both proposed subpart 1500 of Regulation S-K and\nproposed Article 14 of Regulation S-X as filed.2531 One commenter stated that because climate-\nrelated disclosures will provide information that is important for investors in securities analysis\nand the management of investment risk, these disclosures should be treated the same as other\ncritical information filed under Regulations S-X and S-K that is material and necessary for\ninvestors\u2019 assessment of registrants\u2019 financial performance and future prospects.2532 Other\ncommenters stated that the treatment of climate-related disclosures as filed, which would allow\nliability under section 18 to attach to false or misleading statements, will communicate to\nregistrants the importance of these disclosures and deter them from greenwashing or otherwise\nmaking misleading statements.2533 Still other commenters stated that the proposed treatment of\nclimate-related disclosures as filed would help ensure that the disclosures are accurate and\n2528 Form 6-K, General Instruction B.\n2529 See Proposing Release at section II.L.\n2530 See Periodic Report of Foreign Issuer, Release No. 34-8069 (Apr. 28, 1967) [32 FR 7853 (May 30, 1967)].\nForm 6-K\u2019s treatment as furnished for purposes of section 18 has existed since the Commission adopted the\nform.\n2531 See, e.g., letters from Amer. for Fin.

Reform, Sunrise Project et al.\n2533 See letters from AGs of Cal. et al.; and CFA.\n581\n\nconsistent.2534 One such commenter stated that the treatment of climate-related disclosures as\nfiled could substitute for the proposed requirement to provide assurance for certain GHG\nemissions disclosures, which the commenter opposed.2535\nSeveral other commenters opposed the proposed treatment of climate-related disclosures\nas filed.2536 Some of these commenters stated that the Commission should treat climate-related\ndisclosures as furnished rather than filed because of the complexities and uncertainties involved\nin such disclosures, particularly regarding those pertaining to GHG emissions disclosures.2537 In\nthis regard one commenter stated that the \u201cevolving and uncertain nature of Scope 3\nmeasurement and tracking capabilities (and, for some smaller companies, the novelty of Scope 1\nand Scope 2 reporting) could make it difficult for [registrants] to reach the degree of certainty\nnecessary to assume the liability burden associated with reports filed with the\n[Commission].\u201d2538 Other commenters stated that the proposed treatment would deter registrants\nfrom providing expansive climate-related disclosures because of the potential liability under\nExchange Act section 18 and Securities Act section 11.2539\nSeveral commenters supported the proposed treatment of climate-related disclosures on a\nForm 6-K as furnished.2540 One commenter stated that it saw no reason to disrupt the well-\n2534 See, e.g., letters from Ceres; Franklin Templeton; PwC; and SKY Harbor.\n2535 See letter from SKY Harbor.\n2536 See, e.g., letters from Amer.

Herron.\n582\n\nestablished treatment of information provided on a Form 6-K.2541 Other commenters supported\nthe proposed Form 6-K treatment because they believed that all climate-related disclosures\nshould be treated as furnished.2542\n3. Final Rules\nAs proposed, the climate-related disclosures provided pursuant to the final rules will be\ntreated as filed. Climate-related disclosures will therefore be subject to potential liability\npursuant to Exchange Act section 18 and, if included or otherwise incorporated by reference into\na Securities Act registration statement, Securities Act section 11 as well. Treating climate-\nrelated disclosures as filed will help promote the accuracy and consistency of such disclosures.\nIn this regard, we believe climate-related disclosures should be subject to the same liability as\nother important business or financial information that the registrant includes in its registration\nstatements and periodic reports. While we acknowledge commenters\u2019 concerns regarding the\ncomplexities and evolving nature of climate data methodologies, particularly with regard to\nGHG emissions metrics,2543 the modifications we have made to the proposed rules should help to\nmitigate this concern. These modifications include: limiting the scope of the GHG emissions\ndisclosure requirement;2544 revising several provisions regarding the impacts of climate-related\nrisks on strategy, targets and goals, and climate-related metrics so that registrants will only be\nrequired to provide the disclosures in certain circumstances, such as when material to the\n2541 See letter from BHP.\n2542 See, e.g., letters from CEMEX; and J. Herron; see also letter from Nasdaq (stating that the Commission\nshould treat all climate-related disclosures as furnished while also stating that the Commission has \u201cnot\nexplained why it has discriminated between foreign and domestic companies in this regard\u201d).\n2543 See supra notes 2537 and 2538 and accompanying text.\n2544 See supra section II.H.3.\n583"

Compliance Date\n1. Proposed Rules\nThe Commission proposed phase in dates for complying with the proposed rules that\ndiffered based on a registrant\u2019s filing status or status as an SRC.2548 In proposing the different\ncompliance dates, the Commission recognized that many registrants may require time to\nestablish the necessary systems, controls, and procedures to comply with the proposed climate-\nrelated disclosure requirements. The Commission also indicated that it was appropriate to apply\nthe rules first to LAFs because many LAFs are already collecting and disclosing climate-related\ninformation, have already devoted resources to these efforts, and have some levels of controls\nand processes in place for such disclosure.2549 In addition, by providing AFs and NAFs with\nadditional time, and SRCs with the greatest amount of time, to prepare for complying with the\nproposed rules, the Commission sought to provide registrants, especially smaller registrants, with\nadditional time to prepare for the proposed climate-related disclosures.2550\n2545 See supra sections II.D., II.G.3, and II.H.3.\n2546 See supra section II.J.3.\n2547 See infra section II.O.3.\n2548 See Proposing Release, section II.M.\n2549 See id.\n2550 See id.\n584\n\nThe Commission summarized the proposed phase ins for compliance in the following\ntable, which was included in the Proposing Release.

The proposed compliance dates in the table\napplied to both annual reports and registration statements.\nCompliance Dates Under Proposed Rules\nRegistrant Type Disclosure Compliance Date Financial Statement\nMetrics Audit\nCompliance Date\nAll proposed disclosures, including GHG emissions metrics:\nGHG emissions metrics: Scope 1, Scope 3 and associated\nScope 2, and associated intensity intensity metric\nmetric, but excluding Scope 3.\nLAFs Fiscal year 2023 Fiscal year 2024\n(filed in 2024) (filed in 2025)\nSame as\nAFs and NAFs Fiscal year 2024 Fiscal year 2025\ndisclosure\n(filed in 2025) (filed in 2026)\ncompliance date\nSRCs Fiscal year 2025 Exempted\n(filed in 2026)\n2. Comments\nMany responsive commenters supported different compliance dates based on a\nregistrant\u2019s status as an LAF, AF, NAF, or SRC.2551 Some commenters supported the phase in\nschedule, as proposed.2552 One commenter stated that the proposed phase in periods would give\n2551 See, e.g., letters from Alphabet et al.; CEMEX; CAQ (recommending phase in schedule by type of\ndisclosure and filer status); Ceres; Franklin Templeton; J.

(recommending shortening the phase in period for all registrants\nother than LAFs by one year); CalSTRS (recommending setting the phase in periods to the earliest possible\ndates); and Ceres (recommending moving up disclosure proposed to be required for fiscal year 2025 by one\nyear).\n586\n\n3. Final Rules\nSimilar to the proposed rules, we are adopting delayed and staggered compliance dates\nfor the final rules that vary according to the filing status of the registrant.2561 We continue to\nbelieve that initially applying the disclosure requirements to LAFs is appropriate because many\nLAFs are already collecting and disclosing climate-related information,2562 and therefore will\nhave devoted resources to these efforts and have some levels of controls and processes in place\nfor such disclosure. In comparison, registrants that are not LAFs may need more time to develop\nthe systems, controls, and processes necessary to comply with the climate disclosure rules and\nmay face proportionately higher costs. Accordingly, we are providing such registrants additional\ntime to comply, with SRCs, EGCs, and NAFs receiving the longest phase in period. Although\nwe recognize that some SRCs and EGCs may technically be classified as AFs, such registrants\nmay face the same difficulties as other SRCs and EGCs in complying with the final rules, and\naccordingly, the extended compliance date applies to them based on their status as SRCs or\nEGCs.\nTo address the concerns of many commenters that the proposed compliance schedule was\ntoo challenging even for LAFs to meet, we are providing an extended and phased in compliance\nperiod for each type of registrant and for certain types of disclosures. For example, we are\nproviding a further phased in compliance date for registrants that may be required to disclose\ntheir Scopes 1 and 2 emissions that differs from the proposed compliance schedule, which would\nhave required registrants to provide those emissions disclosures by the same deadline as for the\n2561 For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding the fact that we generally use the term \u201cregistrant\u201d in this\nsection, the compliance dates discussed herein also apply to the information required to be provided\npursuant to new General Instruction C.3 of Forms S-4 and F-4 with respect to a company being acquired.\n2562 See infra section IV.A.5. See also, e.g., letters from Amazon; Dell; and Microsoft.\n587\n\nother climate disclosures. This will help address the concern of commenters that additional time\nis required for registrants, including many LAFs, to enhance or implement new policies,\nprocesses, controls, and system solutions in order to provide the GHG emissions disclosures if\nrequired. We are also providing a further phased-in compliance date for the requirements to\nprovide quantitative and qualitative disclosures about material expenditures and material impacts\nto financial estimates and assumptions required by Item 1502(d)(2), Item 1502(e)(2), and Item\n1504(c)(2) until the fiscal year immediately following the fiscal year of the registrant\u2019s initial\ncompliance date for subpart 1500 disclosures based on its filer status, for the reasons discussed\nabove.2563\nThe following table summarizes the phased in compliance dates of the final rules, both\nfor subpart 1500 of Regulation S-K and Article 14 of Regulation S-X. The compliance dates in\nthe table apply to both annual reports and registration statements; in the case of registration\nstatements, compliance would be required beginning in any registration statement that is required\nto include financial information for the full fiscal year indicated in the table.\nCompliance Dates under the Final Rules1\nRegistrant Type Disclosure and Financial GHG Emissions/Assurance Electronic\nStatement Effects Audit Tagging\nAll Reg.

See Rule 405(b)(1)(i) of Regulation S-T.\n2563 See supra sections II.D.1.c, II.D.2.c, and II.G.3.a.\n588\n\nFor example, an LAF with a January 1 fiscal-year start and a December 31 fiscal year-\nend date will not be required to comply with the climate disclosure rules (other than those\npertaining to GHG emissions and those related to Item 1502(d)(2), Item 1502(e)(2), and Item\n1504(c)(2), if applicable) until its Form 10-K for fiscal year ended December 31, 2025, due in\nMarch 2026. If required to disclose its Scopes 1 and/or 2 emissions, such a filer will not be\nrequired to disclose those emissions until its Form 10-K for fiscal year ended December 31,\n2026, due in March 2027, or in a registration statement that is required to include financial\ninformation for fiscal year 2026. Such emissions disclosures would not be subject to the\nrequirement to obtain limited assurance until its Form 10-K for fiscal year ended December 31,\n2029, due in March 2030, or in a registration statement that is required to include financial\ninformation for fiscal year 2029. The registrant would be required to obtain reasonable\nassurance over such emissions disclosure beginning with its Form 10-K for fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2033, due in March 2034, or in a registration statement that is required to include\nfinancial information for fiscal year 2033. If required to make disclosures pursuant to Item\n1502(d)(2), Item 1502(e)(2), or Item 1504(c)(2), such a filer will not be required to make such\ndisclosures until its Form 10-K for fiscal year ended December 31, 2026, due in March 2027, or\nin a registration statement that is required to include financial information for fiscal year 2026.\nAs another example, an AF that is not an SRC or EGC with a January 1 fiscal-year start\nand December 31 fiscal year-end date will not be required to comply with the climate disclosure\nrules (other than those pertaining to GHG emissions and those related to Item 1502(d)(2), Item\n1502(e)(2), and Item 1504(c)(2), if applicable) until its Form 10-K for the fiscal-year ending\nDecember 31, 2026, due in March 2027. If required to disclose its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions,\nsuch a filer will not be required to disclose those emissions until its Form 10-K for fiscal year\n589\n\nending December 31, 2028, due in March 2029, or in a registration statement that is required to\ninclude financial information for fiscal year 2028, and it would not be required to obtain limited\nassurance over such disclosure until its Form 10-K for fiscal year ending December 31, 2031,\ndue in March 2032, or in a registration statement that is required to include financial information\nfor fiscal year 2031. If required to make disclosures pursuant to Item 1502(d)(2), Item\n1502(e)(2), or Item 1504(c)(2), such a filer will not be required to make such disclosures until its\nForm 10-K for fiscal year ended December 31, 2027, due in March 2028, or in a registration\nstatement that is required to include financial information for fiscal year 2027.\nWe are adopting a separate compliance date for the structured data (electronic tagging)\nrequirements of the final rules that is one year following the earliest compliance date (which\napplies to LAFs) under the final rules.2564 We are adopting a later compliance date for the\nstructured data requirements to improve the quality of the structured data, as discussed above.2565\nAccordingly, LAFs will not be required to comply with the structured data requirements when\nfirst complying with the climate disclosure rules in subpart 1500 required in 2025 but will be\nrequired to do so when complying with the climate disclosure rules in subpart 1500 for fiscal\nyear 2026; tagging of disclosures provided in response to Item 1502(d)(2), Item 1502(e)(2), Item\n1504(c)(2), Item 1505, and Item 1506 will be required at the time of initial compliance with\nthese provisions. AFs (other than SRCS and EGCs) will be required to comply with the\nstructured data requirements when first complying with the relevant provisions of subpart 1500\nfor the fiscal year that begins in 2026. Similarly, SRCs, EGCs, and NAFs will be required to\n2564 We note that the final rules do not alter the requirements for registrants to tag their financial statement\ndisclosures in Inline XBRL. Accordingly, financial statement disclosures provided pursuant to new Article\n14 of Regulation S-X will be required to be tagged in accordance with those requirements at the time they\nare first required.

For instance, but without limitation, each of the following portions of the final rules\nserves distinct but related purposes and is capable of operating independently: (1) climate-related\nrisk disclosures, (2) targets and goals disclosures, (3) GHG emissions disclosures and assurance,\nand (4) Article 14 financial statement disclosures. Moreover, many of the required disclosure\nitems in the final rules operate independently in that not all registrants are required to provide\n591"

    "text": "each of the required disclosures, and some disclosures will only be provided to the extent\napplicable. For example, disclosures related to a registrant\u2019s use of transition plans, scenario\nanalysis, or internal carbon prices would depend upon a registrant\u2019s activities, if any, to mitigate\nor adapt to material climate-related risks. Similarly, governance disclosures would only be\nrequired to the extent that a registrant has information responsive to the disclosure\nrequirements. In addition, the GHG emissions disclosure requirements will apply only with\nrespect to LAFs and AFs (other than SRCs and EGCs). Thus, while the final rules are each\nintended to improve the overall consistency, comparability, and reliability of climate-related\ndisclosures as discussed throughout this release, the invalidity of any particular disclosure\nrequirement would not undermine the operability or usefulness of other aspects of the final\nrules.\nPursuant to the Congressional Review Act,2566 the Office of Information and Regulatory\nAffairs has designated these rules a \u201cmajor rule,\u201d as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).\nIV. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS\nWe are mindful of the economic effects that may result from the final rules, including the\nbenefits, costs, and the effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation.2567 This section\nanalyzes the expected economic effects of the final rules relative to the current baseline, which\nconsists of the regulatory framework of disclosure requirements in existence today, the current\n2566 5 U.S.C. 801 et seq.\n2567 Section 2(b) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. 77b(b), and section 3(f) of the Exchange Act, 17 U.S.C.\n78c(f), require the Commission, when engaging in rulemaking where it is required to consider or determine\nwhether an action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, to consider, in addition to the protection\nof investors, whether the action will promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation. Further,\nsection 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act, 17 U.S.C. 78w(a)(2), requires the Commission, when making rules\nunder the Exchange Act, to consider the impact that the rules would have on competition, and prohibits the\nCommission from adopting any rules that would impose a burden on competition not necessary or\nappropriate in furtherance of the Exchange Act.\n592\n\ndisclosure practices of registrants, and the use of such disclosures by investors and other market\nparticipants. Where possible, we have attempted to quantify these economic effects. In many\ncases, however, we are unable to reliably quantify the potential benefits and costs of the final\nrules because we lack information necessary to provide a reasonable estimate. For example,\nexisting empirical evidence does not allow us to reliably quantify how enhancements in climate-\nrelated disclosure may improve information processing by investors, or company monitoring of\nclimate-related risks. Where quantification of the economic effects of the final rules is not\npractical or possible, we provide a qualitative assessment of the effects.\nThe final rules will provide investors with more consistent, comparable, and reliable\ndisclosures with respect to registrants\u2019 climate-related risks that have materially impacted, or are\nreasonably likely to have a material impact on, the registrant\u2019s business strategy, results of\noperations, or financial condition, the governance and management of such risks, and the\nfinancial statement effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions, which will\nenable investors to make more informed investment and voting decisions.2568 Many investors\nhave expressed concern that the current landscape of primarily voluntary climate-related\ndisclosures is inadequate.2569 By requiring registrants to provide climate-related information in a\nmore standardized format in Commission filings, the final rules will mitigate the challenges that\ninvestors currently confront in obtaining consistent, comparable, and reliable information,\nassessing the nature and extent of the climate-related risks faced by registrants and their impact\non registrants\u2019 business operations and financial condition, and making comparisons across\nregistrants. Further, a mandatory disclosure regime will generally provide investors with access\n2568 See infra section IV.C.1.\n2569 See infra section IV.B.\n593\n\nto climate-related disclosures on a more timely and regular basis than a voluntary disclosure\nregime.2570 As a result, the final rules will reduce information asymmetry between investors and\nregistrants, which can reduce investors\u2019 uncertainty about estimated future cash flows. This\neffect contributes to a lowering of the risk premium that investors demand and therefore\nregistrants\u2019 cost of capital. The final rules will also reduce information asymmetry among\ninvestors by narrowing the informational gap between informed and uninformed traders, which\ncan reduce adverse selection problems and improve stock liquidity.2571 Further, by enabling\nclimate-related information to be more fully incorporated into securities prices, the final rules\nwill allow climate-related investment risks to be borne by those investors who are most willing\nand able to bear them. Taken together, the final rules are expected to promote investor\nprotection, the efficient allocation of capital, and, for some registrants, capital formation.2572\nWe recognize that the final rules will impose additional costs on registrants, investors,\nand other parties. Registrants will face increased compliance burdens, with the extent of these\nburdens varying based on a registrant\u2019s filer status, existing climate-related disclosure practices\n(if any), and other characteristics. For example, additional compliance burdens could be\n2570 As industry observers have noted, many companies do not disclose their climate and other sustainability\ndata until more than 12 months after the end of their fiscal year. See, e.g., Corporate Knights, Measuring\nSustainability Disclosure (2019), available at https://www.corporateknights.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2021/08/CK_StockExchangeRanking_2020.pdf. See letter from Morningstar (stating that\n\u201cCurrently, a lack of clear disclosure standards for the timing of \u2018sustainability reports,\u2019 which is the\nprimary source for emissions data, greatly hinders investor knowledge. For example, some registrants\nreleased 2021 reports\u2014detailing 2020 data\u2014as late as November 2021.\u201d); see also letters from\nMiller/Howard (stating that requiring disclosure in filings with the Commission will provide users with\nconfidence that they are receiving the \u201cmost recent\u201d climate-related information); and Calvert (stating that\n\u201c57% of 2,207 companies disclosed their Scope 1 and 2 emissions with a one or two year delay.\u201d).\nFurthermore, a voluntary regime may allow registrants to provide disclosures at irregular or multi-year\nintervals. In contrast, the final rules will generally require disclosures on an annual basis, which will allow\ninvestors to make better comparisons across time.\n2571 See Corporate Knights, supra note 2570.\n2572 See infra section IV.D.\n594\n\nsignificant for registrants that are not already collecting climate-related information and\nproviding climate-related disclosures. In other cases, the compliance burden could be more\nmodest, such as for registrants that are already collecting climate-related information and\nproviding information similar to what is required by the rules we are adopting. Additionally, the\nrequirements will pose a comparatively smaller compliance burden for those registrants that do\nnot have material climate-related risks. Other potential costs for registrants include increased\nlitigation risk and the potential disclosure of proprietary information about a registrant\u2019s\noperations, business, and/or production processes.2573 Beyond registrants, certain third parties,\nsuch as market participants, customers, and suppliers, could face reduced demand for their\nservices or higher prices for their inputs as a result of the final rules\u2019 required disclosures.\nA. Baseline and Affected Parties\nThe baseline against which the costs, benefits, and the effects on efficiency, competition,\nand capital formation of the final rules are measured consists of current requirements for climate-\nrelated disclosures and current market practice as it relates to such disclosures. The economic\nanalysis considers existing regulatory requirements, including recently adopted rules, as part of\nits economic baseline against which the benefits and costs of the final rules are measured.2574\n2573 See infra section IV.C.2.\n2574 See, e.g., Nasdaq v. SEC, 34 F.4th 1105, 1111-15 (D.C. Cir. 2022). This approach also follows\nCommission staff guidance on economic analysis for rulemaking. See SEC Staff, Current Guidance on\nEconomic Analysis in SEC Rulemaking (Mar. 16, 2012), available at\nhttps://www.sec.gov/divisions/riskfin/rsfi_guidance_econ_analy_secrulemaking.pdf (\u201cSEC Guidance on\nEconomic Analysis (2012)\u201d) (\u201cThe economic consequences of proposed rules (potential costs and benefits\nincluding effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation) should be measured against a baseline,\nwhich is the best assessment of how the world would look in the absence of the proposed action.\u201d); see id.\n(\u201cThe baseline includes both the economic attributes of the relevant market and the existing regulatory\nstructure.\u201d). The best assessment of how the world would look in the absence of the proposed or final\naction typically does not include recently proposed actions, because that would improperly assume the\nadoption of those proposed actions.\n595\n\nOne commenter stated that our analysis should account for the \u201c[s]taggering aggregate\ncosts and unprecedented operational challenges\u201d of recently proposed rules in three categories,\nincluding \u201c[c]orporate governance.\u201d2575 Another commenter identified two specific rules with\nwhich these final amendments could \u201cinteract in obvious or non-obvious ways that raise costs for\nbusinesses.\u201d2576 Implementation of one of these, adopted in the Cybersecurity Disclosures\nAdopting Release,2577 could involve the same staff and resources as implementation of the final\nclimate disclosure rules. However, we expect minimal overlap in the implementation periods of\nthe two rules because the only remaining compliance dates for the rules adopted in the\nCybersecurity Disclosures Adopting Release are for cybersecurity incident disclosure by smaller\nreporting companies by June 15, 2024, structured data requirements for Form 8-K and Form 6-K\ndisclosures by December 18, 2024, and structured data requirements for Item 106 of Regulation\nS-K and Item 16K of Form 20-F disclosures beginning with annual reports for fiscal years\nending on or after December 15, 2024. By contrast, the earliest compliance date for these final\nrules covers activities occurring in fiscal year 2025.\n2575 See letter from Member of the U.S. House of Representatives Patrick McHenry and 28 other House\nMembers (Sept. 26, 2023). Although the commenter did not identify specific rules that should be\nconsidered as part of this analysis, we considered the \u201ccorporate governance\u201d category noted by the\ncommenter (because the final rules include disclosure provisions related to governance of climate-related\nrisks) and identified Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure,\nsupra note 2486 (\u201cCybersecurity Disclosures Adopting Release\u201d) as a rule with potentially overlapping\nimplementation costs (discussed infra note 2577 and accompanying text).\n2576 See Overdahl exhibit to letter from Chamber (citing Mandel and Carew (2013)). In addition to the\nCybersecurity Disclosures Adopting Release, discussed infra, this commenter identified Share Repurchase\nDisclosure Modernization, Release Nos. 34-97424, IC-34906 (May 3, 2023) [88 FR 36002 (June 1, 2023)].\nThat rule was vacated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in December 2023. See Chamber\nof Com. of the U.S. v. SEC, 88 F.4th 1115 (Dec. 19, 2023).\n2577 See Cybersecurity Disclosures Adopting Release. The Cybersecurity Disclosures Adopting Release\nrequires current disclosure about material cybersecurity incidents, and periodic disclosures about a\nregistrant\u2019s processes to assess, identify, and manage material cybersecurity risks, management\u2019s role in\nassessing and managing material cybersecurity risks, and the board of directors\u2019 oversight of cybersecurity\nrisks. For a full discussion of compliance dates for these amendments, see id. at section II.I.\n596\n\nThis section describes the current regulatory and economic landscape with respect to\nclimate-related disclosures. It discusses the parties likely to be affected by the final rules, current\ntrends in registrants\u2019 voluntary reporting on climate risks, related assurance practices, and\nexisting mandatory disclosure rules under state and other Federal laws as well as from other\njurisdictions in which registrants may operate.\n1. Affected Parties\nThe disclosure requirements being adopted in this release will apply to Securities Act and\nExchange Act registration statements as well as Exchange Act annual and quarterly reports.\nThus, the parties that are likely to be affected by the final rules include: registrants subject to the\ndisclosure requirements imposed by these forms, as detailed below; consumers of the climate-\nrelated risk information, such as investors, analysts, and other market participants; and third-\nparty service providers who may collect and process this information, including assurance\nproviders and ratings providers.\nThe final rules will affect both domestic registrants and foreign private issuers, but will\nnot apply to Canadian registrants that use the MJDS and file their Exchange Act registration\nstatements and annual reports on Form 40-F.2578 We estimate that during calendar year 2022,\n2578 The number of domestic registrants and foreign private issuers affected by the final rules is estimated as the\nnumber of companies, identified by Central Index Key (\u201cCIK\u201d), that filed a unique Form 10-K or Form 20-\nF during calendar year 2022, excluding asset-backed securities issuers. For the purposes of this economic\nanalysis, these estimates do not include registrants that did not file a unique annual report. This approach\navoids including entities whose reporting obligation would be satisfied by a parent or other company, such\nas co-issuers of debt securities or guarantors, or who otherwise have a suspended reporting obligation. The\nestimates for the percentages of SRCs, EGCs, AFs, LAFs, and NAFs are based on data obtained by\nCommission staff using a computer program that analyzes SEC filings, with supplemental data from Ives\nGroup Audit Analytics and manual review of filings by Commission staff. Because this manual review\ntakes a substantial amount of time, the Commission staff performs this process at the end of each calendar\nyear rather than at the end of each quarter. Data for the 2023 filings is not yet available and fully reviewed,\nso the release includes 2022 numbers. Additionally, there are no 2023 updates for several sections of the\nbaseline (such as those that rely on data or reports from third parties that have not completed their reviews\nof 2023), so the release includes 2022 data to provide for comparability across the release.\n597\n\nexcluding registered investment companies, there were approximately 6,870 registrants that filed\non domestic forms,2579 and approximately 920 foreign private issuers that filed on Form 20-F.\nAmong domestic registrants, approximately 34 percent were LAFs, 10 percent were AFs, and 56\npercent were NAFs. In addition, we estimate that approximately 57 percent of domestic\nregistrants and 37 percent of foreign private issuers were either SRCs, EGCs, or both.\nThe final rules will require disclosures in registered offerings, except with respect to\nbusiness combination transactions involving a company not subject to the reporting requirements\nof Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. In many cases, registrants will be able to meet\nthese requirements by incorporating by reference from their periodic reports. Registrants that\nhave not previously filed periodic reports, such as companies conducting IPOs, will not have\npreviously filed such reports to incorporate by reference. In 2022, there were approximately 390\nsuch companies that conducted registered offerings on Form S-1 or F-1.2580\n2. Current Commission Disclosure Requirements\nAs discussed above and in the Proposing Release, existing disclosure requirements may,\ndepending on circumstance, require the disclosure of climate-related risk.2581 The 2010\n2579 This number includes approximately 50 foreign private issuers that filed on domestic forms in 2022,\napproximately 120 BDCs, and 300 REITs.\n2580 This estimate was calculated by searching EDGAR for all registrants who filed a Form S-1 or F-1 in the\nyear 2022. If multiple registration statements were filed in 2022 by the same registrant, the earliest was\nused. This list of registrants was then compared to a list of periodic reports (Forms 10-K, 10-Q, 20-F, 8-K)\nin EDGAR dating back to 2015. Approximately 390 registrants filed registration statements in 2022 that\nhad not previously filed a Form 10-K, 10-Q, 20-F, or 8-K. Of those, approximately 180 did not\nsubsequently file a Form 10-K, 10-Q, 20-F, or 8-K in 2022 or 2023, for example by operation of 17 CFR\n240.12h-5 or 12h-7, indicating that they may incur lower or no cost of ongoing compliance because they\nare exempt from ongoing Exchange Act reporting obligations.\n2581 See discussion supra section I.A; Proposing Release sections I.A, IV.A.2; see also supra section II.B. for\ndiscussion of the historical evolution of Commission rules requiring registrant disclosure. The Commission\nconsiders the current disclosure of climate risk-related information as part of the baseline against which the\nbenefits and costs of the final rules are measured. We disagree with the commenter who said that the\nbaseline discussion in the Proposing Release was \u201cin effect suggesting that anything climate-related should\n598\n\nGuidance describes how the Commission\u2019s existing disclosure requirements can encompass\nclimate-related risk.2582 The 2010 Guidance emphasized that certain existing disclosure\nrequirements in Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X may require disclosure related to climate\nchange. With respect to the most pertinent non-financial statement disclosure rules, the\nCommission noted that: Item 101 (Description of Business) expressly requires disclosure\nregarding certain costs of compliance with environmental laws;2583 Item 103 (Legal Proceedings)\nrequires disclosure regarding any material pending legal proceeding to which a registrant or any\nof its subsidiaries is a party; Item 105 (Risk Factors) requires disclosure regarding the most\nsignificant factors that would make an investment in the registrant speculative;2584 and Item 303\n(MD&A) of Regulation S-K requires material historical and prospective narrative disclosure\nenabling investors to assess the financial condition and results of operations of a registrant.2585\nbe presumed to be material.\u201d (Overdahl exhibit to letter from Chamber). The baseline includes both the\nrequired disclosure of material information under Commission regulation, as well as requirements under\nother laws that may apply to registrants, and current market practices which may include voluntary\ndisclosures. See also section IV.F.1. discussing the benefits and costs of a principles-based approach.\n2582 For an overview of how climate change issues may be required to be disclosed under existing rules,\nprimarily Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X, see 2010 Guidance, section III.\n2583 Item 101 of Regulation S-K was amended in 2019. See Release No. 33-10618. When the 2010 Guidance\nwas issued, Item 101(c)(1)(xii) required disclosure \u201cas to the material effects that compliance with Federal,\nstate and local provisions which have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the\nenvironment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, may have upon the capital\nexpenditures, earnings and competitive position of the registrant and its subsidiaries. The registrant shall\ndisclose any material estimated capital expenditures for environmental control facilities for the remainder\nof its current fiscal year and its succeeding fiscal year and for such further periods as the registrant may\ndeem material.\u201d\n2584 Risk Factors disclosure was required by Item 503(c) of Regulation S-K at the time of the 2010 Guidance.\nIt was moved to Item 105 of Regulation S-K in 2019. See Release No. 33-10618.\n2585 The 2010 Guidance also discusses corollary provisions applicable to foreign private issuers not filing on\ndomestic forms and states that, in addition to the Regulation S-K items discussed therein, registrants must\nalso consider any financial statement implications of climate-related matters in accordance with applicable\naccounting standards, including FASB ASC Topic 450, Contingencies, and FASB ASC Topic 275, Risks\nand Uncertainties. Finally, the 2010 Guidance noted the applicability of Securities Act Rule 408 and\nExchange Act Rule 12b-20, which require a registrant to disclose, in addition to the information expressly\nrequired by Commission regulation, \u201csuch further material information, if any, as may be necessary to\nmake the required statements, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.\u201d\n599\n\nWhile these provisions elicit some decision-useful climate-related disclosure,2586 they have not\nresulted in consistent and comparable information about the actual and potential material impacts\nof climate-related risks on a registrant\u2019s business or financial condition, which many investors\nhave increasingly stated that they need in order to make informed investment and voting\ndecisions.2587\n3. Existing State and Other Federal Laws\nExisting state and other Federal laws require certain climate-related disclosures or\nreporting. For instance, within the insurance industry there are requirements for mandatory\nclimate risk disclosure for any domestic insurers that write more than $100 million in annual net\nwritten premium.2588 As of 2022, 14 states2589 and the District of Columbia require these\ndomestic insurers to disclose their climate-related risk assessment and strategy via the NAIC\nClimate Risk Disclosure Survey, which the NAIC revised in 2022 to align with the TCFD\nframework.2590 Survey question topics include climate risk governance, climate risk\nmanagement, and modeling. For reporting year 2021, 62 registrants provided climate risk\n2586 See, e.g., Jeong-Bon Kim, Chong Wang & Feng Wu, The Real Effects of Risk Disclosures: Evidence from\nClimate Change Reporting in 10-Ks, 28 Rev. Acct. Stud. 2271 (2023) (finding that the 2010 Guidance\nresulted in a large increase in the number of firms providing climate-related disclosures).\n2587 See supra section I.A.\n2588 \u201cNet written premium\u201d is defined as the premiums written by an insurance company, minus premiums paid\nto reinsurance companies, plus any reinsurance assumed.\n2589 The 14 states are California, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New\nMexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. Colorado enacted\nlegislation requiring insurers to participate beginning in 2024. Co. Rev. Stat. 10-3-244 (enacted May 11,\n2023).\n2590 NAIC News Release, U.S. Insurance Commissioners Endorse Internationally Recognized Climate Risk\nDisclosure Standard for Insurance Companies (Apr. 8, 2022), available at\nhttps://content.naic.org/article/us-insurance-commissioners-endorse-internationally-recognized-climate-\nrisk-disclosure-standard; NAIC, Redesigned State Climate Risk Disclosure Survey (adopted Apr. 6, 2022),\navailable at https://www.insurance.ca.gov/0250-insurers/0300-insurers/0100-\napplications/ClimateSurvey/upload/2022RevisedStateClimateRiskSurvey.pdf.\n600\n\ndisclosures in response to the NAIC survey.2591 For reporting year 2022, insurers were allowed\nto submit a completed TCFD report or a survey response: 96 registrants provided either a TCFD\nreport or a survey response.2592\nFederal and state reporting requirements related to GHG emissions also exist. At the\nFederal level, the GHGRP requires that each facility that directly emits more than 25,000 metric\ntons of CO e per year report these direct emissions to the EPA.2593 Additionally, facilities that\n2\nsupply certain products that would result in over 25,000 metric tons of CO e per year if those\n2\nproducts were released, combusted, or oxidized must similarly report these \u201csupplied\u201d emissions\nto the EPA.2594 The resulting emissions data are then made public through the EPA\u2019s website.\nThe EPA estimates that the reporting required under the GHGRP covers 85 to 90 percent of all\n2591 This estimate is based on 20-F and 10-K filings in calendar year 2021 and 2021 NAIC survey results\navailable at https://interactive.web.insurance.ca.gov/apex_extprd/f?p=201:1 (last visited Jan. 16, 2024).\nSee supra note 2578 for more information on how the Commission staff estimated the number of\nregistrants.\n2592 This estimate is based on 20-F and 10-K filings in calendar year 2022, and 2022 NAIC survey results,\navailable at https://interactive.web.insurance.ca.gov/apex_extprd/f?p=201:1 (last visited Jan. 16, 2024).\n2593 See 40 CFR Part 98 (2022); see also EPA Fact Sheet. The EPA\u2019s emissions data does not include\nemissions from agriculture, land use, or direct emissions from sources that have annual emissions of less\nthan 25,000 metric tons of CO2e per year. See also letter from EPA (describing differences between the\nGHGRP and the SEC\u2019s proposed rule and noting the \u201cClean Air Act authority for reporting and the purpose\nof the GHGRP are distinct from those of the SEC\u2019s proposed rule.\u201d).\n2594 See EPA Fact Sheet; see also EPA, Learn About the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP),\navailable at https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/learn-about-greenhouse-gas-reporting-program-ghgrp\n(Updated June 20, 2023). According to the EPA, \u201cdirect emitters\u201d are facilities that combust fuels or\notherwise put GHGs into the atmosphere directly from their facility. See EPA, Greenhouse Gas Search\nUser Guide, available at https://www.epa.gov/enviro/greenhouse-gas-search-user-guide (Updated Jan. 17,\n2024). An example of a direct emitter is a power plant that burns coal or natural gas and emits CO directly\n2\ninto the atmosphere. Id. \u201cSuppliers\u201d are those entities that supply products into the economy which if\ncombusted, released, or oxidized emit GHGs into the atmosphere. Id. An example of a supplier is a\ngasoline importer or distributer, which sells gasoline in the U.S. that is burned in cars throughout the\ncountry. Id. While the GHGRP does not represent the total GHG emissions in the U.S., it is the only\ndataset containing facility-level data for large sources of direct emissions, thus including the majority of\nU.S. GHG emissions. See EPA, 2022 GHGRP Overview Report, available at\nhttps://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2023-10/ghgrp-2022-overview-profile.pdf. The EPA\nestimates that the GHGRP data reported by direct emitters covers about half of all U.S. emissions. Id.\nWhen including the greenhouse gas information reported by suppliers to the GHGRP, emissions coverage\nreaches approximately 85-90% of U.S. GHG emissions. Id.\n601\n\nGHG emissions from over 8,000 facilities in the United States,2595 and we estimate that\napproximately 365 registrants had an ownership stake in facilities that reported to the GHGRP in\n2022.2596 Gases that must be reported under the GHGRP include all those referenced by the\nGHG Protocol, which are also included within these final rules\u2019 definition of \u201cgreenhouse\ngases.\u201d2597\nIn light of the existence of the GHGRP, some commenters questioned the need for the\nproposed rules.2598 One commenter stated \u201c[t]he natural question is why the SEC feels\ncompelled to require its own GHG emissions disclosures when the EPA already has a public\nreporting program that covers 85 to 90 percent of all GHG emissions from over 8,000 facilities\nin the United States.\u201d2599 While we acknowledge that the GHGRP and the final rules both\naddress reporting of GHGs, there are distinct and significant differences between both the goals\nand requirements of the GHGRP and the final rules. As the EPA noted in its comment letter:\n\u201c[T]he GHGRP\u2026informs the development of greenhouse gas policies and programs under the\nClean Air Act, and serves as an important tool for the Agency and the public to understand\n2595 See EPA Fact Sheet.\n2596 This estimate is based on parent company data provided by the EPA (GHGRP Reported Data (2022), supra\nnote 2594), as well as registrant data gathered by Commission staff from Commission filings. Parent\ncompanies from the GHGRP reporting data were matched to registrants based on company name using\nLevenshtein Distance, as well as the reported city and state of the parent company. Matches were then\nmanually reviewed by Commission staff.\n2597 The EPA also requires reporting on some gases (e.g., fluorinated ethers, perfluoropolyether) that are\nconsidered optional under the GHG Protocol and that are not included within this final rules\u2019 definition of\n\u201cgreenhouse gases.\u201d\n2598 See letter from Andrew N. Vollmer (May 9, 2022); see also letters from D. Burton; Heritage Fdn. (\u201cThe\nvery limited increase in actual information that will be achieved by the proposed rule will make virtually no\ndifference. And, if it is thought that it will, by far the most efficient and effective means of increasing the\ninformation available would be to amend the EPA rules\u201d); and ConocoPhillips (\u201cWe believe GHG\ndisclosure regimes established by the EPA and regulators in other jurisdictions with broad existing GHG\nemissions coverage should form the basis of GHG emissions disclosure and do not believe additional and\nduplicative Scope 1 and 2 emissions disclosures will be useful or material to investors in many instances.\u201d).\n2599 See letter from Andrew N. Vollmer (May 9, 2022).\n602\n\ngreenhouse gas emissions from facilities covered by the GHGRP nationwide. This is distinct\nfrom the purposes of the SEC\u2019s Proposed Rules, which are intended to enhance and standardize\nclimate-related disclosures to address investor needs and help issuers more efficiently and\neffectively disclose climate-related risks, benefitting both investors and issuers.\u201d2600 In addition\nto the difference in goals, there are several significant differences in the requirements between\nthe GHGRP and the final rules. First, the entities required to report under the EPA regime may\ndiffer from the entities required to report under the final rules.2601 Second, the EPA requires\nemissions reporting only for U.S. facilities, while the final rules are not limited to U.S. facilities.\nThird, the EPA emissions data do not allow a precise disaggregation across the different scopes\nof emissions for a given registrant. In particular, the EPA requires reporting of facility-level\ndirect emissions, which may be a subset of the relevant registrant\u2019s Scope 1 emissions. Finally,\nthe EPA does not require reporting of Scope 2 emissions.2602\nMany state laws also impose specific GHG emissions reporting requirements.2603 States\u2019\nrules vary with respect to reporting thresholds and emissions calculation methodologies, but\nmost tend to focus on direct emissions, with certain exceptions. For example, in New York, any\nowner or operator of a facility that is a \u201cmajor source\u201d must report its annual actual emissions of\n2600 See letter from EPA.\n2601 The EPA requirements apply to facility owners and operators, and suppliers, while these final rules apply to\nregistrants.\n2602 \u201cThe GHGRP does not include emissions from\u2026reporting of data on electricity purchases or indirect\nemissions from energy consumption, which falls under Scope 2 emissions.\u201d (footnote omitted).

See supra note 156. These regulations are expected to provide further details regarding the law\u2019s\ncompliance requirements, including the content of the disclosure, the methodology for calculating\nemissions that are required to be disclosed and what qualifies as \u201cdoing business\u201d in California. The\nrequirements of the Climate-Related Financial Risk Act are self-effectuating, such that additional\nregulations are not required to implement the law\u2019s reporting requirements; however, the law requires the\nCARB to adopt regulations that authorize it to seek administrative penalties from covered entities for\nfailing to make the required reports publicly available or publishing inadequate or insufficient information\nin the report. See SB-253, supra note 156.\n2608 See SB-253, supra note 156.\n2609 See Brent W. Thompson, California\u2019s Climate Disclosure Requirements: An Overview of Senate Bills 253\nand 261, Ca.

We do not have readily accessible data that\ncould be used to reliably estimate the subset of these registrants doing business in California. One\ncommenter estimated that 73% of Fortune 1000 companies would need to comply with both California\nlaws. See letter from Amer. for Fin. Reform, Public Citizen and Sierra Club (Oct. 26, 2023) (using a list of\ncompanies registered with the California Secretary of State for their estimate, but describing in their\nmethodology discussion why that does not directly correspond to \u201cdoing business\u201d in the state).\n605\n\nAs a result of these Federal- and state-level climate-related disclosure and reporting\nrequirements, some registrants subject to the final rules may already have in place, or may be\ndeveloping, certain processes and systems to track and disclose aspects of their climate-related\nrisks.\n4. International Disclosure Requirements\nIssuers that are listed or operate in jurisdictions outside the United States may also be\nsubject to those jurisdictions\u2019 disclosure and reporting requirements. As discussed in section I.B.\nabove, many jurisdictions\u2019 current or proposed requirements for climate-risk disclosure are\naligned with the TCFD\u2019s framework for climate-related financial reporting.2616 Several\njurisdictions also have announced plans or support for adopting climate disclosure requirements\nthat are consistent with the TCFD recommendations, and some jurisdictions already require\nclimate-related disclosures aligned with the TCFD recommendations.2617 The UK, for example,\nhas TCFD-aligned disclosure requirements for certain issuers.2618 Insofar as Commission\n2616 See note 46 and accompanying text; see also TCFD, Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure:\n2023 Status Report, Table D1 (Oct. 2023), available at\nhttps://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/60/2023/09/2023-Status-Report.pdf (\u201cTCFD 2023 Status Report\u201d).\nFor more detail on the TCFD recommendations, see Proposing Release, section I.D; see also TCFD,\nOverview (Mar. 2021), available at\nhttps://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/60/2020/10/TCFD_Booklet_FNL_Digital_March-2020.pdf.\nConcurrent with the release of its 2023 status report, the TCFD fulfilled its remit and transferred to the\nISSB its responsibility for tracking company activities on climate-related disclosure. Fin. Stability Bd.,\nsupra note 151. As discussed infra, the TCFD recommendations are incorporated into the ISSB standards.\nAlthough the TCFD has disbanded, in this release we continue to refer to \u201cTCFD recommendations\u201d as\ndistinct from ISSB standards, both for clarity and because not all jurisdictions that implemented TCFD-\naligned disclosure requirements have implemented the broader and more recent ISSB standards.\n2617 See Proposing Release, section IV.A.4 (discussing disclosure requirements implemented, for example in\nthe United Kingdom, Japan, and New Zealand). Commission staff determined that in 2022, approximately\n1,961 Commission registrants traded in the U.K., 52 in Japan, and 2 in New Zealand; however, individual\nrequirements in each country determine whether these registrants are subject to the climate-related\ndisclosure laws of that country.

Subsequent stages will\nencompass other large EU-based companies,2627 and later, certain small to medium-sized\ncompanies and certain non-EU companies operating in the EU.2628 Finally, in the last stage of\nCSRD implementation, certain non-EU companies operating in the EU would report\nsustainability impacts to the EU,2629 but because the ESRS for that stage are not yet developed,\nwe cannot assess the extent to which disclosures made under this last stage would overlap with\neither the TCFD framework or these final rules.\nWe estimate that there are approximately 3,700 Commission registrants that are traded on\na European exchange; however, we understand that most of these companies do not trade on an\nEU-regulated market, in which case they may not be impacted by the initial stage of CSRD\n2625 See EFRAG, Draft European Sustainability Reporting Standards: Appendix IV \u2013 TCFD Recommendations\nand ESRS Reconciliation Table (Nov. 2022), available at\nhttps://www.efrag.org/Assets/Download?assetUrl=%2Fsites%2Fwebpublishing%2FsiteAssets%2F21%252\n0Appendix%2520IV%2520-%2520TCFD-EFRAG%2520Comparative%2520analysis%2520final.pdf.\n2626 European Commission, Questions and Answers on the Adoption of European Sustainability Reporting\nStandards (July 31, 2023), available at\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_23_4043 (\u201cCSRD Q&A\u201d). See also EFRAG,\nInteroperability Between ESRS and ISSB Standards, Discussion Paper 04-02 (Aug. 23, 2023) (\u201cCompanies\nthat are required to report in accordance with ESRS will to a very large extent report the same information\nas companies that use ISSB standards.\u201d).\n2627 For purposes of the CSRD, a \u201clarge\u201d company is one that meets at least two of the following criteria:\nbalance sheet total greater than \u20ac25 million; net turnover greater than \u20ac50 million; or more than 250\nemployees. See Directive (EU) 2023/2775 amending Directive 2013/34/EU as regards the adjustments of\nthe size criteria for micro, small, medium-sized and large undertakings or groups (Dec. 21, 2023), available\nat https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32023L2775.\n2628 See CSRD Q&A, supra note 2626.\n2629 See id.\n608\n\nimplementation.2630 We estimate that approximately 70 Commission registrants (fewer than 10\nof which are U.S.-based) are listed on EU-regulated markets and could therefore be subject to\nreporting under the initial set of ESRS in fiscal year 2024.2631 Additional registrants may have\nEU subsidiaries or operations that fall within the scope of the CSRD, including in later\ncompliance years. Although the number of Commission registrants subject to CSRD reporting in\n2024 may be relatively low, we expect that once the CSRD is fully implemented, it could apply\nto many of the 3,700 Commission registrants that trade on a European exchange, as well as other\nnon-EU companies, provided that they meet the required turnover and presence thresholds.2632\nThis assessment aligns with another estimate, which found that U.S. companies could make up\n31 percent of an estimated 10,000 U.S., Canadian, and British companies required to begin\ncomplying with the CSRD between 2025 and 2029.2633 However, the number of registrants\n2630 \u201cEuropean exchange\u201d refers to an exchange located in the EU. The first stage of CSRD implementation is\nspecific to companies trading on an \u201cEU-regulated market,\u201d where \u201cregulated market\u201d is a defined term\nunder EU securities law, distinct from an organized trading facility or multilateral trading facility. See\nDirective 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (May 15, 2014), available at\nhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32014L0065 (updated Mar. 23, 2023).\n2631 This analysis is based on listing status data from Refinitiv. We note that this figure may not reflect all\nregistrants that would be subject to the CSRD rules, as listing status is just one of the conditions for\nrequired disclosure under the EU rules. Fiscal year 2024 reporting is required of companies already subject\nto another EU reporting directive known as the Non-Financial Reporting Directive, including large U.S.\ncompanies with more than 500 employees and listed on an EU-regulated market. Among the\napproximately 70 registrants listed on EU-regulated markets, we are unable to determine how many are\n\u201clarge\u201d as defined in the CSRD, as many registrants do not provide geographic breakdowns of turnover or\nassets needed to identify turnover or assets attributable to the EU, so it is possible that the lower bound is\nfewer than 70 registrants. Even if not subject to CSRD reporting in fiscal year 2024, however, we\nanticipate that all or nearly all registrants listed on an EU-regulated exchange, and many not listed on such\nan exchange, will be required to report in subsequent compliance years as the CSRD phases in. We are not\naware of any official analysis from European authorities regarding the number of Commission-registered\nissuers which will be subject to CSRD reporting.\n2632 See generally CSRD Q&A, supra note 2626; Thibault Meynier, et al., EU Finalizes ESG Reporting Rules\nwith International Impacts, Harvard L.

As a result, some registrants subject to the final rules may already have in place, or\nmay be developing, processes and systems to track and disclose aspects of their climate-related\nrisks.\n5. Current Market Practices\nThis section describes current market practices with regard to climate-related disclosure,\nincluding disclosures made in Commission filings and in other contexts. This section then\ndescribes the use of third-party frameworks in current disclosures; the disclosure of climate-\nrelated targets, goals, and transition plans; and the use of third-party assurance.\nWe recognize that some aspects of the final rules may overlap with existing disclosure\nrequirements and practices. The incremental costs of the final rules to a specific registrant will\ndepend on the extent to which its disclosures resulting from the final rules overlap with\ndisclosures that would have occurred in the absence of the final rules, as discussed in further\ndetail below.2634\n2634 See section IV.C.3.c, \u201cFactors that Influence Direct Costs.\u201d The same point applies similarly to the more\ngeneral costs imposed by the final rules: those registrants that currently provide (or plan to provide)\nclimate-related disclosures irrespective of the final rules will incur lower incremental costs to the extent\nthat these disclosures overlap with the final rules\u2019 requirements.\n610\n\na. Climate-Related Disclosures in SEC Filings\nThe Commission staff reviewed 52,778 annual reports (Forms 10-K and 20-F) submitted\nfrom January 1, 2016, until December 31, 2022, to determine how many contain any of the\nfollowing keywords: \u201cclimate change,\u201d \u201cclimate risk,\u201d or \u201cglobal warming,\u201d collectively referred\nto as \u201cclimate-related keywords\u201d throughout this section.2635 The presence of any of the climate-\nrelated keywords in any part of the annual report is indicative of some form of climate-related\ndisclosure.2636 Table 1 shows the portion of climate-related keywords used in Form 10-\nKs and 20-Fs from 2021 through 2022.\nTable 1. Filings with Climate-Related Keywords by Form Type\nHas\nForm All Filings Percent\nKeyword\n10-K 4,521 12,846 35%\n20-F 662 1,721 38%\nTotal 5,183 14,567 36%\nThis table presents the analysis of annual filings submitted to the Commission between Jan.\n1, 2021, and Dec. 31, 2022. For each form type, the table indicates how many contain any\nof the climate-related keywords.\nFigure 1 shows that the percentage of Form 10-K and Form 20-F filings with climate-\nrelated keywords2637 has increased between 2016 and 2022. As reflected in Table 1, in more\nrecent filings (i.e., those submitted in calendar years 2021 and 2022) 36 percent of all annual\nreports contain some climate-related keywords, with a slightly greater proportion (38 percent)\n2635 We follow the approach used in the Proposing Release except we have excluded 40-F filers because they\nare not subject to the final rules.\n2636 One limitation of using this climate-related keyword search is that it is unable to discern the extent or\ndecision-usefulness of climate-related disclosures, nor can it determine specific sub-topics within climate-\nrelated disclosures. For these reasons, the analysis was supplemented by natural language processing\n(\u201cNLP\u201d) analysis, as described later in this section.\n2637 See supra note 2636.\n611\n\namong foreign private issuers filing on Form 20-F.2638 These figures are consistent with data\nfrom Bloomberg, which focuses on registrants listed on NYSE and NASDAQ, on ESG reporting.\nSpecifically, using this data, we find that 39 percent of registrants include a discussion of climate\nrelated risks in their MD&A section.2639\nFigure 1 shows that the percentage of Form 10-K and 20-F filings with climate-related\nkeywords2640 has been increasing between 2016 and 2022. We note that Table 1 reflects the\naverages of the last two years of the time-series shown in Figure 1.\n2638 Some foreign private issuers may elect to file their annual report on Form 10-K and would thus be\nclassified as \u201cdomestic filers\u201d in the following analysis.\n2639 Bloomberg reports \u201c[w]hether the Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) or its equivalent risk\nsection of registrant\u2019s annual report discusses business risks related to climate change.\u201d As with other\nsummary statistics presented in this release, these figures may not be representative of all Commission\nregistrants. For example, registrants that are not listed on NYSE or NASDAQ may be less likely to include\ndiscussions of climate related risks in their MD&A section.\n2640 See supra note 2636.\n612\n\nFigure 1. Percentage of Filings with Climate-related Keywords by Form Type\nThis figure presents the analysis of annual filings on Form 10-K and Form 20-F submitted to the Commission\nbetween Jan. 1, 2016, and Dec. 31, 2022. For each form type, the figure plots the percentage of filings containing\nclimate-related keywords.\n613\n\nTable 2 provides a breakdown of more recent filings by accelerated filer status. Among LAFs,\n68 percent provided climate-related keywords in 2022, while only 50 percent did so in 2021.\nDiscussions by AFs and NAFs also saw increases over the same period (from 40 to 49 percent\nand from 16 to 23 percent, respectively).\nTable 2.

For each industry, the table indicates how many contain any of the climate-related keywords.\n616\n\nFigure 2 provides a breakdown by industry of use of climate-related keywords.\nFigure 2. Percentage of Filings with Climate-related Keywords by Industry\nUsing the same sample of recent annual reports, Commission staff conducted additional\nanalysis using NLP, which can provide insight on the semantic meaning of individual sentences\n617\n\nwithin registrants\u2019 climate-related disclosures and classify them into topics (i.e., clusters).2641\nThe NLP analysis suggests that climate-related disclosures can be broadly organized into four\ntopics: business impact, emissions, international climate accords, and physical risks. The\nanalysis finds significant variation, both within the quantity and content, of climate-related\ndisclosures across industries, as shown in Figures 3 and 4.\nFigure 3 presents the intensity of disclosure for domestic annual report filings (Form 10-\nK). The intensity refers to sentences per registrant, which is calculated by taking the aggregate\nnumber of sentences in an industry and dividing it by the total number of registrants within the\nindustry (including those that do not include any climate-related keywords). Thus, the intensity\nrepresents a more comparable estimate across industries. Figure 3 shows that registrants in the\nfollowing industries have the highest intensity of disclosures: oil and gas, electric services, and\nmining. The majority of these disclosures addressed business impact, followed by emissions,\ninternational climate accords, and physical risks. Figure 4 presents the corresponding\ninformation for foreign annual report filings (Form 20-F). The foreign filings contain\nconsiderably higher intensity of climate-related keywords. For example, Form 10-K filers in the\noil and gas industry have approximately 12 sentences per filing containing climate-related\nkeywords while foreign filers in the same industry devote approximately 75 sentences per filing\ncontaining climate-related keywords. Overall, the analysis indicates that the majority of the\ndisclosure for both domestic and foreign filings is focused on transition risks, with comparatively\nfewer mentions of physical risk.\n2641 The specific NLP method used in this analysis is word embedding, which utilizes Google\u2019s publicly\navailable, pre-trained word vectors that are then applied to the text of climate-related disclosures within\nregulatory filings. While this NLP analysis can be used to identify the general topic and the extent of\ndisclosures, it is limited in its ability to discern the decision-usefulness of disclosures from investors\u2019\nperspective.\n618\n\nFigure 3. Clustered Intensity by Industry for Domestic Filings (Form 10-K)\nThis figure presents the analysis of Form 10-K annual filings submitted to the Commission between Jan. 1, 2021,\nand Dec. 31, 2022. NLP was used to analyze sentences contained within the annual filings and classify them into\nfour broad topics (i.e., clusters): business impact, emissions, international climate accords, and physical risks.\nIntensity refers to the average number of sentences per registrant, which is calculated by taking the aggregate\nnumber of relevant sentences in an industry and dividing it by the total number of registrants within the industry.\n619\n\nFigure 4. Clustered Intensity by Industry for Foreign Filings (Form 20-F)\nThis figure presents the analysis of Form 20-F annual reports submitted to the Commission between Jan. 1, 2021, and\nDec. 31, 2022. We exclude any Form 20-Fs that were not annual reports. NLP was used to analyze sentences\ncontained within the annual filings and classify them into four broad topics (i.e., clusters): business impact, emissions,\ninternational climate accords, and physical risks. Intensity refers to the average number of relevant sentences per\nregistrant, which is calculated by taking the aggregate number of sentences in an industry and dividing it by the total\nnumber of registrants within the industry.\n620\n\nThe Commission staff\u2019s findings are consistent with one academic study that looked at\nthe extent of climate-related disclosures by Commission registrants.2642 In this study, a review of\nForm 10-K filings from Russell 3000 companies over the last 12 years found that the majority of\nclimate-related disclosure is focused on transition risks,2643 consistent with the above\nCommission staff analysis that finds that annual filings contain more discussion on emissions\nand international climate accords relative to physical risks. This study further found that while\n35 percent of Russell 3000 Index companies provided climate-related information in 2009, this\nfigure grew to 60 percent in 2020.2644 The study also found that the extent of disclosure for a\ngiven report has increased.2645 In 2009, companies mentioned climate risks 8.4 times on average\nin their Form 10-K.2646 This figure grew to 19.1 times in 2020.2647\nThe Proposing Release included a similar analysis of climate-related disclosures in\nCommission filings using data from earlier years.2648 That analysis also found that filings by\nregistrants in the electric services and oil and gas industries have the most robust climate-related\ndiscussions.2649 In response to this finding, one commenter suggested that the current\n\u201cprinciples-based approach is working successfully, as these are industries where climate-related\n2642 See Parker Bolstad, Sadie Frank, Erick Gesick & David Victor, Flying Blind: What Do Investors Really\nKnow About Climate Change Risks in the U.S. Equity and Municipal Debt Markets (Hutchins Center\nWorking Paper 67, 2020) (\u201cHutchins Center Working Paper\u201d).\n2643 See id.\n2644 See id.

The Commission staff\u2019s analysis focuses on the incidence of climate-related\ndiscussion in annual reports (Forms 10-K and 20-F).2651 The fact that the incidence of\ndisclosures may be correlated with the likelihood that climate-related risks are material to a\nparticular company does not demonstrate that registrants are fully disclosing their material\nclimate-related risks to investors. For instance, registrants may strategically omit information\nthat could be perceived as negative or adverse,2652 and some studies point to the potential for\nsubstantial underreporting of material climate-related information within the current principles-\nbased reporting regime.2653\nIn addition, one commenter suggested the Commission examine analyst reports and\ninteractions involving analysts to assess \u201cthe significance of ESG factors relative to other factors\nfor determining the value of securities.\u201d2654 There is academic research that considers analyst\nreports; this literature has found that, while very few analyst reports traditionally discuss topics\nrelated to climate, climate-related disclosures can offer useful predictive signals about future\nfinancial performance for firms whose industries are most exposed to climate-related risk and\n2650 See Overdahl exhibit to letter from Chamber.\n2651 See also section IV.A.5 for an update of the analysis in the Proposing Release.\n2652 A recent analysis, for example, showed that absent mandatory requirements from regulators, voluntary\ndisclosures following third-party frameworks were generally of poor quality and that companies making\nthese disclosures cherry-picked to report primarily non-material climate risk information.

Additional Trends in Climate-Related Disclosures\nAs discussed below, a number of industry and advocacy groups have examined the scope\nof voluntary climate-related disclosures, and their findings are relevant to assess the economic\nimpact of the final rules.\ni. Prevalence and Scope of Climate-Related Disclosures\nAs discussed in the Proposing Release,2661 one organization, in collaboration with several\nother organizations, conducted a survey of a sample of 436 U.S. public companies across 17\nindustries that range from small to large in terms of market capitalization.2662 According to the\nsurvey, over half of the companies (52 percent) published a CSR, sustainability, or a similar\nreport, the contents of which commonly include information regarding climate-related risks. The\nmost frequently discussed topics in such reports were energy (74 percent), emissions (70\npercent), environmental policy (69 percent), water (59 percent), climate mitigation strategy (57\npercent), and supplier environmental policies (35 percent). Among the registrants that reported\nclimate-related information to the public, the majority disclosed such information via external\nreports or company websites rather than through regulatory filings. Similar to the Commission\nstaff\u2019s review, the survey found that about a third (34 percent) of the respondents disclosed\ninformation regarding \u201crisks related to climate change, greenhouse gas emissions, or energy\nsourcing\u201d in their Commission filings.2663 Among these companies, 82 percent disclosed such\n2661 See Proposing Release, section IV.A.5.b.\n2662 See Center for Capital Markets, 2021 Survey Report: Climate Change & ESG Reporting from the Public\nCompany Perspective, available at https://www.centerforcapitalmarkets.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2021/08/CCMC_ESG_Report_v4.pdf.

However, the most significant change was\namong companies in the bottom half of the Russell 1000 Index, where sustainability reporting\npercentage increased to 82 percent, up from 34 percent in 2018. The percentage of companies\nfrom each Global Industry Classification Standard (\u201cGICS\u201d) sector2667 that published a\nsustainability report in 2021 were: Communications (56 percent), Consumer Discretionary (81\npercent), Consumer Staples (91 percent), Energy (94 percent), Financials (85 percent), Health\nCare (69 percent), Industrials (89 percent), Information Technology (71 percent), Materials (95\npercent), Real Estate (90 percent), and Utilities (100 percent).\n2664 See id.\n2665 See G&A, Sustainability Reporting Trends, available at https://www.ga-institute.com/research/ga-research-\ndirectory/sustainability-reporting-trends; see also Proposing Release, section IV.A.5.b.\n2666 See G&A, 2023 Sustainability Reporting in Focus, available at https://www.ga-institute.com/research/ga-\nresearch-directory/sustainability-reporting-trends/2023-sustainability-reporting-in-focus.html; see also past\nreports, available at https://www.ga-institute.com/research/ga-research-directory/sustainability-reporting-\ntrends.html.\n2667 For more information on GICS sector categories, see MSCI, The Global Industry Classification Standard\n(GICS), available at https://www.msci.com/our-solutions/indexes/gics (last visited Feb. 28, 2024).\n625\n\nNotwithstanding these investor-led initiatives, disclosures currently vary considerably in\nterms of coverage, location, and presentation across companies,2668 making it difficult for\ninvestors to navigate through different information sources and filings to identify, compare, and\nanalyze climate-related information.2669 For example, one commenter submitted a survey\nreporting that institutional investors spend an average of $257,000 and $357,000 on \u201ccollecting\nclimate data related to assets\u201d and \u201cinternal climate-related investment analysis,\u201d\nrespectively.2670 An academic study similarly finds that \u201cthere exists considerable heterogeneity\nin what and how firms report about their CSR activities \u2026 The heterogeneity in reported CSR\ntopics makes it difficult for users to compare disclosures and to benchmark firms\u2019 underlying\nCSR performance.\u201d2671 Some studies and commenters have asserted that current disclosures are\n2668 See, e.g., TCFD Report, supra note 46, at 16; see also IOSCO Report, supra note 1089; GAO, Climate-\nRelated Risks (2018), available at https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-18-188.pdf (reporting that \u201cinvestors\nmay find it difficult to navigate through the filings to identify, compare, and analyze the climate-related\ndisclosures across filings\u201d); letter from Bloomberg.\n2669 See letters from Calvert (\u201cCalvert purchases third party vendor data to support our ability to assess\ncompanies on their ESG factors and that provide specific data related to climate change, where available.\nOften vendor information is estimated when a company has not disclosed information on its climate-related\nrisks.

GHG Emissions Reporting\nCommission staff also analyzed the number of registrants that recently reported Scope 1\nand 2 emissions data. In this analysis, Commission staff utilized a database that compiles\nemissions data (among other ESG-related information) from companies\u2019 annual filings,\nsustainability reports, or other public disclosures.2675 The number of registrants that are covered in\nthis database is 5,535, which comprises the matched sample. From this matched sample, about 20\n2672 See SASB, The State of Disclosure: An Analysis of the Effectiveness of Sustainability Disclosure in SEC\nFilings (2017), available at https://www.sasb.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/StateofDisclosure-Report-\nweb112717.pdf (reporting that about 50% of Commission registrants provide generic or boilerplate\nsustainability information in their regulatory filings); see also letter from The Institute for Policy Integrity\nat New York University School of Law, Environmental Defense Fund, and Professor Madison Condon\n(\u201cInst. Policy Integrity et al.\u201d) (\u201cExisting disclosure regulations and guidance have proved insufficient to\naddress this asymmetry. In a 2020 study of climate risk disclosures in 10-K filings, the Brookings\nInstitution concluded that though \u2018[d]isclosure has risen sharply,\u2019 \u2018[m]ore firms are disclosing more general\ninformation that is essentially of no utility to the marketplace.\u2019\u201d).\n2673 See supra note 2570; see also letter from Calvert (\u201cLast year, when evaluating disclosure rates of\ncompanies in our equities portfolios, we found 57% of 2,207 companies disclosed their Scope 1 and 2\nemissions with a one to two year delay . . .

The U.S. coverage broadly includes listed companies\nbelonging to the Russell 3000 Index. The emissions data used in this analysis was extracted from Refinitiv\non Feb 11, 2024.

These and other statistics are presented in Table 5.\nTable 5.

Commission staff used the Refinitiv ESG database. See supra note 2675.\n2. These statistics are based on SEC registrants filing annual reports in calendar year 2022. See supra note 2578. For\nLAF, AF, and NAF registrant counts, only those that are not SRCs or EGCs are included. We note that several non-\nSRC/EGC registrants did not disclose their filer status, thus the total registrant count in Table 5 is not the same as\nwhat is indicated in section IV.A.1.\n3. The matched sample consists of the number of registrants that are covered in the Refinitiv ESG database.\n4. Column (4) = (Column (3))/(Column (2)).\n5. Column (6) = (Column (5))/(Column (3)).\n6. Data collection of GHG emissions disclosure can lag by 18 months or longer. As a result, the number of disclosers\nfor FY 2022 may not be complete and thus understated.\n7. Column (8) = (Column (7))/(Column (3)).\n2676 These percentages may be understated to the extent that Refinitiv may not be able to fully track all\nemissions disclosures made by Commission registrants. Conversely, compared to the full sample of\nCommission registrants, these figures may be overstated given that smaller firms outside of Refinitiv\u2019s\ncoverage universe (i.e., those outside of the Russell 3000) are less likely to report emissions.\n628\n\nWe note that the number of registrants providing disclosure in fiscal year 2022 may be\nunderstated given that data collection of GHG emissions can lag by up to 18 months.2677 To\nestimate how this number could potentially increase upon the completion of data collection, we\nconsider the following assumption: for those registrants that disclosed only in fiscal year 2021\n(but not in fiscal year 2022), we assume that their fiscal year 2022 disclosures are\nforthcoming.2678 Within the matched sample, there are 263 LAFs that disclosed in fiscal year\n2021 but not in fiscal year 2022. The corresponding number for AFs is 17. If we assume that\nthese registrants subsequently provide their fiscal year 2022 disclosures, the fiscal year 2022\ndisclosure rate for LAFs would increase from 42% to 55%2679 and that of AFs would increase\nfrom 15% to 20%.2680 We recognize, however, that the above assumption may not hold true for\nall of these registrants.\nCommission staff also analyzed U.S. companies that voluntarily responded to CDP\u2019s\nquestionnaire and publicly disclosed their responses.2681 In 2022, 1,311 domestic companies\n2677 The Commission understands that data collection of GHG emissions for FY 2022 is ongoing. In addition,\nsome industry observers have noted that \u201cmany companies still take more than 12 months after their fiscal\nyear to disclose their sustainability data,\u201d see, e.g., Corporate Knights, supra note 2570; letter from\nMorningstar (\u201cCurrently, a lack of clear disclosure standards for the timing of \u2018sustainability reports,\u2019\nwhich is the primary source for emissions data, greatly hinders investor knowledge. For example, some\nregistrants released 2021 reports\u2014detailing 2020 data\u2014as late as November 2021.\u201d)\n2678 These registrants have demonstrated that they have Scope 1 and 2 emissions measurement and disclosure\nprocesses in place. It is therefore plausible that they have forthcoming disclosures for FY 2022 that is not\nyet in the dataset.\n2679 (870 + 263)/2059 = 55%.\n2680 (50+17)/334 = 20%.\n2681 This analysis is based on data provided to the Commission from CDP, available at\nhttps://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-10-22/s71022-206599-416182.xlsx. CDP operates a global disclosure\nsystem that enables companies, cities, states and regions to measure and manage their environmental risks,\nopportunities and impacts. Despite not being a framework like GRI, SASB and TCFD, CDP\u2019s\nquestionnaires gather both qualitative and quantitative information from across governance, strategy, risk,\nimpact and performance. To aid comparability and ensure comprehensiveness, CDP includes sector-\nspecific questions and data points. In 2018, CDP aligned its climate change questionnaire with the TCFD.\n629\n\nprovided responses to CDP\u2019s questionnaire. Approximately 610 of these were Commission\nregistrants,2682 suggesting that 10 percent of the approximately 5,860 domestic registrants that\nwill be subject to the final rules provided responses to CDP\u2019s questionnaire in 2022. The\nresponse rate was higher among companies with higher market capitalizations. For example,\nCDP lists 351 respondents as included in its S&P 500 sample, suggesting that approximately 70\npercent of S&P 500 companies provided responses. Of these 351 respondents, 95 percent\nprovided Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions data. In addition, a 2022 report examines Russell 1000\ncompanies and finds that 57% disclose Scope 1 and 2 emissions.2683\nc. Use of Third-Party Frameworks\nMultiple third-party reporting frameworks and data providers have emerged over the\nyears to facilitate and encourage the reporting of climate-related information by companies.2684\nDue to the voluntary nature of third-party frameworks, however, companies often disclose some\nCompanies\u2019 participation in the CDP questionnaire is voluntary. If a company decides to respond to the\nquestionnaire and disclose its information to the CDP, it then has the option to mark its response as either\n\u201cPublic\u201d or \u201cPrivate.\u201d Importantly, responses marked as \u201cPrivate\u201d are available only to the signatory\ninvestors of the CDP (non-signatory investors and the general public cannot access this information).\nResponses marked as \u201cPublic\u201d can be accessed by the general public at no cost. See CDP, available at\nhttps://www.cdp.net/en/info/about-us. In a meeting with CDP officials, the Commission staff was\ninformed that the number of public companies that respond to the CDP questionnaire but do not publicly\ndisclose their responses is negligible. See SEC Meeting Memorandum dated June 15, 2023, available at\nhttps://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-10-22/s71022-206619-416182.pdf.\n2682 This estimate is based on matching CDP survey respondents to registrants on ticker, company name, and\nindustry. Five-hundred seventy matches were made on ticker. Approximately 40 more matches were made\non company name using Levenshtein Distance. The matches were then manually reviewed by Commission\nstaff to ensure the industry description provided by CDP aligned with the SIC code assigned to the matched\nregistrant.\n2683 See Just Capital, The Current State of Environment Disclosure in Corporate America: Assessing What Data\nRussell 1000 Companies Publicly Share, available at https://justcapital.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2022/04/JUST-Capital_Environment-State-of-Disclosure-Report_2022.pdf.\n2684 The TCFD, the SASB, the GRI, the Principles for Responsible Investment, the PCAF, and the CDP (among\nothers), have all developed standards and systems that aim to help firms and investors identify, measure,\nand communicate climate-related information and incorporate that information into their business practices.\nMultiple frameworks have emerged, in part, because each seeks to provide different information or fulfill\ndifferent functions when it comes to disclosing information related to climate-related risks or other ESG\nfactors that may be important to investors.\n630\n\nbut not all components of those frameworks, and the components that are disclosed may not be\nthe same across companies,2685 resulting in reporting fragmentation.\nSome companies follow existing third-party reporting frameworks when developing\nclimate-related disclosures for Commission filings or to be included in CSR, sustainability, ESG,\nor similar reports. As described in the Proposing Release, for instance, one survey found that 59\npercent of respondents follow one or more such frameworks.2686 Among these respondents, 44\npercent used SASB, 31 percent used the Global Reporting Initiative GRI, 29 percent used the\nTCFD, and 24 percent used the CDP.2687 Broadly similar statistics on the usage of different\nreporting frameworks are also provided by other studies. For example, another report2688 found\nthat 78 percent of sustainability reports from Russell 1000 companies aligned with SASB\nreporting standards,2689 54 percent utilized GRI reporting standards,2690 50 percent aligned with\nthe TCFD recommendations,2691 and 53 percent responded to the CDP Climate Change\n2685 See Reiners et al., supra note 2653.\n2686 See supra note 2662; see also Proposing Release, section IV.A.5.\n2687 See Proposing Release at nn.768-770 and accompanying text.\n2688 See supra note 2666.\n2689 See id.

According to one report,2694 the GRI standards exhibit \u201cReasonable\u201d\nalignment with the TCFD, while the SASB standards generally exhibit \u201cModerate\u201d or\n\u201cReasonable\u201d alignment with the majority of the TCFD disclosure items. Additionally, the CDP\nClimate Change questionnaire fully incorporates the TCFD framework and thus exhibits full\nalignment.2695 Thus, companies that report following the GRI, SASB, or CDP frameworks are,\nto varying degrees, producing disclosures that are in line with the TCFD. However, because\neach framework takes different approaches (e.g., different intended audience and/or reporting\nchannel) and because certain differences exist in the scope and definitions of certain elements,\ninvestors may find it difficult to compare disclosures under each framework. One organization\n2692 See id. Thirty-two percent of companies in the smaller half of the Russell 1000 index (by market\ncapitalization) responded to the CDP Climate Change questionnaire. The corresponding statistic for\ncompanies in the larger half is 74%.\n2693 See White & Case and the Soc. Corp.

See supra note 2696.\nThe variety of disclosure frameworks in use, and their varying rates of overlap with the TCFD\ndisclosure elements, demonstrates the low rate of consistency and comparability among existing\nclimate disclosures.\nd. Climate-Related Targets, Goals, and Transition Plan Disclosures\nCarbon reduction targets or goals have become an increasing focus for both companies\nand countries.2697 For example, 195 parties, including the United States, the EU, and the UK,\nhave signed the Paris Climate Agreement as of December 2023.2698 The agreement aims to\nstrengthen the global response to climate change by keeping a rise in global temperatures to well\nbelow 2\u00ba Celsius above pre-industrial levels this century, as well as pursue efforts to limit the\ntemperature increase even further to 1.5\u00ba Celsius.2699 A 2022 report, which examined\napproximately 5,300 companies across the globe, found that over one-third of these companies\nannounced plans to curb their Scope 1 or Scope 2 emissions.2700 Of these 5,300 companies that\n2697 See, e.g., UNFCC COP28 Agreement, supra note 34; Press Release, United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change, Commitments to Net Zero Double in Less Than a Year, (Sept. 21, 2020),\navailable at https://unfccc.int/news/commitments-to-net-zero-double-in-less-than-a-year.\n2698 See United Nations, Multilateral Treaties Deposited with the Secretary General ch.

This represented 28% of major global companies (i.e., those listed on the\nS&P Global 1200 index) and 27% of major (i.e., those listed in the S&P 500 index) U.S. companies\npublicly disclosing these targets.

According to the CDP\u2019s Transition Plan report, \u201cNearly 20,000 organizations around the world\ndisclosed data through CDP in 2022, including more than 18,700 companies worth 50% of global market\ncapitalization, and over 1,100 cities, states and regions.\u201d\n635\n\npre-industrial levels.2708 Approximately 43 percent of these transition plans are publicly\navailable.2709\nCommission staff compared these figures to data related to targets and goals on the\nBloomberg ESG database, which is focused on registrants listed on NYSE and NASDAQ. The\nresults are reported in Table 7 below. These results are generally consistent with data from the\nsources discussed above.\n2708 See id.\n2709 See id.\n636\n\nTable 7.

Examples might include efforts to reduce GHG emissions, efforts to improve energy\nefficiency, efforts to derive energy from cleaner fuel sources, investment in product development to reduce\nemissions generated or energy consumed in the use of the company's products etc.\u201d\n2 Bloomberg defines this field as indicating: \u201cWhether the registrant has disclosed the implementation of any\ninitiative to reduce its emissions, such as GHGs, SOx, NOx, or other air pollutants in its annual report or CSR\nreport.\u201d\n3 Bloomberg defines this field as indicating: \u201cWhether the registrant has disclosed its ambition and engagement\nrelated to setting science-based GHG emissions reduction targets. Emissions targets are considered science-\nbased if they align with the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement to limit warming to well below 2 degrees\nCelsius above pre-industrial levels. That is, whether the company has explicitly disclosed that they have either\ncommitted to setting or have set science-based targets. This information is sourced from a company\u2019s CSR\nreport.\u201d\n4 Bloomberg defines this field as indicating: \u201cWhether the registrant has disclosed its ambition and engagement\nrelated to achieving Net Zero GHG emissions. Net Zero refers to a state in which GHG emissions released\ninto the atmosphere are balanced by removal of emissions from the atmosphere. This information is sourced\nfrom a company\u2019s CSR report.\u201d\nThe results suggest that smaller registrants (NAFs, EGCs, and SRCs) are much less likely\nto have developed climate-related targets and goals. For example, the portion of companies that\nhave \u201cNet Zero Plans\u201d is approximately 1 percent for EGCs and approximately 22 percent for\nnon-EGCs.\n637\n\ne. Third-Party Assurance of Climate-Related Disclosures\nAmong the companies that provide climate-related disclosures, a considerable portion\ninclude some form of third-party assurance of the accuracy of these disclosures. One report finds\nthat 40 percent of Russell 1000 Index companies, nearly all of which are LAFs, obtained third-\nparty assurance for their sustainability reports in 2022, up from 24 percent in 2019.2710 Among\nthe companies that obtained assurance, however, only three percent obtained assurance for the\nentire report, with 58 percent obtaining assurance only with respect to GHG emissions.\nRegarding the level of assurance, the overwhelming majority (92 percent) obtained limited\nassurance while only 5 percent obtained reasonable assurance. Regarding service providers, 17\npercent of companies received assurance from an accounting firm, 15 percent from small\nconsultancy/boutique firms, and 68 percent from engineering firms.2711 Because these statistics\nare limited to Russell 1000 Index companies, corresponding figures for the full sample of U.S.\nregistrants may differ depending on the extent to which the practice of obtaining third-party\nassurance is concentrated in large companies.2712 Indeed, based on Commission staff\u2019s analysis\n2710 See supra note 2666.\n2711 One study finds that assurance service providers that are not financial auditors are reported to be not\napplying the AICPA assurance standards. See Brandon Gipper, Samantha Ross & Shawn Shi, ESG\nAssurance in the United States (Aug. 14, 2023), Stanford Univ. Grad. Sch. of Bus. Rsch Paper No.\n4263085, UC San Francisco Rsch. Paper No. Forthcoming, available at https://ssrn.com/abstract=4263085\n(retrieved from SSRN Elsevier database) (\u201cGipper et al. (2023)\u201d); see also supra note 1363 (explaining that\nnon-CPAs are unable to use AICPA or PCAOB attestation standards).\n2712 Other studies also report evidence of third-party assurance among smaller samples of companies analyzed.\nFor example, according to a recent study by the International Federation of Accountants (\u201cIFAC\u201d), in 2019,\n99 out of the 100 largest U.S. companies by market capitalization provided some form of sustainability\ndisclosure, which may contain climate-related information among other sustainability-related topics.\nSeventy of those companies obtained some level of third-party assurance, with the vast majority being\n\u201climited assurance\u201d according to the study. Of the 70 companies that obtained assurance, the study reports\nthat 54 obtained \u201climited assurance,\u201d eight obtained \u201creasonable assurance,\u201d five obtained \u201cmoderate\nassurance,\u201d and three did not disclose any assurance. Of the 81 unique assurance reports examined in the\nstudy, nine were found to be issued by an auditing firm, while 72 were issued by another service provider.\nSee IFAC, supra note 1089. Among the sample of 436 companies included in the CCMC Survey, 28%\ndisclosed that they engaged a third party to provide some form of auditing or assurance regarding their\nclimate-related or ESG disclosure.\n638\n\nof Bloomberg ESG data, which focuses on registrants listed on NYSE and NASDAQ,\napproximately 15 percent obtained some type of third-party assurance or verification2713 on their\nenvironmental policies and data, nearly all of which are non-SRCs and non-EGCs.2714 Based on\nanalysis of S&P 500 companies from 2010 through 2020, a 2023 study finds that the most\ncommon form of assurance standard used for GHG emissions is the ISO 14064,2715 which is the\nassurance standard typically applied by assurance providers who are not accountants.2716\nSpecifically, across Scopes 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions, approximately 40 percent of the\nassurance performed utilizes ISO 14064-3. Application of other assurance standards are reported\nto be also consistent across Scopes 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions: around 10 percent for AICPA,\naround 10 percent for AccountAbility\u2019s AA1000, around 16 percent for IAASB ISAE, and\naround 30 percent for miscellaneous in-house assurance standards and protocols.2717 An analysis\nof S&P 500 firms in 2021 reveals a similar finding with ISO 14064-3 being the most common\nassurance standard referenced in ESG reporting followed by the IAASB ISAE, which\nexperienced an increase of 41 more references compared to the previous year (i.e., 54 percent\nincrease).2718\n2713 As discussed in section II.I.5.c, assurance services are services performed in accordance with professional\nstandards that are designed to provide assurance, while in many cases verification services are not designed\nto provide assurance.\n2714 Consistent with rates of voluntary GHG emissions disclosures, the percentages become much smaller when\nthe sample analyzed is expanded to include smaller registrants. The breakdown for LAF, AFs, and NAFs is\nas follows: 25%, 4%, and 1%, respectively.\n2715 See Gipper et al. (2023).\n2716 See Center for Audit Quality, S&P 500 ESG Reporting and Assurance Analysis (2023), available at\nhttps://www.thecaq.org/sp-500-and-esg-reporting (stating, in the context of the study, that the most\ncommon standard used by non-accountant providers was ISO 14064-3).\n2717 Percentages do not add up to 100% because assurance statements can sometimes reference multiple\nassurance standards.\n2718 Center for Audit Quality, supra note 2716.\n639\n\nB. Broad Economic Considerations\n1. Investor Demand for Additional Climate Information\nComments received in response to the Proposing Release, previously discussed in section\nII.A.2, indicate that there is broad support from investors for more reliable, consistent, and\ncomparable information on how climate-related risks can impact companies\u2019 operations and\nfinancial conditions.2719 The results of multiple recent surveys2720 and evidence in academic\nstudies2721 also indicate strong demand from investors for multiple types for disclosures of\n2719 This includes support for climate-related disclosure in the form of numerous letters from individuals as well\nas letters from investment managers and investment advisers. See supra section II.A.\n2720 See, e.g., Morrow Sodali, Institutional Investor Survey (2021), available at\nhttps://morrowsodali.com/uploads/INSTITUTIONAL-INVESTOR-SURVEY-2021.pdf (\u201cMorrow Sodali\n(2021)\u201d). This survey solicited the views of 42 global institutional investors managing over $29 trillion in\nassets (more than a quarter of global assets under management). Results show that 85% of surveyed\ninvestors cited climate change as the leading issue driving their engagements with companies, and 61%\nindicated that they would benefit from disclosures that more clearly link climate-related risks to financial\nrisks and opportunities. See also, e,g., E. Ilhan, et al., Climate Risk Disclosure and Institutional Investors,\n36 Rev. Fin. Stud. 2617 (2023) (\u201cIlhan et al. (2023)\u201d) (\u201cThrough a survey and analyses of observational\ndata, we provide systematic evidence that institutional investors value and demand climate risk\ndisclosures\u201d). The sample consists of 439 institutional investor respondents. Results show that 68% of\nrespondents either agreed or strongly agreed that management discussions on climate risk are not\nsufficiently precise. Also, 74% either agreed or strongly agreed that investors should demand that portfolio\ncompanies disclose their exposure to climate risk, while 59% engaged (or planned to engage) portfolio\ncompanies to provide disclosures in line with the TCFD. Lastly, 73% of institutional investors surveyed\neither agreed or strongly agreed that standardized and mandatory reporting on climate risk is necessary.\nThe authors state that \u201crespondents are likely biased toward investors with a high ESG awareness.\u201d\n2721 See also Christensen et al.

These commenters agreed with the Commission\u2019s assessment in the\nProposing Release that the current set of voluntary disclosures are inadequate to meet investor\nneeds. Accordingly, these commenters expressed support for new rules to enhance the\nconsistency, comparability, and reliability of climate-related disclosures.\nOther commenters questioned both the Commission\u2019s rationale for the proposed rules and\nthe views of supportive commenters. Some of these commenters characterized the demand for\nclimate-related information as being concentrated among a small set of institutional investors,\nwho did not represent investors more broadly.2724 Other commenters expressed the view that\ninstitutional investors are influenced by motives other than the desire to obtain the best financial\nreturn for their clients.2725 Relatedly, one commenter expressed the view that climate-related\n2722 See discussion supra sections I and II.A.; see also Christensen et al.

From that\nBCG study, the commenter cites a footnote (slide 17): \u201cHowever, most of the investors BCG recently\nsurveyed indicated that ESG is not currently a primary consideration in day-to-day investment decisions\nand recommendations.\u201d Simply because a matter is not a day-to-day consideration does not imply that\ndisclosure relating to it is unimportant to an investor.\n2725 See, e.g., letters from Cunningham et al.; David R. Burton; Domestic Energy Producers\u2019 Alliance; National\nFuel Corporation; Western Energy Alliance and U.S. Oil & Gas Association; and Competitive Enterprise\nInstitute.

We received\nnumerous comment letters from investors, both institutional and individual, expressing a need for\nmore reliable, consistent, and comparable climate-related information.2727 Furthermore,\ninstitutional managers\u2019 demand for climate-related disclosures likely reflects what they believe\nto be in the best interests of their investors and clients, including individuals.2728 Institutional\ninvestors have strong incentives to earn financial returns on behalf of their clients.\nMoreover, climate risk information can be informative about financial performance in a\nway that goes beyond current accounting numbers. As stock prices reflect profits potentially\nyears in the future, even long-term climate-related risks can affect profitability, though not all\nclimate risks are necessarily long-term. In any case, risks to cash flows, even those that are far in\nthe future, can still be important for investors today.2729\n2726 See Overdahl exhibit to letter from Chamber.\n2727 See supra section II.A.2.\n2728 See, e.g., letters from PIMCO and ICI.

Current Impediments to Climate Disclosures\nIn the Proposing Release, the Commission stated that, in practice, investors\u2019 demand for\nclimate-related information is often met by inconsistent and incomplete disclosures due to the\nconsiderable variation in the coverage, specificity, location, and reliability of information related\nto climate risk.2730 Furthermore, the Commission noted that multiple third-party reporting\nframeworks and data providers have emerged over the years but these resources lack\nmechanisms to ensure compliance and have contributed to reporting fragmentation.2731 Many\ncommenters supported these observations.2732\nThe Commission also described a set of conditions that could contribute to the market\nfailing to achieve an optimal level of climate disclosure from the point of view of investors.2733\nBriefly put, these market failures stemmed from the existence of information externalities\n(implying that registrants may fully internalize the costs of disclosure but not the benefits, which\nmay lead them to under-disclose relative to what is optimal from investors\u2019 perspective), from\nagency problems in that managers may not be motivated to disclose information due to agency\nconcerns, and the fact that disclosures may not elicit uniform responses from investors. In\narticulating these market failures, the Commission drew on a long-standing literature in\ninvestors will receive the cash flows from the asset, is in excess of 35 years as of 2019. This indicates that\nchanges in cash flows in the future can impact equity prices today. See E. Ilhan, Z. Sautner & G. Vilkov,\nCarbon Tail Risk, 34 Rev. of Fin.

This commenter also pointed to a statement from a set of\neconomists that considered how the Commission should approach disclosures of environmental and social\nissues.

Although the final rules require some disclosure of GHG emissions, contrary to the FER\nStatement\u2019s concerns, those disclosures are not intended to promote an \u201cunderstanding [of] how the firm\u2019s\nactivities affect society.\u201d Id. Instead, consistent with the FER Statement\u2019s suggestion, the GHG emissions\ndisclosure requirements are intended to help investors understand the risks to which registrants are subject\nso that they can make better-informed investment and voting decisions. Moreover, the commenter\nneglected to reference the group\u2019s recommendation that \u201c[t]he SEC should mandate disclosure of E&S-\nrelated cash flow effects, including investments that alter E&S outcomes.\u201d Overall, therefore, we believe\nour approach is broadly consistent with the FER Statement\u2019s recommendation to focus on \u201cunderstanding\nthe impact of E&S activities on the firm\u2019s value through their effects on a firm\u2019s cash flows.\u201d\n644\n\ndisclosure, namely, a market failure in this context. These together establish the basis for\nCommission action.\nC. Benefits and Costs\nWe begin with a general discussion of the final rules\u2019 benefits and costs (section IV.C.1).\nWe then turn to the benefits and costs that are specific to particular provisions of the final rules\n(section IV.C.2). Finally, we discuss estimates of quantifiable direct costs of compliance with\nthe final rules (section IV.C.3).\n1. General Discussion of Benefits and Costs\na. Benefits\nThe final rules will require comprehensive and standardized climate-related disclosures,\nincluding disclosure on governance, business strategy, targets and goals, GHG emissions, risk\nmanagement, and financial statement metrics. This information will enable investors to better\nassess material risks in climate-related reporting and facilitate comparisons across firms and over\ntime.\nAcademic literature shows a well-established link between climate-related risks and firm\nfundamentals.2737 In an international study of over 17,000 firms from 1995 to 2019, researchers\n2737 One commenter said that the Commission did not explain \u201cwhy climate-related information would often be\nmaterial to investors when other information, such as cash flows, profitability and industry, are likely to be\nmuch more relevant to an investment decision.\u201d See Overdahl exhibit to letter from Chamber (citing BCG\nInvestor Perspectives Series Pulse Check #19, supra note 2724). We disagree with the premise underlying\nthis comment. Indeed, as other commenters have expressed, understanding the impact of climate-related\nrisks is important, for investors to assess current financial information such as cash flows and profitability\nand thus to make informed investment decisions. See supra section IV.B.1. Moreover, disclosure\nregarding the potentially likely material impacts of a registrant\u2019s climate-related risks may be more\ninformative about future cash flows than disclosure regarding its current cash flows. This commenter cites\nas evidence an academic study, A. Moss, J.P. Naughton & C. Wang, The Irrelevance of Environmental,\nSocial, and Governance Disclosure to Retail Investors, Mgmt. Sci. (2023) (also submitted to the comment\nfile by the authors, see letter from James P. Naughton). This study suggests that the portfolios of retail\ninvestors on one trading platform are not different on days of ESG press releases. We received numerous\n645\n\nfound that increased exposure to higher temperatures, a form of physical climate risk, reduces\nfirm revenues and operating income.2738 Another study found that drought risk, another form of\nphysical climate risk, predicts poor profit growth.2739 A third study found that exposure to\nphysical climate risk leads firms to choose capital structures with less debt due to higher\nexpected distress costs and greater operating costs.2740 Researchers have found that banks with\nfinancial exposure in their lending portfolios to extreme climate-related hazards (e.g., hurricanes)\nexperience higher loan losses and lower long-run profitability.2741 Other studies document\neffects of climate-related transition risks on innovation, employment and investment policies.2742\nRelatedly, research shows that publicly available climate-related information is reflected\nin asset prices, which is an indication that such information affects the prices at which investors\ncomments speaking to difficulties in analyzing current climate disclosures, and this paper\u2019s findings are\nconsistent with this feedback. We acknowledge, however, that this study is subject to certain limitations,\nsuch as the fact that its findings center around disclosures on social issues more generally (rather than\nspecifically focusing on climate-related risks). Also, voluntary disclosures are analytically subject to a dual\nselection problem. See Christensen et al. (2021), at 1208. The dual selection problem refers to two\nconcurrent issues that pose challenges in determining causality. The first stems from the fact that\nobservable ESG disclosures are from companies that voluntarily choose to disclose, reflecting a selection\nbias. The second is the challenge of disentangling the effects of disclosure by itself from the effects of the\nunderlying CSR activities.\n2738 See Nora Pankratz, Rob Bauer & Jeroen Derwall, Climate Change, Firm Performance, and Investor\nSurprises, 69 Mgmt Sci. 7352 (2023).\n2739 See Harrison Hong, Frank Weikai Li & Jiangmin Xu, Climate Risks and Market Efficiency, 208 J. of\nEconometrics 265 (Jan. 2019); Claudia Custodio, et al., How Does Climate Change Affect Firm Sales?\nIdentifying Supply Effects (June 30, 2022), available at\nhttps://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3724940 (retrieved from SSRN Elsevier database)\n(describing decline in labor and sales due to extreme temperatures in manufacturing and other heat-\nsensitive industries).\n2740 See Edith Ginglinger & Quentin Moreau, Climate Risk and Capital Structure, 69 Mgmt Sci. 7492 (2023).\nSimilar evidence also appears in the context of transition risk where researchers find that firms with higher\ncarbon emissions exhibit lower leverage when their banks through commitments to decarbonize are found\nto supply less credit to these firms.

Kacperczyk & Jos\u00e9-Luis Peydr\u00f3, Carbon Emissions and\nthe Bank-lending Channel (Aug. 2022), available at\nhttps://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3915486 (retrieved from SSRN Elsevier database).\n2741 See Yao Lu & Valeri V.

Providing better information to\ninvestors will, in turn, reduce information asymmetries between managers and investors as well\nas amongst investors2747 (i.e., reduce any informational advantages), which will improve\nliquidity and reduce transaction costs for investors (i.e., reduce adverse selection), and may\nlower firms\u2019 cost of capital.2748\n2746 See, e.g., Robert F Engle, et al., Hedging Climate Change News, 33 Rev. Fin. Stud. 1184 (2020).\n2747 This information asymmetry can result from the fact that it currently requires considerable resources to\ninfer a registrant\u2019s exposure to or management of climate-related risks using the existing publicly available\ninformation provided through voluntary disclosures. See, e.g., letters from Vermont Pension Investment\nCommission; CalSTERS; and Wellington (describing how these commenters currently glean such\ninformation, incurring costs related to development of proprietary models, devoting considerable resources\nto reviews of public information, and subscribing to services from other data providers).\n2748 See section IV.E. for more information on capital market benefits; see also Christensen et al.

Verrecchia,\nEssays on Disclosure, 32 J. of Acct. & Econ. 97 (Dec. 2001). More recently, researchers used international\nevidence to find that mandatory ESG disclosures improves stock liquidity, see P. Krueger, Z. Sautner, D.Y.\nTang & R. Zhong, The Effects of Mandatory ESG Disclosure Around the World, Euro. Corp. Gov. Inst. \u2013\nFinance Working Paper No. 754/2021 (Jan. 12, 2024). Asymmetric information occurs when one party to\nan economic transaction possesses greater material knowledge than the other party. Adverse selection\noccurs when the more knowledgeable party only chooses to transact in settings that, based on their private\ninformation, is advantageous for them. Less informed parties, aware of their informational disadvantage,\nmight be less inclined to transact at all for fear of being taken advantage of. See George Akerlof, The\n648\n\nThe final rules will also integrate climate-related risk disclosures into the existing\nRegulation S-K and S-X disclosure frameworks. Investors will therefore find information about\nall the material risks that companies face\u2014not just climate-related risks\u2014 within a centralized\nsource (i.e., Commission filings, as opposed to sustainability reports, brochures, or company\nwebsites), thereby reducing search costs, and will receive this information in a more timely\nmanner and on a regular schedule.2749 These benefits should be especially pronounced for\nfinancial institutions with significant exposure to climate-related risks through their portfolio\ncompanies since any enhancements in the portfolio companies\u2019 disclosures will better position\nthe institutions to assess their portfolio-level risks.2750\nFurthermore, by treating the climate-related disclosures as \u201cfiled,\u201d these disclosures will\nbe subject to potential liability under the Exchange Act and the Securities Act, which will\nincentivize registrants to take additional care to ensure the accuracy of the disclosures, thereby\nMarket for Lemons, Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism, 84 Q. J. of Econ. 488 (Aug. 1970).\nOne commenter claimed that the final rules could result in adverse selection if companies with the most\nexposure to climate risks choose to de-register or opt out of registration (see letter from Chamber). We\ndisagree with this claim. We believe the benefits of being a public registered company are sufficiently\nstrong such that it is unlikely many companies will choose to avoid becoming or continuing as a public\nregistered company as a result of the final rules. See section IV.E.3 for more information.\n2749 See supra note 2570.\n2750 See Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk 2021, FSOC, available at\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/FSOC-Climate-Report.pdf (\u201cDemand for information about\nclimate-related risks and opportunities has grown significantly, driven by investors and financial\ninstitutions that are interested in managing their exposure to climate risks\u2026 Further, it is important to note\nthat to assess and quantify their own climate-related financial risks, particularly transition risks, financial\ninstitutions need access to climate-related risk information from the companies they are financing and\ninvesting in.\u201d); CDP, CDP Non-Disclosure Campaign: 2021 Results (2021), available at\nhttps://cdn.cdp.net/cdp-production/cms/reports/documents/000/006/069/original/CDP_2021_Non-\nDisclosure_Campaign_Report_10_01_22_%281%29.pdf; see also letter from BNP Paribas (\u201cGiven the\nincreasing awareness of corporates and the financial community about the need to accelerate the transition\nto a low carbon economy, establishing robust and comparable climate related disclosure standards is critical\nto providing investors decision-useful information. In particular, this information is essential for banks and\nasset managers to assess climate-related risks for lending purposes and making investment decisions, to\ndefine portfolio alignment strategies in the context of a registrant\u2019s net zero commitments\u2026\u201d).\n649\n\nresulting in more reliable disclosures.2751 Several commenters expressed support for treating\nclimate-related disclosures as filed, noting that it would help improve investor confidence in the\naccuracy and completeness of such disclosures.2752\nFor disclosures other than financial statement disclosures, the final rules will provide\nregistrants with the flexibility to determine the appropriate placement within their filing of\nclimate-related disclosures. While this could affect investors\u2019 ability to easily locate and\ncompare those disclosures, we believe that this concern is largely mitigated by the final rules\u2019\nstructured data requirement. The structured disclosure requirements we are adopting, including\nthe requirement to tag such disclosures using XBRL, will enable search and retrieval of the\ndisclosures on an automated and large-scale basis, allowing investors, and the market, to process\ninformation much more effectively and efficiently as compared to manual searches through\nunstructured formats. This will improve investors\u2019 assessment of companies\u2019 estimated future\ncash flows, leading to more accurate company valuations and lowering companies\u2019 cost of\ncapital.2753\nAdditionally, having access to more reliable information could result in cost savings for\nthose investors who collect or organize information about climate-related risks. Several\n2751 However, we note that these benefits will be mitigated for certain forward-looking statements, including\nthose related to transition plan disclosures, scenario analysis, internal carbon pricing, and climate-related\ntargets and goals, as these statements will have the benefit of safe harbor protections if the safe harbor\nrequirements are satisfied.\n2752 See, e.g., letters from Amer. For Fin. Reform, Sunrise Project et al.; Ags of Cal. et al.; CalPERS; Ceres;\nCFA; Engine No. 1; Franklin Templeton; PwC; SKY Harbor; and TotalEnergies.\n2753 See Christensen et al. (2021), at 1187; R. Lambert, C. Leuz & R.E. Verrecchia, Accounting Information,\nDisclosure, and the Cost of Capital, 45 J. of Acct. Rsch. 385 (May 2007); D. Easley & M.

To the extent there is overlap between the disclosures required by the final rules and the\ntypes of information considered by ESG ratings providers, the final rules may reduce reliance on\nthese third parties, thereby reducing costs incurred by investors to obtain decision-useful\ninformation. ESG ratings are not necessarily standardized or transparent with respect to their\nunderlying methodologies, and several studies have found that different ESG ratings providers\noften assign inconsistent ratings for the same registrant.2755 To the extent the final rules reduce\nreliance on these ratings, registrants and investors could benefit by saving money that would\notherwise be spent on obtaining third-party ESG ratings.2756 Alternatively, the disclosures\nelicited by the final rules may increase the value of these third-party services to the extent that\nthe third-party services are able to leverage the enhanced disclosures to provide investors with\n2754 See, e.g., letter from CalSTRS (stating, \u201cThe current reporting requirements are insufficient for investors to\nassess corporate climate risk and the related financial impacts to execute investment decisions. CalSTRS\nspends approximately $2,200,000 per year to access climate research, analyze available data, and develop\nmethods to estimate climate risks and opportunities for assets in our portfolio. In addition to two full-time\ninvestment staff members, CalSTRS consults external advisors to learn how other global asset owners\ndetermine climate risk exposures to their portfolios given the lack of reliable, consistent, and\ncomprehensive data.

Fin. 1315 (Nov. 2022). The authors found that the correlations between six different ESG ratings are\non average 0.54, and range from 0.38 to 0.71, while the correlations between credit ratings were 0.99. See\nalso Scott Robinson et al., supra note 2721; Dane Christensen, George Serafeim & Anywhere Sikochi,\nWhy is Corporate Virtue in the Eye of the Beholder? The Case of ESG Ratings, Acct. Rev.

The disclosures may also allow registrants to better monitor ESG ratings,\nwhich could reduce the risk of greenwashing.\nb. Costs\nThe final rules will impose direct costs of compliance on registrants. We use the term\n\u201cdirect costs\u201d or \u201ccompliance costs\u201d to include (1) any costs related to developing or maintaining\nsystems for collecting information to comply with the final rules, (2) costs of preparing and\npresenting the resulting disclosures for Commission filings, which we refer to as \u201creporting\ncosts,\u201d2757 (3) costs associated with assuring the accuracy of the disclosures, such as audit and\nattestation costs, and (4) any legal or disclosure review costs incurred to support management\u2019s\nassertion that the disclosures comply with the final rules. These costs could be incurred\ninternally (e.g., through employee hours or hiring additional staff) or externally (e.g., via third-\nparty service providers, such as auditors or consultants). Numerous commenters expressed\nconcerns over the direct costs of compliance on registrants of the proposed rules.2758 As\ndiscussed in section II.A, the final rules include certain modifications relative to the proposed\nrules that reduce overall costs and help address commenters\u2019 concerns about the time and\nresources required to comply with the final rules\u2019 requirements.2759 This concern could further\nbe mitigated for certain registrants to the extent that the final rules generally align with the\ndisclosure frameworks that they are already using for their voluntary disclosures or disclosures\n2757 Specifically, \u201creporting costs\u201d refer to the costs of preparing information to be presented in Commission\nfilings, separate from any prior costs or resources expended in obtaining or developing such information.\nFor example, the final rules will require some registrants to disclose their Scope 1 and 2 emissions. For\nregistrants that already disclose them, the incremental cost will only be the reporting cost, distinct from any\ncosts they have previously voluntarily incurred related to developing emissions measurement/estimation\nsystems and processes in order to quantify their emissions.\n2758 See, e.g., letters from Chamber; Nutrien; Williams Companies; Energy Transfer LP; Hess; PPL; NRF;\nRILA; ConocoPhillips; NASDAQ; API; and SCG.\n2759 See, e.g., letter from Chamber.\n652\n\nthat are, or will be, required by state, Federal, or other laws.2760 Many commenters submitted\ncost estimates for the proposed rules that varied considerably depending on a given company\u2019s\nsize, industry, complexity of operations, and other characteristics. We review these comments\nand discuss cost estimates in detail in sections IV.C.2 and IV.C.3. The remainder of this section\nfocuses on other costs that may result from the final rules.\nThe final rules may result in additional litigation risk for registrants.2761 However, the\nfinal rules include several changes from the proposal to mitigate these concerns. For example,\ncertain forward-looking statements, including those related to transition plan disclosures,\nscenario analysis, internal carbon pricing, and climate-related targets and goals, will have the\nbenefit of certain liability protections if the adopted safe harbor requirements are satisfied.\nAnother example is the inclusion of phase in periods after the effective date to provide\nregistrants with additional time to become familiar with and meet the final rules\u2019 disclosure\nrequirements. In addition, Scope 3 emissions disclosure is no longer required and the\namendments to Regulation S-X have been modified to lessen the compliance requirements,\namong other examples.\n2760 See section IV.A.3 for discussion of existing state and Federal laws.\n2761 See letter from NAM (expressing concern about treating climate-related disclosures as \u201cfiled,\u201d noting the\n\u201cevolving and uncertain nature\u201d of GHG emissions disclosures could make it difficult for registrants to\nreach the degree of certainty necessary to assume the liability burden associated with reports filed with the\nCommission); see also letter from Chamber (noting that the complexity of the proposed rules could\nincrease the likelihood of nuisance lawsuits that are intended to extract a settlement thereby increasing the\ncost of compliance with the rules). This commenter also pointed out that audit costs could increase if\nauditors were also subject to increased litigation risk. See also letter from Cunningham et al. (noting that\n\u201cThe SEC recognizes that a major cost of the Proposal concerns litigation risk.\u201d); Overdahl exhibit to letter\nfrom Chamber (noting the increase in litigation risk can also result in higher insurance costs for registrants\nand auditors).\n653\n\nSome commenters expressed concerns that the proposed disclosures would over-\nemphasize climate risks relative to other types of risks that investors might find important.2762 A\nrelated concern that commenters raised is that potentially voluminous disclosures could obscure\nthe information that investors deem most relevant to their investment or voting decisions.2763 To\nmitigate such concerns (in addition to concerns related to the compliance costs) the final rules\nare less prescriptive in certain places relative to the proposed rules. The final rules also have\nadditional materiality qualifiers such that registrants that determine climate risks to be immaterial\nwill have fewer disclosure obligations relative to the proposal. These costs also are expected to\nbe mitigated by the structured data requirements of the final rules, which will make it easier for\ninvestors to find and analyze relevant information in filings. These changes also address other\ncommenters\u2019 concerns that mandatory climate disclosure requirements that are too prescriptive\nor granular may lead to inefficient changes in business strategies and limit or halt innovation in\nthe market for voluntary climate disclosures.2764\nWe also acknowledge the concerns expressed by several commenters that the proposed\nrules would have required the disclosure of confidential or proprietary information,2765 which\n2762 See, e.g., Overdahl exhibit to letter from Chamber, stating, \u201cbecause climate-related information is just one\nfactor among many other (potentially more relevant) factors, climate-related information is often not\nmaterial;\u201d see also letters from API; Western Energy Alliance and the U.S. Oil & Gas Association;\nMatthew Winden; American Council of Engineering Companies; Chamber; and Wisconsin Manufacturers\n& Commerce.\n2763 See, e.g., letters from Chamber; Soc. Corp. Gov.; and ConocoPhillips. For example, investors may be\nunable to review all potentially relevant information, resulting in suboptimal decisions. See, e.g., H.A.\nSimon, A Behavioral Model of Rational Choice, 69 Q. J. of Econ. 99 (Feb. 1955); H.A. Simon, Rationality\nAs Process and As Product of Thought, 68 Am. Econ. Rev. 1 (May 1978); K.L. Chapman, N. Reiter &\nH.D. White, et al., Information Overload and Disclosure Smoothing, 24 Rev Acct. Stud. 1486 (Dec. 2019).\n2764 See, e.g., letters from API; Matthew Winden; Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America; Petrol. OK.;\nand Chamber.\n2765 See, e.g., supra notes 479, 596, and surrounding text. Proprietary costs are generally relevant for reporting\nthat involves information about a companies\u2019 business operations or production processes and disclosures\n654\n\ncan put affected registrants at a competitive disadvantage. This consequence could alter\nregistrants\u2019 incentives to develop strategies to manage climate-related risks where it would\notherwise be beneficial to do so.2766 The final rules have been narrowed relative to the proposed\nrules to provide additional flexibility to limit costs associated with the disclosure of\ncompetitively sensitive information, while retaining disclosures that will help investors\nunderstand registrants\u2019 climate-related risks. In particular, we have eliminated certain\nprescriptive requirements from the proposal that commenters identified as potentially revealing\ncompetitively sensitive information and for which the benefits to investors were less\napparent.2767 For example, by providing registrants with flexibility to determine how best to\ndescribe their strategy towards managing climate-related risks, the final rules may enable them to\navoid disclosure of competitively sensitive information.2768 Furthermore, while we have\neliminated the requirement to disclose ZIP code level information, the final rules continue to\nrequire location disclosures sufficient to understand a registrants\u2019 exposure to physical risks. We\nalso have eliminated the requirement to disclose interim targets or goals. At the same time, we\nacknowledge that, in some instances, a more flexible approach may also result in less\ncomparable disclosures. While this has the possibility of reducing the value of the disclosures to\ninvestors, we believe this approach appropriately balances investor protection with concerns\nraised by commenters.\nthat are specific, detailed and process-oriented.

For example, the increased disclosures may reduce\ninstitutional investors\u2019 reliance on ESG ratings providers, which could negatively impact these\nproviders.2769 Conversely, more comprehensive disclosures could reduce the cost of producing\nESG ratings or may improve the informational content of the ratings, thereby increasing demand.\nThis could benefit not only the ratings providers, but also investors that rely on ESG ratings.\nMany commenters raised concerns about costs to third parties from the proposed\nrules,2770 with one commenter stating that \u201cmeasuring and reporting of GHG emissions would be\na prerequisite for doing business with registrants and most retailers under this proposal.\u201d2771\nCompared to the proposed rules, the final rules do not impose such costs because they do not\ninclude Scope 3 disclosure requirements. Other disclosure items under the final rules may\ncontinue to result in registrants seeking input from third parties, such as those disclosure items\nrequiring disclosure of material impacts from climate-related risks on purchasers, suppliers, or\nother counterparties to material contracts with registrants. However, the final rules limit the\ncompliance burden of this requirement by limiting information that should be disclosed to that\nwhich is \u201cknown or reasonably available,\u201d thereby eliminating any potential need for registrants\nto undertake unreasonable searches or requests for information from such third parties. Given\nthe more flexible and tailored approach in the final rules, such consultations will pertain only to\nparties whose relationship with the registrant is most likely to materially impact the registrant\u2019s\n2769 We note that this \u201ccost\u201d is from the perspective of the ratings providers and could be offset by the\nefficiency gain that renders their intermediation less necessary; as such, it reflects more of a transfer than a\nnet economic \u201ccost.\u201d\n2770 See letter from the Heritage Foundation, which estimates compliance costs of the proposed rules on non-\nregistrants would total $14 billion.\n2771 See letter from International Dairy Foods Association.\n656\n\nstrategy, business model and outlook, as well as parties from whom the registrant may be best\npositioned to request information, thus lowering these costs.\nSome commenters asserted that a registrant\u2019s compliance costs could be passed on to\nother parties such as consumers (via higher prices), workers (through reduced wages or benefits),\nor shareholders (in the form of lower earnings).2772 Other commenters stated that compliance\ncosts could vary across industries.2773 We acknowledge that third parties could bear some of the\nincreased costs of compliance arising from the final rules and that this effect may be more\npronounced in certain industries than in others. The final rules include significant changes from\nthe proposal that lower the burdens on registrants. To the extent that these changes result in\nlower compliance costs, they also will help mitigate any adverse effects on other parties.\nThere is some existing academic literature on costs related to mandatory climate-related\ndisclosures in other jurisdictions.2774 Some studies report lower profitability and costly\noperational adjustments for firms affected by mandatory CSR disclosure and GHG emissions\nreporting in China and the United Kingdom, respectively.2775 However, other studies do not find\nan impact on financial operating performance from mandating climate-related disclosures.2776\n2772 See, e.g., letters from National Fuel Corporation; Petrol. OK; Footwear Distributors & Retails of America;\nTruth in Energy and Climate; ASA; and David R. Burton.\n2773 See letters from API; and Matthew Winden.\n2774 Commenters stated that there is limited evidence on the overall economic impact of mandatory climate-\nrelated disclosure regimes in other jurisdictions. See letter from Committee on Capital Markets Regulation\n(June 16, 2022) (\u201cCCMR\u201d); and Overdahl exhibit to letter from Chamber; see also Christensen et al.\n(2021).\n2775 See Y .Chen, M.

Stud. 1137\n(2021).\n657\n\nAnother study showed aggregate stock price movement associated with mandatory climate-\nrelated disclosure; while the study found, on average, a negative market reaction, the negative\nstock returns were concentrated in firms with weak ESG performance and disclosure, while firms\nwith above-median ESG performance and disclosure exhibited a positive abnormal return.2777\nWe note that differences between the final rules and these other mandates (e.g., materiality\nqualifiers) suggest that similar costs associated with the final rules may be lower.\nAs discussed in sections IV.C.2.f and IV.C.3.c, the final rules may have implications for\nassurance providers or, more generally, for third parties with climate-related expertise. In the\nshort run, the rules may increase demand (and accordingly, the cost) for climate-related expertise\nand/or assurance of emissions disclosures. Over time, we expect the supply of third parties with\nclimate-related expertise will adjust to correspond with the increased demand, leading to reduced\ncosts.\nFinally, the modifications made in the final rules to reduce overall costs will help address,\nto an extent, some commenters\u2019 concerns that costs associated with the proposed rules could\nfactor into a company\u2019s decision to become or remain a public reporting company.2778 In\nresponse to other commenters\u2019 concerns,2779 the final rules also provide EGCs and SRCs with a\n2777 See letter from CCMR. See also Proposing Release, section IV.C.1., at n. 848, citing Jody Grewal, Edward\nJ. Riedl & George Serafeim, Market Reaction to Mandatory Nonfinancial Disclosure, 65 Mgmt Sci. 3061\n(2019). We note that the study\u2019s findings are based on the assumption that the only news disproportionately\naffecting the treated companies was the policy at issue, as opposed to some other event(s) impacting the\ntreated companies.\n2778 See, e.g., letter from Chamber and section II.L.2. For example, private companies might decide to defer a\npublic offering, and existing public companies might decide to deregister from U.S. securities markets or\nnot pursue mergers that would subject the merged company to reporting requirements. Other provisions\nthat will reduce costs for conducting an IPO include (i) registrants will only have to provide Article 14\ndisclosure for historical fiscal years on a prospective basis, and (ii) the PSLRA statutory safe harbor for\nforward-looking statements (with respect to transition plans, scenario analysis, targets and goals) will apply\nto registration statements in IPOs.\n2779 See sections II.H.2 and II.O.2 for a discussion of commenters\u2019 concerns on GHG emissions disclosures and\nphase in periods, respectively.\n658\n\nlonger phase in period for climate-related disclosures (including financial statement disclosures\nunder Regulation S-X) and exempt EGCs and SRCs from GHG emissions disclosure\nrequirements. And, while climate-related disclosures will be required in registration statements\nfor firms conducting IPOs, we are not applying the subpart 1500 and Article 14 disclosure\nrequirements to a private company that is a party to a business combination transaction, as\ndefined by Securities Act Rule 165(f), involving a securities offering registered on Form S-4 or\nF-4.2780\n2. Analysis of Specific Provisions\nThe costs incurred by any particular registrant may vary significantly depending upon\nwhich, if any, of the disclosures required under the final rules are applicable to that registrant's\noperations and circumstances. We discuss the costs of specific components of the rules below.\na. Disclosure of Climate-Related Risks\nThe final rules require registrants to identify any climate-related risks that have materially\nimpacted or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the registrant, including on its\nstrategy, results of operations, or financial condition.2781 For any risks identified, registrants are\nrequired to provide information necessary to an understanding of the nature of the risk presented\nand whether the risk is a physical or transition risk. Registrants are also required to classify\nwhether these risks are reasonably likely to manifest in the short-term and in the long-term. For\nboth physical and transition risks, registrants are required, as applicable, to provide detailed\n2780 See supra section II.L.3. While this approach avoids imposing additional costs on companies engaged in\nbusiness combination transactions involving a private company, we note that investors will not have the\nbenefit of the disclosures required by the final rules with respect to such private company.\n2781 See 17 CFR 229.1502(a).\n659\n\ninformation on these risks (e.g., the particular type of transition risk as well as the geographic\nlocation and nature of the properties, processes, or operations subject to the physical risk).\nThis aspect of the final rules will improve investors\u2019 understanding of what a registrant\nconsiders to be the relevant short-term and long-term climate-related risks that have materially\nimpacted or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on its business. As a number of\ncommenters have noted, climate-related risks often translate into material financial risks with\nimplications for firm growth and profitability, and therefore investors would benefit from a\ndisclosure regime that requires registrants to provide information on climate-related risks that is\naccurate and more comparable to each other.2782\nAcademic research has found that retail investors as well as institutional investors value\nand utilize information on climate-related risks in decision-making.2783 As numerous\ncommenters stated,2784 climate-related risks and their impacts on businesses are often not\n2782 See, e.g., letters from PIMCO (\u201c[W]e believe climate risks often pose a material financial risk, and\ntherefore, investors need disclosure of climate risks that is complete, reliable, and consistent in order to\nanalyze how climate-related risks may affect a company\u2019s business or overall financial performance.\u201d);\nWellington (\u201cAccurate and comparable information about climate risk is critical to Wellington\nManagement\u2019s ability to make informed investment decisions on behalf of our clients. Because climate\nchange will continue to profoundly impact society, economies and markets, investors need more\ninformation to better price these risks and fully assess the value of an issuer\u2019s securities.\u201d); and\nAllianceBernstein (\u201c[M]aterial risks and opportunities associated with climate change as fundamental\nfinancial factors that impact company cash flows and the valuation investors attribute to those cash flows.\nRegulatory changes, physical risks, and changing consumer decision criteria and preferences are all factors\nthat asset managers need to understand and integrate into their investment processes to make optimal\ninvestment decisions on behalf of their clients.\u201d)\n2783 See supra section IV.B.1. One commenter suggested that institutional investors and retail investors may\nhave different preferences for climate-related information, especially when the former consider investment\nportfolios and the latter consider individual companies. See letter from Society for Corp. Gov. The\ncommenter further argued that retail investors are unlikely to care about climate-related information given\ntheir investment horizon. Because of the documented impact of climate-related risks, including distant\nones, on asset prices, we disagree with these assertions.\n2784 See section IV.B; see also, e.g., letters from BlackRock (\u201cCompared to the existing voluntary framework,\nthe Commission\u2019s detailed analytical and disclosure roadmap . . . is more likely to increase the\ncomparability and consistency of issuers\u2019 climate-related disclosures.\u201d); Calvert (\u201cCurrently, climate\nchange disclosures are largely voluntary, unverified, and idiosyncratic.\u201d); CFA ( \u201cThe current voluntary\n660\n\nreported in a way that is useful to investors. Commenters noted that with the limitations to the\ncurrently available climate-related disclosures, extensive costs in the form of data gathering,\nresearch and analysis are needed to process them and to fill data gaps where possible in forming\ninvestment decisions.2785 We expect the final rules to reduce these information processing costs\nfor investors.2786\nWe expect the final rules will help investors gain a more accurate and complete\nunderstanding of the climate-related risks that a registrant determines have materially impacted\nor are reasonably likely to materially impact its strategy, results of operations, or financial\ncondition. By distinguishing between climate-related risks that manifest in the short-term and\nlong-term, the final rules will help inform investors about which risks are salient to their\ninvestment decision-making and which are not, depending on the time horizon investors are\nfocused on. For instance, longer term risks may be less certain and are less likely to have\nimpacts on cash flows in the short-term. As such, some investors may choose to focus more on\nclimate-related disclosure regime has resulted in inadequate and inconsistent information which falls short\nof investor demands and prevents market participants from reasonably assessing the risks of climate\nchange.\u201d); and Wellington (\u201cCurrently, our evaluation of the positive and negative impacts of climate\nchange on issuers is limited by inadequate information and the absence of a standardized framework for\ndisclosure.\u201d and that \u201cFor a significant number of issuers, information is not sufficient to support equivalent\nanalysis.\u201d).\n2785 See letter from Wellington (\u201cWe were able to make these and other determinations based on available\ninformation (including internal and external estimates), and only after extensive research and analysis. For\na significant number of issuers, information is not sufficient to support equivalent analysis.\u201d); Boston Trust\nWalden (\u201cEvaluation of climate risk across investment portfolios represents a cost to investors and results\nin the gathering of data that is often incomplete and not comparable. At Boston Trust Walden, our analysts\nexamine quantitative and qualitative climate-related corporate disclosure to enhance our understanding of\nthe existing and potential financial outcomes associated, ranging from risks (e.g., losing the license to\noperate) to opportunities (e.g., generating new sources of revenue). In the absence of mandated disclosure\nrequirements, we rely on the data of third-party research providers, which includes a mix of issuer provided\ndata and estimates. Our analysts then seek to fill data gaps through additional research and analysis,\noutreach via written requests, meetings, and shareholder resolutions seeking the expanded disclosure we\nrequire. These processes for gathering necessary climate-related disclosures are inefficient and resource\nintensive.\u201d).\n2786 The final rules may also lead to a lower cost of capital for some registrants, as we discuss below.\n661\n\nshort-term risks. Conversely, an investor with a long investment horizon may choose to focus on\nthe risks that match its investment horizon.2787 This temporal standard is consistent with an\nexisting MD&A disclosure requirement and therefore should provide a degree of familiarity to\nregistrants and investors as they prepare and analyze these disclosures.2788 This aspect of the\nfinal rules will impose additional costs on registrants (e.g., direct compliance costs and indirect\ncosts resulting from, for example, increased litigation risk). These costs are discussed in greater\ndetail in sections IV.C.1 and IV.C.3.\nb. Disclosure Regarding Impacts of Climate-Related Risks on Strategy,\nBusiness Model, and Outlook\nThe final rules require registrants to describe the actual and potential material impacts of\nany climate-related risks identified in response to Item 1502(a) on the registrant\u2019s strategy,\nbusiness model, and outlook.2789 With respect to their strategy, business model, and outlook, the\nfinal rules specify that registrants are required to assess, as applicable, any material impacts on a\nnon-exclusive list of items: business operations; products or services; suppliers, purchasers, or\ncounterparties to material contracts (to the extent known or reasonably available); activities to\nmitigate or adapt to climate-related risks; and expenditure for research and development.\nRegistrants are also required to discuss whether and how the registrant considers these impacts as\npart of its strategy, financial planning, and capital allocation.\n2787 See letter from Vanguard (\u201cclimate risks to be material and fundamental risks for investors and the\nmanagement of those risks is important for price discovery and long-term shareholder returns.\u201d).\n2788 See, e.g., letter from ABA (\u201cWe believe that climate-related matters should be addressed within the same\ntime short- and long-term time frames used in MD&A.\u201d); 17 CFR 229.303(b)(1) (\u201cAnalyze the registrant\u2019s\nability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of cash to meet its requirements and its plans for cash in\nthe short-term (i.e., the next 12 months from the most recent fiscal period end required to be presented) and\nseparately in the long-term (i.e., beyond the next 12 months).\u201d); see also section II.C.2.\n2789 See 17 CFR 1502(b)-(g).\n662\n\nWe expect the resulting disclosures to provide investors with a better understanding of\nhow climate-related risks have materially impacted or are reasonably likely to have a material\nimpact on the registrant. Such disclosures will directly benefit investors who use this\ninformation to evaluate the financial prospects of the firms in which they are looking to\ninvest.2790 Discussions of material impacts on strategy, business model, or outlook will help\ninvestors determine whether and how registrants are addressing identified material climate-\nrelated risks. This type of disclosure could be particularly useful when comparing the\napproaches taken by similarly situated registrants. For example, one registrant may disclose that\nit is actively shifting assets away from exposure to flood zones, while another might disclose that\nit is investing in such assets as they are considered currently undervalued. These disclosures will\nallow an investor to choose to invest in the company with climate-related risk strategies that best\nalign with the investor\u2019s investment objectives.\nUnder the final rules, if a registrant has adopted a transition plan to manage a material\ntransition risk, it must describe the plan. The registrant must also provide an annual update about\nany actions taken during the year under the plan, including how these expenditures have\nimpacted the registrant\u2019s financial condition, or results of operations, along with quantitative and\nqualitative disclosure of material expenditures incurred and material impacts on financial\nestimates and assumptions as a direct result of the transition plan. We expect these disclosures to\nprovide investors with more complete and reliable information about how registrants plan to\naddress material transition risks. A number of commenters indicated that these disclosures\nwould help investors assess the registrant\u2019s approach to managing climate-related risks and\n2790 See P. Krueger, Z. Sautner & L.T. Starks, The Importance of Climate Risks for Institutional Investors, 33\nRev. of Fin. Stud. 1067 (March 2020); Ilhan et al. (2023).\n663\n\nachieving its climate-related targets and goals.2791 This benefit could be reduced if these\ndisclosures provide opportunities for greenwashing. However, we expect this risk to be reduced\ngiven that these disclosures will include quantitative and qualitative information on expenditures\nthat are filed with the Commission and are subject to the applicable liability provisions under the\nSecurities Act and Exchange Act. The requirement to provide annual updates should further\nmitigate these concerns. The updating requirement will be particularly beneficial to investors as\nit will allow them to analyze the impacts of transition plans on a registrant\u2019s operations and\nfinancial condition over time.\nThe requirement to describe quantitatively and qualitatively the material expenditures\nincurred and material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions as a direct result of the\ntransition plan will help investors better understand a registrant\u2019s approach to managing climate-\nrelated risks so they have information necessary to assess how those actions have impacted the\nregistrant. Including a quantitative description of material expenditures incurred will discourage\nboilerplate disclosures and, to some extent, facilitate comparisons across registrants. However,\nwe acknowledge commenters who raised concerns about the difficulties of attributing\nexpenditures to these types of activities.2792 We recognize that similarly situated registrants may\ntake different approaches in their determination of which expenditures to include and whether to\nquantitatively or qualitatively identify portions of expenditures specifically tied to these\n2791 See, e.g., letters from CalPERS; Morningstar; Change Finance; see also letter from ICI (\u201cWe support\n[transition plan] disclosure as it would inform investors of the nature of the risks and the company\u2019s actions\nor plans to mitigate or adapt to them.\u201d); and the CFA Institute (\u201cWe support the Proposed Rule\u2019s\nrequirement that a registrant disclose, if it has adopted a transition plan (i.e., a strategy and implementation\nplan to reduce climate-related risks) as part of its climate-related risk management strategy. We agree with\nthe view that it will facilitate investor understanding of whether the company has a plan and whether it may\nbe effective in the short, medium, and long term in achieving such a transition. Presently, many companies\nhave made net-zero commitments by 2050 but have made little if any disclosures regarding how they plan\nto get there. This requirement would necessitate that they do so.\u201d)\n2792 See supra notes 1891 and 1892, and accompanying text.\n664\n\nactivities. To the extent that registrants take different approaches to identifying such\nexpenditures, the comparability benefits of the disclosure will be diminished. Nevertheless, the\nqualitative discussion accompanying the disclosures should provide the context necessary for\ninvestors to understand the registrant\u2019s approach to these activities and provide an assessment of\nthe impact of these activities on the registrant\u2019s financial condition.\nIf a registrant uses scenario analysis to assess the impact of climate-related risks on its\nbusiness, results of operations, or financial condition, and if, based on the results of such\nscenario analysis, the registrant determines that a climate-related risk is reasonably likely to have\na material impact on its business, results of operations, or financial condition, the registrant must\ndescribe each such scenario. This description must include a brief description of the parameters,\nassumptions, and analytical choices used, as well as the expected material impacts on the\nregistrant under each such scenario. Disclosures about the use of scenario analysis to stress test\nbusinesses across a range of possible future climate and climate policy scenarios can vary\nsignificantly.2793 As such, the final rules will inform investors about whether a registrant is using\nscenario analysis to manage a material climate risk, and for those investors who view scenario\nanalysis as an important tool for climate risk management, allow them to factor this information\ninto their investment decisions.2794 The required disclosures around parameters, assumptions,\nand analytical choices used by a registrant when conducting scenario analysis will allow\ninvestors to better understand the methodology underlying the scenario analysis and thereby\n2793 See Using Scenarios to Assess and Report Climate-Related C2ES 20 Financial Risk, C2ES (Aug. 2018),\nhttps://www.c2es.org/document/using-scenarios-to-assess-and-report-climate-related-financial-risk/; FRB\nof New York, Climate Stress Testing, Staff Report No. 1059 (2023).\n2794 See, e.g., Council of Institutional Investors; Boston Common Asset Management; Boston Walden Trust;\nDomini; University Network for Investor Engagement; AllianceBernstein.\n665\n\nimprove investors\u2019 assessment of the appropriateness of a registrant\u2019s strategy and business\nmodel in light of foreseeable climate-related risks.2795\nIf a registrant\u2019s use of an internal carbon price is material to how it evaluates and\nmanages climate-related risks disclosed in response to Item 1502(a), then the registrant must\ndisclose in units of the registrant\u2019s reporting currency information about the price per metric ton\nof CO e, and the total price, including how the total price is estimated to change over the short-\n2\nterm and long-term, as applicable. For registrants that use more than one internal carbon price to\nevaluate and manage a material climate-related risk, these disclosures apply to each internal\ncarbon price and the registrant must disclose reasons for using different prices. If the scope of\nentities and operations involved in the use of an internal carbon price described is materially\ndifferent from the organizational boundaries used for the purpose of calculating GHG emissions\npursuant to Item 1505, the final rules require registrants to describe the difference. We expect\nthis disclosure will provide investors with more standardized and decision-useful information\nregarding whether a registrant\u2019s use of an internal carbon price is material and, if so, how it\nimpacts its strategy, results of operations, and financial condition. This is important to address\nissues with increased voluntary corporate disclosures of internal carbon pricing.2796 By\nmandating that registrants disclose any material differences in their boundaries used for internal\ncarbon pricing and GHG emissions measurement, the final rules will help clarify for investors\nthe scope of entities and operations included in a registrant\u2019s application of internal carbon\n2795 See, e.g., letter from Bloomberg (stating \u201cscenario analysis is a useful tool to describe the resilience of a\ncompany\u2019s strategy to the risks and opportunities of climate change and to develop a more informed view\nof implications for enterprise value and value chains\u201d); see also supra notes 540-542 and accompanying\ntext; see also letter from Wellington (\u201c[i]nformation concerning scenario analysis would also help investors\nevaluate the resilience of the registrant\u2019s business strategy in the face of various climate scenarios that\ncould impose potentially different climate-related risks.\u201d).\n2796 See CDP, supra note 608.\n666\n\npricing and improve the transparency about the methodology underlying the use of internal\ncarbon pricing so that investors may better compare such use across registrants.\nIn addition to the general cost considerations discussed in section IV.C.1.b, these\nprovisions may have certain unintended effects on registrants and investors. In particular, as\nsome commenters noted, it is possible that requiring registrants to disclose specific facts about\ntheir use of transition plans, scenario analysis, and internal carbon prices to address climate-\nrelated risks could deter registrants from utilizing these methods or cause them to abandon them,\nfor example because of perceived litigation risk or because of the direct costs of preparing such\ndisclosure.2797 This could have negative consequences for investors if the use of these methods\nwould have helped registrants better manage climate-related risks and therefore make value-\nmaximizing decisions in light of those risks. However, if registrants\u2019 use of these methods\nbecomes a common practice,2798 due to investor demand or otherwise, this deterrence effect is\nlikely to be limited.\nThere are potential costs that could result from scenario analysis disclosures under the\nfinal rules. First, commenters expressed concern that the disclosure of the scenario analysis\nresults could confuse investors to the extent they inadvertently suggest that the chance of a loss\noccurring due to a rare event is more likely.2799 The commenters\u2019 concern could materialize if,\nfor instance, a scenario analysis suggests a heightened risk of a once-in-a-hundred-year flood\nover the next 30 years, and disclosure of this causes certain investors, particularly those not\n2797 See, e.g., letters from OMERS; Cemex; and NAM.\n2798 See, e.g., Climate Action 100+, Progress Update 2022 (2022), available at\nhttps://www.climateaction100.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/CA-100-Progress-Update-2022-FINAL-\n2.pdf (stating that \u201c91% of focus companies have now aligned with TCFD recommendations, either by\nsupporting the TCFD principles or by employing climate scenario planning\u201d).\n2799 See, e.g., letter from the BPI.\n667\n\nfamiliar with such analysis, not to invest in the registrant despite the fact that the registrant\nactually has the same risk profile as other companies that have not made this disclosure.\nHowever, we expect any potential investor confusion in such a case will be mitigated because,\nunder the final rules, the registrant would not be required to disclose this information if it\ndetermines that this scenario, like other very remote scenarios, are not likely to have a material\nimpact on its business or financial condition. In addition, when disclosure is required,\ninformation accompanying the scenario analysis results\u2014such as the assumptions and\nparameters underlying the analysis\u2014should help provide investors the necessary context for\nunderstanding the import of the disclosed analysis.2800 Second, in disclosing scenario analysis\nassumptions and inputs as well as information about internal carbon prices, a registrant may face\ncompetitive harm to the extent that the disclosures reveal competitively sensitive information,\nsuch as asset allocation decisions. However, we expect that the degree of flexibility offered by\nthe disclosure requirements in the final rules will help avoid the exposure of confidential or\nproprietary information, though they may make the disclosures less comparable.\nOverall, by focusing on climate-related risks that are material to the registrant\u2019s business,\nthe final rules seek to avoid imposing costs associated with disclosing large amounts of detailed\ninformation that may be less relevant to investors. Finally, some of the required disclosures\n(e.g., forward-looking statements concerning transition plans, scenario analysis, and internal\ncarbon pricing) will be subject to PSLRA safe harbors, which may reduce litigation costs where\nthe safe harbors are applicable.2801\n2800 We note that other disclosure requirements, such as those relating to market risk disclosures, convey to\ninvestors complex information about uncertain future risks that registrants face.\n2801 See supra section II.J.3 for a discussion of the disclosures required under the final rules that will be subject\nto PSLRA safe harbors. See also 17 CFR 229.1507.\n668\n\nc. Governance Disclosure\nThe final rules require a registrant to disclose information concerning the board\u2019s\noversight of climate-related risks as well as management\u2019s role in assessing and managing the\nregistrant\u2019s material climate-related risks.2802 The final rules require a registrant to identify, if\napplicable, any board committee or subcommittee responsible for the oversight of climate-related\nrisks and to describe the processes by which the board or such committee or subcommittee is\ninformed about such risks. Additionally, if there is a disclosed climate-related target or goal or\ntransition plan, the registrant must describe whether and how the board oversees progress against\nthe target or goal or transition plan. In describing management\u2019s role in assessing and managing\nthe registrant\u2019s material climate-related risks, the registrant should address, as applicable, the\nfollowing non-exclusive list of disclosure items: (1) whether and which management positions or\ncommittees are responsible for assessing and managing climate-related risks and the relevant\nexpertise of the position holders or committee members; (2) the processes by which such\npositions or committees assess and manage climate-related risks; and (3) whether such positions\nor committees report information about such climate-related risks to the board of directors or a\ncommittee or subcommittee of the board of directors. Like other parts of the final rules, these\nprovisions provide some flexibility for registrants to tailor their disclosures to suit their particular\nfacts and circumstances while helping to ensure that investors receive information regarding the\nboard\u2019s and management\u2019s role in addressing and managing climate-related risks.2803\n2802 See 17 CFR 229.1501.\n2803 See, e.g., letters from Wellington (\u201cThe proposed enhancements to disclosure on governance would help\ninvestors assess whether the issuer is appropriately considering risks and provide investors with valuable\ninformation about how the issuer plans to address these risks. This disclosure, in turn, gives investors\ninsight into potential future capital allocation, expansion plans, and potential vulnerabilities associated with\nthe issuer\u2019s business model (e.g., significant exposure to the impact of a carbon price).\u201d); and Institute of\n669\n\nThe disclosures required by the final rules will enable investors to better understand how\nthe company\u2019s leadership (i.e., its board of directors and management) is informed about\nclimate-related risks and how the company\u2019s leadership considers such factors as part of its\nbusiness strategy, risk management, and financial oversight. Managers and directors typically\nplay a key role in identifying and addressing these risks.2804 Commenters stated that\ngovernance-focused information on how such risks are being overseen by the board is\n\u201cfundamental\u201d for investors, and supported \u201cfull disclosure with respect to how and to whom\nwithin the company's organization accountability for climate-related risks is assigned\u201d so that\ninvestors may assess a registrant\u2019s risk management systems in this context.2805 The disclosures\nrequired by the final rules will inform investors about whether the organization has assigned\nclimate-related responsibilities to management-level positions and/or to the board and, if so,\nwhether those responsibilities include assessing and/or managing climate-related risks. As a\nresult, investors will be better able to understand and evaluate the processes, if any, by which the\nregistrant assesses and manages material climate-related risks.\nInformation regarding whether and how the board oversees progress on material climate-\nrelated targets or goals or transition plans will provide useful context for the final rules\u2019 other\nInternal Auditors (\u201cThe board is accountable for the success of the organization and needs assurance from\nan independent source to fulfill its duties\u2026. Effective governance inspires stakeholders\u2019 confidence and\ntrust that a company\u2019s decisions, actions, and outcomes can address priorities and achieve the\norganization\u2019s desired purpose.\u201d).\n2804 See Henry He Huang, Joseph Kerstein, Chong Wang & Feng Wu, Firm Climate Risk, Risk Management,\nand Bank Loan Financing, 43 Strategic Management Journal 2849 ((June 2022); see also Walid Ben\u2010Amar\n& Philip McIlkenny, Board Effectiveness and the Voluntary Disclosure of Climate Change Information, 24\nBusiness Strategy and the Environment 704 (2015).\n2805 See, e.g., letter from Canadian Coalition for Good Governance (noting that \u201cIf a company cannot articulate\nhow material climate-related risks are identified and clearly integrated into its governance philosophy and\napproach, this is a significant red flag for investors.\u201d); see also GHGSAT who state that \u201cA challenge to the\nimplementation of the TCFD framework has been a lack of education on the topic at the board level and a\nshortage of time for boards to consider the issues.\u201d\n670\n\ntargets or goals or transition plan disclosure requirements. Researchers have found that oversight\nsystems at the board level can provide an important signal about how directors of the registrants\nrecognize and address relevant climate-related risks.2806\nThe final rules require disclosure of board-level governance, if any, of climate-related\nrisks irrespective of the materiality of those risks. This disclosure will allow investors to\nunderstand whether climate-risks are among those that are significant enough to be considered at\nthe board level and how management and the board collectively oversee such risks. Regardless\nof the potential impact of such risks to the company, the decision to oversee climate-related risks\nat the board level as opposed to delegating entirely to management can provide useful\ninformation for understanding the company\u2019s overall approach to risk management and how\nclimate-related risks factor into such processes.\nCommenters asserted that the proposed rules may disproportionally burden small\nregistrants that may not have the internal management organizations and processes in place to\nassess and manage climate-related risks.2807 This provision of the final rules does not require\nregistrants to disclose any information when such internal management organizations and\nprocesses are absent. In these cases, registrants will not incur any direct costs associated with\nproducing these disclosures. As with any other disclosure requirement, smaller registrants that\nare required to disclose governance information under the final rules may be disproportionally\naffected in terms of costs relative to larger registrants because of the direct fixed costs associated\nwith producing disclosure.\n2806 V. Ramani & B. Ward, How Board Oversight Can Drive Climate and Sustainability Performance, 31 J. of\nApplied Corp. Fin. 80 (2019).\n671\n\nFinally, we recognize that the disclosure requirements may either prompt or deter\ncompanies from overseeing climate-related risks at the board or management level. To the\nextent that the final rules lead companies to alter their governance structures in ways that are less\nefficient (e.g., by diverting board or management attention from other pressing corporate matters\nor devoting internal resources and expertise to climate-related risks at the expense of other\nconcerns), investors could incur costs in the form of diminished shareholder value. One\ncommenter noted that the adverse effects could be particularly pronounced for smaller registrants\nthat may be less likely to have internal management organizations and processes in place to\nassess and manage climate-related risks.2808 We acknowledge these potential costs but also note\nthat several changes from the proposal help to mitigate such effects. For example, by adopting\nless prescriptive disclosure requirements compared to the those in the proposal and only\nrequiring disclosure of management\u2019s role in overseeing material climate related risks, the final\nrules are less likely to have such unintended effects on the registrant\u2019s governance structure and\nprocesses. Finally, we reiterate that the final rules are focused on disclosure and do not require\nregistrants to change their governance or other business practices.\nOther commenters expressed concern that the proposed requirement to disclose board\nmembers\u2019 climate expertise would impose costs by placing pressure on registrants to fill limited\nnumbers of board seats with individuals with a narrow skillset, rather than those with wide\nranging expertise or skillsets that may be better suited to the company\u2019s needs.2809 Some\ncommenters also noted the limited number of climate-risk experts compared to the demand for\nsuch individuals for board seats, which could increase costs for registrants that feel pressured to\n2808 See letter from Chamber.\n2809 See supra note 637 and accompanying text.\n672\n\nappoint climate-risk experts to the board as a result of the final rules.2810 Similar concerns were\nraised with respect to the proposed requirement to disclose management\u2019s relevant expertise.2811\nIn light of the comments, the Commission is not requiring the disclosure of board expertise. We\nare, however, adopting the requirement to disclose the relevant expertise of management to\nprovide investors with useful information about the expertise of those responsible for identifying\nmaterial climate risks and communicating those risks to the board.2812 We acknowledge the\nincremental cost of making this disclosure and the potential for indirect costs if registrants decide\nto hire climate experts in response to the disclosure requirement. While acknowledging these\ncosts, we reiterate that the Commission remains agnostic about whether and/or how registrants\ngovern climate-related risks. Registrants remain free to establish or retain the procedures and\npractices that they determine best fit their business. Overall, we agree with commenters that\nstated that investors will benefit from this disclosure given the direct role that management plays\nin overseeing any material climate-related risks.2813\nd. Targets and Goals Disclosure\nThe final rules will require a registrant to disclose any climate-related target or goal if\nsuch target or goal has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the\nregistrant\u2019s business, results of operations, or financial condition.2814 Under the final rules, a\nregistrant must provide any additional information or explanation necessary to an understanding\nof the material impact or reasonably likely material impact of the target or goal, including, as\n2810 See, e.g., supra note 650.\n2811 See, e.g., supra note 695 and accompanying text.\n2812 See supra section II.E.2.c.\n2813 See section II.E.2.ii.\n2814 See 17 CFR 229.1504.\n673\n\napplicable, a description of: (1) the scope of activities included in the target; (2) the unit of\nmeasurement; (3) the defined time horizon by which the target is intended to be achieved and\nwhether the time horizon is based on goals established by a climate-related treaty, law,\nregulation, policy, or organization; (4) if the registrant has established a baseline for the target or\ngoal, the defined baseline time period and the means by which progress will be tracked; and (5) a\nqualitative description of how the registrant intends to meet these climate-related targets or goals.\nRegistrants are also required to provide certain information if carbon offsets or RECs have been\nused as a material component of a registrant\u2019s plan to achieve climate-related targets or goals.\nFurthermore, registrants must disclose any progress made toward meeting the target or goal, how\nany such progress has been achieved, any material impacts to the registrant\u2019s business, results of\noperations, or financial condition as a direct result of the target or goal (or actions taken to make\nprogress toward meeting the target or goal), and include quantitative and qualitative disclosure of\nany material expenditures and material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions as a\ndirect result of the target or goal (or actions taken to make progress toward meeting the target or\ngoal). This disclosure must be updated each fiscal year by describing the actions taken during\nthe year to achieve its targets or goals.2815\nThe final rules will help investors to understand how a registrant\u2019s target or goal impacts\nits business and financial condition. Such disclosure will enable investors to better understand\nthe costs associated with pursuing these objectives as well as the benefits associated with\nachieving them. While some registrants may currently provide disclosure about their climate-\nrelated targets or goals, those voluntary disclosures generally do not provide investors with an\n2815 As with forward-looking statements concerning transition plans, scenario analysis, and internal carbon\npricing, forward-looking statements related to targets and goals will be covered by the PSLRA safe harbor,\nwhich may reduce litigation costs.\n674\n\nunderstanding of whether and how the climate-related targets or goals materially impact or are\nreasonably likely to materially impact the registrant\u2019s business, results of operations, or financial\ncondition. In addition, without a requirement to disclose material targets or goals, investors have\nno way of knowing if there are nonpublic targets or goals that could be relevant to their\ninvestment decisions, or if the registrant has simply not set any such targets or goals.\nFurthermore, voluntary disclosures about climate-related targets or goals are often missing key\npieces of information that investors need to understand them, such as the plan for achieving\nthem.2816 The final rules will address these knowledge gaps by supplementing the existing\npublicly available information.\nThe final rules will allow for greater comparability across registrants. However, we\nrecognize that the requirement to disclose targets and goals may prompt registrants to forgo\nestablishing targets or goals that may be or may become material in order to avoid the disclosure\nrequirements. This effect may be mitigated to the extent that registrants also consider other\nfactors (e.g., investor demand) for having or not having climate-related targets and goals when\nmaking such decisions.\nThe greater transparency from the required disclosure of specific details related to these\ntargets and goals in Commission filings may help alleviate concerns regarding the issue of\ngreenwashing in existing voluntary disclosures, as noted by commenters.2817 Academic studies\nhave found that existing information about climate-related targets and goals can suffer from\nconsiderable imprecision and inaccuracy despite efforts by certain organizations to create more\n2816 See, e.g., Kenji Watanabe, Antonios Panagiotopoulos & Siyao He, Assessing Science-Based Corporate\nClimate Target-Setting, (June 9, 2023), at Appendix 4, available at https://www.msci.com/www/research-\nreport/assessing-science-based/03881548607.\n2817 See, e.g., letters from D. Hileman Consulting; and Sen. Schatz et al.\n675\n\naccountability and transparency.2818 As a result, under the current voluntary framework,\ninvestors may not be able to distinguish between targets and goals that are material and those that\nare more akin to puffery and are unlikely to be material to a registrant. For example, disclosures\nthat explicitly link a target to a material impact on a registrant\u2019s financial condition will both\ninform investors about the potential costs and benefits of the target, while also lending credibility\ntowards the registrant\u2019s efforts to achieve the target. Thus, by requiring disclosures about\nmaterial targets and goals in Commission filings, the final rules should enhance the reliability\nand utility of such information for investors.2819 In addition, since any greenwashing under the\ncurrent voluntary disclosure regime could lead investors to over- or under-estimate the potential\nimpact of targets or goals on a registrant\u2019s business strategy, results of operations, or financial\nconditions, the disclosures required by the final rules will further enable investors to draw more\ninformed conclusions about how targets and goals may impact the business.\nWe are not adopting the proposed requirement to disclose metrics quantifying a\nregistrant\u2019s progress towards its target or goal. By not requiring registrants to provide\nquantification of its targets and goals metrics, we avoid some of the cost concerns raised by\ncomments associated with such disclosure, including Scope 3 emissions disclosures and other\npotentially difficult-to-calculate metrics.2820 Nevertheless, we expect the final rules to result in\nsome costs associated with developing systems for measuring progress made on targets or goals\nbecause registrants may still have to track their progress for purposes of providing the required\n2818 See, e.g., Bingler et al.; see also Memorandum Concerning Staff Meeting with Representatives of South\nPole (Jan. 14, 2022) (\u201cSouth Pole Memo\u201d).\n2819 See, e.g., letter from Center Amer. Progress (\u201cDisclosures around management\u2019s plans to address climate\nrisks, including how management is meeting or not meeting the targets or goals in those plans, are essential\nfor investors and other market participants.\u201d).\n2820 See section II.H.2. As noted above, the final rules will not require disclosure of Scope 3 emissions\ninformation, including in the context of a registrant\u2019s targets or goals.\n676\n\ndisclosures, if they do not already have those processes in place. Further, the final rules\u2019 more\nflexible approach may limit the usefulness of targets and goals disclosures relative to the\nproposed rules. In particular, if a registrant provides boilerplate qualitative disclosures, then it\nwould be harder for investors to assess the disclosures\u2019 credibility. However, the final rules\nrequirement to provide quantitative and qualitative disclosures of material expenditures and\nmaterial impacts on financial estimates and assumptions related to targets and goals will mitigate\nthis concern to some extent. This disclosure will also inform investors about the financial\nimplications of pursuing these targets and goals. For instance, investment in achieving targets\ncould be value-enhancing in the long run but reduce cash flow in the short run. By facilitating a\nbetter understanding of these impacts, investors will be better positioned to value companies and\nmake investment and voting decisions.\nQuantitative disclosures of expenditures and impacts may facilitate comparisons across\nregistrants; although, as noted in section IV.C.2.b above, the comparability benefits of this\nquantitative disclosure depend on the degree of variation in management determinations of\nwhich portion of their expenditures can be directly attributable to targets and goals. In addition,\nas discussed above, these disclosures may lead some registrants to report figures that overstate\nthe impact of targets and goals (if, for example, the registrant determines not to deduct the\nportion of expenditures that are unrelated to pursuit of the target or goal). However, we expect\nthat accompanying qualitative discussion should provide investors the context necessary to draw\ninformed conclusions.\nIn a change from the proposal, the final rules do not require disclosure of interim targets\nset by the registrant. Rather, registrants have flexibility to determine whether to disclose their\n677\n\ninterim targets, if any, in describing their plans to achieve their targets and goals or in the context\nof describing their progress towards such targets or goals.\nIf carbon offsets or RECs have been used as a material component of a registrant\u2019s plan\nto achieve climate-related targets or goals, the final rules require registrants to separately disclose\nthe amount of carbon avoidance, reduction, or removal represented by the offsets or the amount\nof generated renewable energy represented by the RECs, the nature and source of the offsets or\nRECs, a description and location of the underlying projects, any registries or other authentication\nof the offsets or RECs, and the costs of the offsets or RECs. Describing the features of RECs\nwill help investors understand how registrants are managing their climate-related risks.2821 For\nexample, one commenter said that \u201cnot all offsets or RECs are equal\u201d and that information on\nRECs would \u201callow investors to better assess the use of capital, the integrity and validity of such\noffsets or RECs, and the degree that the registrants emissions profile and offsets or RECs could\nbe at risk due to policy or regulation changes.\u201d2822 These disclosures also will provide context\nfor any required disclosures of Scope 1 or Scope 2 GHG emissions (i.e., if such emissions are\nmaterial for an LAF or an AF). In addition, more complete disclosures about carbon offsets and\nRECs may help deter potential greenwashing that results from a lack of reliable basic\ninformation. Because these disclosures comprise basic facts associated with the registrant\u2019s\npurchased carbon offsets and RECs, we do not expect that collecting and reporting this\ninformation will constitute a significant burden.\n2821 See, e.g., letters from AllianceBernstein; Carbon Direct; CarbonPlan; and Ceres.\n2822 See letter from CalPERS.\n678\n\ne. GHG Emissions Metrics\nThe final rules will require LAFs and AFs (that are not SRCs or EGCs) to disclose Scope\n1 and/or Scope 2 emissions, if such emissions are material, for their most recently completed\nfiscal year and, to the extent previously disclosed in a Commission filing, for the historical fiscal\nyear(s) included in the consolidated financial statements in the filing.2823 By specifying that\nthese registrants must provide information on material GHG emissions, the final rules will give\ninvestors access to a more comprehensive set of emissions data than under the baseline.\nInvestors can use this data to assess exposures to certain types of climate-related risks and\nprovide quantitative contextual data to supplement a registrant\u2019s description of the material\nclimate-related risks it faces, as well as progress on the management of those risks, as a part of\nassessing the registrant\u2019s overall business and financial condition. Because the value of a\ncompany\u2019s equity is derived from expected future cash flows, disclosure of GHG emissions can\nhelp investors understand whether those emissions are likely to subject the registrant to a\ntransition risk that will materially impact its business, results of operations, or financial condition\nin the short- or long-term and incorporate risks associated with such future cash flows into asset\nvalues today. Indeed, academic literature shows that risks both in the near term and far into the\nfuture are priced into current asset valuations.2824 Thus, for many registrants, GHG emissions\n2823 See 17 CFR 229.1505.\n2824 For evidence that points to the pricing of short-term climate-related risks, see R. Faccini, R. Matin & G.\nSkiadopoulos, Dissecting Climate Risks: Are They Reflected in Stock Prices? 155 J. of Banking & Fin.,\nArticle 106948 (Oct. 2023); Huynh & Xia (2021). For evidence that points to the pricing of long-term\nclimate-related risks, see M. Painter, An Inconvenient Cost: The Effects of Climate Change on Municipal\nBonds, 135 J. of Fin. Econ. 468 (2020); D.D. Nguyen, S. Ongena, S. Qi & V. Sila, Climate Change Risk\nand the Cost of Mortgage Credit, 26 Rev. of Fin. 1509 (2022); Huynh & Xia (2021).\n679\n\ncan be helpful to assess the registrants\u2019 exposure to climate-related risks, particularly to material\ntransition risks.2825\nAs noted in section IV.A, many registrants currently do not provide quantitative\ndisclosures on their Scope 1 and 2 emissions. This lack of information on emissions makes it\nmore difficult for investors to assess the degree of risk in individual companies, to compare those\nrisks across companies, and to value securities. By requiring disclosure of GHG emissions for\nspecified registrants for the same historical periods as those included in the financial statements\nin the relevant filing, the final rules will help investors develop a more accurate assessment of\nthose registrants\u2019 exposure and approach to climate-related risks over time. For example, Scope\n1 and Scope 2 emissions disclosure may be relevant to investors\u2019 assessment of a registrant\u2019s\nprogress made on targets or goals or towards its transition plan.2826\nThe final rules will provide informational benefits beyond those associated with the\nvoluntary disclosure of emissions that may be found in sustainability reports or other places,\nsuch as company websites. In particular, the overall mix of information disclosed to the market\ncan be distorted when only a certain subset of companies (e.g., those with lower emissions or\nthose that face lower costs of emissions measurement) have stronger incentives to make\nvoluntary disclosures. The final rules may offset this distortion because disclosure is only\nrequired if a registrant determines that its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions are material. The\n2825 See letters from CALSTRS; Vanguard; Fidelity; BlackRock; CALPERS; and State of NY Office of the\nComptroller.\n2826 Research has shown that issuers tend to \u201ccherry-pick\u201d the baseline year (i.e., pick the year with highest\nemissions within the past few years) when forming an emissions target so that any progress appears in the\nmost favorable light. See P. Bolton & M. Kacperczyk, Firm Commitments, National Bureau of Economic\nResearch, No. w31244 (May 2023). The final rules will thus benefit investors by helping them identify\nwhen such cherry-picking occurs so as to arrive at a more informed assessment about the registrant\u2019s\nprogress towards meeting its targets or goals.\n680\n\nmateriality qualifier will allow registrants that determine that their emissions are immaterial to\navoid the full costs of emissions measurement and disclosure. It will also mitigate the risk that\ninvestors could be burdened with large amounts of information that is less relevant for their\ninvestment and voting decisions. In addition, mandatory disclosure of Scope 1 and Scope 2\nemissions data in Commission filings may deter potential greenwashing that could occur with\nvoluntary disclosures.2827\nSome commenters questioned the value of GHG disclosures in light of existing\nrequirements for some registrants to report emissions pursuant to the GHGRP.2828 As previously\ndiscussed,2829 the data available from the GHGRP is generally not suited to help investors\nunderstand how a registrant\u2019s exposure and approach to managing climate-related risks may\nimpact its future cash flows and profitability for several reasons. First, the GHGRP requires that\nemissions are reported at the facility-level rather than the registrant-level. Second, suppliers of\ncertain products must report their \u201csupplied emissions,\u201d conditional on these emissions\nexceeding a specified threshold.2830 Third, GHGRP reporting is limited to U.S. facilities. Some\n2827 R. Yang, What Do We Learn from Ratings About Corporate Social Responsibility? New Evidence of\nUninformative Ratings, 52 J. of Fin.

Wilkens & J. Zink, Do Corporate Carbon Emissions Data Enable Investors to Mitigate\nClimate Change?, 48 J. of Portfolio Mgmt. 119 (2022) (\u201cKalesnik et al.\u201d).\n2828 See supra section IV.A.3 and letters from Chamber; Elaine Henry; BOK Financial; David R. Burton;\nPermian Basin; and Petroleum Association.\n2829 See supra section IV.A.3.\n2830 In addition, as previously discussed, the EPA emissions data only reflects a portion of emissions. See supra\nsection IV.A.3. The EPA\u2019s emissions data therefore presents challenges for investors to use, especially as\nthe data are made public by facility and not by company. While each facility is matched to its parent\ncompany, this company may not be the entity registered with the SEC and thus the reported information\nmay be less relevant to investors. See also letter from EPA (containing a tabular comparison of the EPA\ndisclosures to the proposed disclosures).\n681\n\ncommenters asserted that the GHGRP could not be substituted for the proposed rules given the\ndifferent disclosure requirements and the different objectives of the two reporting regimes.2831\nWhile there are differences between the EPA\u2019s GHGRP and the Scope 1 and 2 emissions\ndisclosures in the final rules, we expect that registrants subject to both reporting regimes would\nface reduced costs of compliance with the final rules to the extent there is overlap between the\nreporting requirements of the GHGRP and the final rules. As discussed in section IV.A, the\nGHGRP covers 85 to 90 percent of all GHG emissions in the U.S. and includes those emissions\nreferenced by the GHG Protocol and included in the final rules\u2019 definition of \u201cgreenhouse\ngasses.\u201d2832 As such, we expect that entities subject to the GHGRP disclosure and reporting\nrequirements may consequently have lower incremental information gathering costs under the\nfinal rules for those emissions already required to be calculated and reported by a registrant\npursuant to the GHGRP. For example, because both the GHGRP and the final rules require\ncompanies to collect information to report and disclose their Scope 1 emissions, to the extent that\nthe information and reporting activities overlap, registrants subject to both the final rules and the\nGHGRP may face lower incremental information gathering costs. However, as one commenter\nnoted, \u201c[t]he Commission-proposed regulation is not completely in alignment with the US EPA\nregulation. Thus, an assessment, plan of action, and implementation of changes will be needed\nfor many companies to be compliant with the requirements of both agencies.\u201d2833 In addition as\nnoted above, this lower incremental cost would only apply to direct emissions from U.S.-based\nfacilities, not registrants\u2019 international facilities or operations.\n2831 See, e.g., letters from EPA; and Marathon Oil.\n2832 See supra section IV.A.3.\n2833 Letter from Marathon Oil.\n682\n\nLimiting the disclosure requirement to larger companies (i.e., those with greater resources\nthat tend to be already calculating emissions, as noted in section IV.A) will help to balance the\nconcerns of commenters who stated that the evolving nature of current emissions measurement\ntechnologies could impose significant compliance costs on registrants, especially those not\ncurrently familiar with reporting this information.2834\nAlthough the final rules limit disclosures to circumstances in which emissions are\nmaterial for registrants, we expect most, if not all, LAFs and AFs that are not EGCs or SRCs will\nneed to assess or estimate their Scope 1 and 2 emissions to reach a materiality determination. As\na result, we expect these registrants will, to some extent, need to adopt controls and procedures\nto assess the materiality of their Scope 1 and 2 emissions and determine whether disclosure is\nrequired if they do not already have them in place. Registrants that determine that their Scope 1\nand 2 emissions are material may likewise need to adopt further controls and procedures,\nincluding measurement technologies and other tools to track and report the information to the\nextent they do not already do so. The final rules may also affect registrants that currently track\nand/or report this information.2835 For example, some registrants may only be measuring some\nScope 1 or Scope 2 emissions.2836 Any investments in systems or technologies to better measure\n2834 See letters from Blackrock; Business Roundtable; and Chevron. See also Kalesnik, et al., supra note 2827.\n2835 As we discuss below, the costs for existing registrants who track and disclose emissions will be limited\nbecause the final rules enable registrants to continue to use the operational and organizational boundaries\nthey already use to track emissions.\n2836 See Kalesnik, et al., supra note 2827 (noting that many registrants do not fully measure their Scope 1\nemissions).\n683\n\nScope 1 and Scope 2 emissions will improve the quality of available data2837 on emissions but\nwill also contribute to the direct costs of compliance.2838\nThe benefits of this component of the final rules depend on the extent to which Scope 1\nand 2 emissions disclosures are accurate and thus provide reliable reflections of registrants\u2019\nexposure to material climate-related risks, their management of that risk, and their progress on\ntransition plans and/or targets and goals (to the extent they have them). Several commenters\nnoted that many registrants have had more experience measuring and disclosing Scope 1 and 2\nemissions than Scope 3 emissions, and that those methodologies, from their experiences, are\nwell-established and are considered fairly robust.2839 Nevertheless, according to studies as well\nas commenter feedback, there may be issues with errors and inconsistencies in voluntary Scope 1\nand 2 emissions disclosures.2840 The final rules will benefit investors by improving the accuracy\nand reliability of this information\u2014first through requiring registrants to subject GHG emissions\ndisclosures, to the extent they are required to make them, to disclosure controls and procedures;\nand second, by requiring assurance. The final rules also permit the disclosure of reasonable\nestimates for Scope 1 and 2 emissions provided that such estimates are accompanied by\n2837 A number of studies have raised concerns about the quality of existing emissions data. For example, one\nstudy found that third-party estimates of emissions, which represent a significant fraction of the emissions\ndata available in several existing databases, are materially less accurate than self-reported emissions data by\nissuers. See Kalesnik et al., supra note 2827. Another study examined emissions data reported to CDP\nbetween 2010 and 2019 and found that 38.9% of the reports exhibited disparities between the reported total\nemissions and sum of reported emissions by various sub-categories. See S. Garcia-Vega, A.G. Hoepner, J.\nRogelj & F. Schiemann, Abominable Greenhouse Gas Bookkeeping Casts Serious Doubts On Climate\nIntentions of Oil and Gas Companies (working paper, Mar. 2023), available at\nhttps://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4451926 (retrieved from SSRN Elsevier database).\n2838 See sections IV.C.1.b and IV.C.3 for additional information on the associated compliance costs.\n2839 See letters from National Retail Federation; AHLA; and Aerospace Industries Association.\n2840 See Kalesnik et al., supra note 2827; Garcia-Vega et al., supra note 2837; see also letter from Calvert\n(\u201cResearch demonstrates about 30% of companies that disclose such information in their own reporting\nmake errors on a regular to periodic basis, despite the well-established rules and systems that already exist\nto ensure proper reporting of such emissions. In many cases, this appears to stem from a lack of effective\ninternal controls or well-functioning monitoring systems.\u201d).\n684\n\ndisclosure of underlying assumptions and reasons for using estimates, which will help investors\nbetter understand the metrics that registrants are disclosing.\nScope 1 and 2 emissions may not fully reflect a registrant\u2019s exposure to transition risks\nbecause some of those risks would only be captured through other metrics such as Scope 3\nemissions.2841 For example, registrants facing similar exposure to emissions-related climate\nrisks may report different Scope 2 emissions levels depending on, for example, whether they pay\ndirectly for their utilities (counted as Scope 2) or their leases provide for utilities expenses\n(counted as Scope 3), or, as another example, whether they have employees who work from\nhome and therefore who do not contribute directly to utilities expenses. Recognizing these\nlimitations, the final rules also require disclosures on methodology, significant inputs, significant\nassumptions, organizational boundaries, operational boundaries, and reporting standard used\nwith respect to Scope 1 and 2 emissions. These disclosures will provide additional context to\nhelp investors understand the disclosures and will enable investors to draw more reliable\ncomparisons across registrants. For example, disclosure of operational boundaries will help\ndistinguish registrants that rely on utilities provided by third parties from those that pay directly\nfor their utilities, which will assist investors in accounting for this difference when comparing\nreported emissions and thus climate-related risk across registrants.\nIn a change from the proposal, we are exempting SRCs and EGCs from the GHG\nemissions disclosure requirements in order to limit the costs of this disclosure requirement for\nsuch registrants. This exemption should also mitigate the risk of deterring prospective EGCs or\nSRCs from conducting IPOs or inducing EGCs or SRCs to deregister under the Exchange Act as\na result of the costs associated with compliance with the requirements to disclose material\n2841 See letters from Wellington; and Calvert.\n685\n\nScopes 1 and 2 emissions. Registrants that already measure their GHG emissions tend to be\nlarger companies (with greater exposure to various climate-related transition risks by virtue of\ntheir size and economic footprint) as observed in our own baseline analysis (see Table 5) and in\nthe assessments of commenters, many of whom supported exemptions for SRCs and EGCs as\nthey would be disproportionately impacted by the requirement.2842 While these exemptions may\nlimit the benefit of achieving greater consistency and comparability across registrants, exempting\nSRCs and EGCs from this disclosure requirement at this time is appropriate given the relatively\nlarger burden GHG emissions reporting requirements could have on these firms2843 and the\ndifferences in the existing levels of climate-related disclosure between larger companies and\nsmaller companies.\nCommenters raised concerns about the costs of providing GHG emissions on a\ndisaggregated basis.2844 However, many commenters also explained that disaggregated\ndisclosures could be decision useful, as emissions from specific constituent gases could have\ndifferential effects on a company\u2019s cash flows or business operations.2845 For example, a\n2842 See, e.g., letters from U.S. SBA (\u201cSmall entities will need to allocate larger shares of their technological,\nfinancial, and staff resources to comply with the proposed rules. Representatives from the biotechnology,\nplastics, and equipment manufacturing industries have reported to Advocacy that small businesses in their\nindustries have not traditionally tracked GHG emissions or other climate-related metrics. These businesses\nwould either need to develop modeling software to track climate metrics in-house or hire third-party\nconsultants to do so \u2026 Small private companies have also voiced that the costs of collecting and analyzing\nGHG emissions data could be prohibitive.\u201d); Soros Fund (suggesting that EGCs and SRCs should be\nallowed additional time to adjust to climate disclosure requirements, be afforded an additional safe harbor\nand be exempt from financial statement metrics disclosure); and SBCFAC Recommendation\n(recommending \u201cscaling and delaying the compliance requirement for emerging growth companies, along\nwith smaller reporting companies.\u201d).\n2843 Even for SRCs and EGCs that are currently calculating GHG emissions, there could be certain fixed costs\nassociated with preparing this information for disclosure in Commission filings that would not scale with\nthe size of the registrant and would therefore be more burdensome to these entities. We expect benefits to\nscale with the size of the firm.\n2844 See, e.g., letters from ABA; ERM CVS; Sullivan Cromwell; and T. Rowe Price.\n2845 See, e.g., letters from PwC; and WRI.\n686\n\nregistrant may be subject to methane fees by the EPA, in which case information about the\nregistrant\u2019s methane emissions could factor into investors\u2019 decision making. To balance these\nviews, some commenters suggested that the final rules should require constituent gases to be\ndisclosed on a disaggregated basis only when individually material.2846 We agree with those\ncommenters and believe that this approach will provide investors with decision-useful\ninformation about GHG emissions without imposing undue compliance costs on registrants to\nproduce disaggregated data in circumstances in which the disaggregation may not be particularly\nuseful for investors.2847\nThe final rules also permit registrants to calculate and disclose GHG emissions according\nto the methodology that best matches their particular facts and circumstances. The benefit of this\nflexible approach is that registrants will have the opportunity to provide investors with\ninformation about their GHG emissions using the latest and most suitable methodology as\nmeasurement technologies and standards continue to develop. For example, while many\ncompanies calculate their GHG emissions pursuant to the GHG Protocol, others utilize different\napproaches, such as certain ISO standards.2848 This flexibility, which may include registrants\u2019\nability to round as appropriate, will serve to limit costs.2849 Conversely, it could also make\ncomparisons less straightforward, which may attenuate some of the expected benefits of the final\n2846 See, e.g., letter from Deloitte & Touche (\u201cMany emissions category calculation methods are estimate-based\nand rely on proxy data; the potential variance in actual can be significant and is largely unknown in many\ninstances. Especially given these challenges, the Commission may consider whether the disaggregated data\nby each constituent greenhouse gas should only be required to be disclosed when individually material.\u201d).\n2847 Id.\n2848 See letters from Futurepast (referencing ISO 14064-1, Specification with Guidance at the Organization\nLevel for Quantification and Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Statements; and ISO 14067, Carbon Footprint\nof Products\u2014Requirements and Guidelines for Quantification); and ISO Comm. GHG; see also, e.g.,\nletters from Alphabet et al.; As You Sow; Beller et al.; CalSTRS; CFA; Dell; Deloitte & Touche; Engine\nNo. 1; ERM CVS; KPMG; Morningstar; Soc. Corp. Gov.; and WRI.\n2849 See letter from AGs of TX et al.\n687\n\nrules. However, there are several reasons to believe that this reduction in comparability will not\nsignificantly undermine the utility of the required disclosures. First, the required disclosures will\nexpand upon and enhance the quality of the existing set of GHG emissions disclosures that\ninvestors already find useful despite the variation in methodologies that produce existing\nemission disclosures.2850 Second, the contextual disclosures (e.g., operational boundaries) will\nenable investors to better understand the quantitative disclosures and make adjustments to\nfacilitate comparisons with other registrants that are otherwise not possible under the baseline.\nThird, to the extent that industry-specific approaches to disclosing emissions continue to develop\nand evolve, the final rules will permit registrants within those industries to adopt those\napproaches, which will help investors to compare peer companies within an industry. Finally, as\nwe discuss in the next subsection, obtaining assurance over GHG emissions disclosure provides\ninvestors with an additional degree of reliability regarding not only the figures that are disclosed,\nbut also the key assumptions, methodologies, and data sources the registrant used to arrive at\nthose figures.\nThese disclosures complement the other required disclosures about the organizational\nboundaries (used to calculate emissions versus those used in their financial statements) as well as\ncarbon offsets and RECs, which offer important context for facilitating comparisons between\ncompanies as discussed above. In fact, by not requiring organizational boundaries to necessarily\nconform to those used in the company\u2019s consolidated financial statements, the final rules permit\nthe development of a standardized framework (e.g., control approach) for measuring emissions\nacross registrants. Commenters supported this approach as it would allow registrants to continue\n2850 See, e.g., letters from Vanguard; Fidelity; BlackRock; CALSTRS; and CALPERS for investors who derive\nutility from existing emissions disclosures.\n688\n\nto measure emissions using their current approach and procedures.2851 That is, by not imposing a\nprescriptive methodology for GHG emissions disclosures, the final rules provide space for the\ncontinued development of a shared reporting framework for issuers to disclose information that\nultimately may enhance the degree of comparability of registrant-level GHG emissions data, to\nthe benefit of investors, registrants and the market (relative to the baseline).2852\nFinally, as discussed in section II.I above, we are following the suggestions of many\ncommenters and allowing registrants more time to report emissions given the inherent challenges\nwith reporting sooner that commenters highlighted.2853 By delaying the requirement to disclose\nGHG emissions until later in the year, the final rules will provide additional time to prepare the\ninformation for filing (more consistent with current voluntary reporting practices),2854 which\nshould improve its accuracy and reduce costs for registrants but may result in delayed disclosure\nin some instances. The delay in annual reporting may also allow registrants to leverage\ndisclosures they may have already prepared for other reporting regimes. Nonetheless, even with\nthe extended filing deadline for registrants, investors will still benefit from receiving this\ninformation in a more timely and predictable manner than they currently do.2855\nf. Attestation Over GHG Emissions Disclosure\nThe proposed rules would have required LAFs and AFs to provide an attestation report\ncovering the disclosure of its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions at the limited assurance level for\n2851 See, e.g., letters from API; ACORE; AHLA; and Chevron.\n2852 See, e.g., letters from Alphabet et al.; and Alliance-Bernstein.\n2853 See, e.g., letters from Morningstar; and American Banker.\n2854 See, e.g., supra note 2570 (stating \u201cmany companies still take more than 12 months after their fiscal year to\ndisclose their sustainability data\u201d).\n2855 See, e.g., letter from Morningstar (\u201cCurrently, a lack of clear disclosure standards for the timing of\n\u2018sustainability reports,\u2019 which is the primary source for emissions data, greatly hinders investor knowledge.\nFor example, some registrants released 2021 reports\u2014detailing 2020 data\u2014as late as November 2021.\u201d).\n689\n\nthe second and third fiscal years after the Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosure compliance date,\nand at the reasonable assurance level beginning in fiscal year four. In a change from the\nproposal, the final rules require LAFs and AFs to provide an attestation report at the limited\nassurance level for Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions disclosures beginning the third fiscal year\nafter the compliance date for GHG emissions reporting and require an LAF to provide an\nattestation report at the reasonable assurance level for Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions\ndisclosures beginning the seventh fiscal year after the compliance date for GHG emissions\nreporting.2856\nMany commenters stated that the proposed assurance requirements would be too\ncostly.2857 In response to these commenters\u2019 concerns, and in a shift from the proposal, the final\nrules will exempt SRCs and EGCs from the requirement to obtain assurance, since SRCs and\nEGCs will not be required to disclose GHG emissions. In addition, the final rules do not require\nAFs to provide attestation reports at the reasonable assurance level. We have determined that it\nis appropriate to apply the reasonable assurance requirement to a more limited pool of\nregistrants\u2014LAFs\u2014at this time because a number of LAFs are already collecting and disclosing\nclimate-related information, including GHG emissions data and larger issuers generally bear\nproportionately lower compliance costs than smaller issuers due to the fixed cost components of\nsuch compliance.\n2856 See 17 CFR 229.1506.\n2857 See, e.g., letters from AFPM; AHLA; Amer. Chem.; Bipartisan Policy (\u201cWhile emissions data is no doubt\nimportant for companies to evaluate, especially those that are large emitters, attesting or certifying this data\nas accurate is far more costly than with financial data because the market for emissions is not at all well-\ndeveloped.\u201d); Eversource; Business Roundtable; Chamber; ConocoPhillips (\u201cthe availability of assurance\nproviders is currently insufficient to meet demand and will likely trigger a surge in costs\u201d); McCormick\n(\u201cWhile unknown at this time, due to the fact that these types of disclosures have never been required by\nthe SEC in the past and in this form, these added costs must be well understood and measured against the\nbenefit.\u201d); NOIA; PPL; SBCFAC Recommendation; SIFMA; Soc. Corp. Gov.; Sullivan Cromwell; and\nTravelers.\n690\n\nFor both LAFs and AFs, the extended phased in compliance dates will further address\nconcerns about the immediate costs of compliance under the final rules.2858 Specifically, the\nfinal rules provide registrants with two phased in compliance periods\u2014one phased in compliance\nperiod before GHG emissions disclosures are required, and another, later phased in compliance\nperiod before assurance over GHG emissions disclosures is required. These phased in\ncompliance periods will give registrants time to develop and implement processes and controls to\nproduce high quality GHG emissions data and disclosures. In addition, the phased in compliance\nperiods will provide existing GHG emissions assurance providers with time to train additional\nstaff and undertake other preparations for these engagements as necessary, as well as facilitate\nthe entry of new GHG emissions attestation providers into the market to meet demand.2859 As\nthe availability of assurance providers increases and the quality of registrants\u2019 reporting\nimproves, we expect the costs of assurance will decrease.\nMany commenters also pointed out the benefits of attestation reports covering the\ndisclosure of registrants\u2019 Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, including increased investor\nprotection2860 and mitigation against the risk of potential greenwashing.2861 Academic research\n2858 See letter from BOA (stating that a delay in the compliance date \u201cwould give additional time to attestation\nproviders to obtain the necessary staff and resources to meet future demand and could help to reduce costs\nfor registrants\u201d); see also letter from Corteva (stating that a minimum one-year extension to the\nimplementation deadlines set forth in the proposal \u201cwould reduce the risk of reporting delays, give\nregistrants further opportunities to improve data quality and internal control processes, and work with\nassurance providers to ensure a more productive assurance process\u201d).\n2859 There can be barriers to entry due to consolidation around a few major assurance providers. See Gipper et\nal. (2023); see also discussion of similar concerns raised in the context of recent California laws, discussed\ninfra note 3118 and accompanying text.\n2860 See, e.g., letters from Better Markets; CAQ; and SFERS.\n2861 See, e.g., letters from BNP Paribas; and UAW Retiree. In response to one commenter who asserted a lack\nof factual evidence on the extensiveness of greenwashing (see Overdahl exhibit to letter from Chamber),\nwe note that recent analysis shows greenwashing risk has accelerated. See RepRisk, On the Rise:\nNavigating the Wave of Greenwashing and Social Washing (Oct. 2023), available at\nhttps://www.reprisk.com/news-research/reports/on-the-rise-navigating-the-wave-of-greenwashing-and-\nsocial-washing.\n691\n\nshows that voluntary assurance improves the quality of GHG emissions disclosures and CSR\ndisclosures more generally,2862 and that investors perceive CSR disclosures to be more credible\nwhen they are accompanied by the assurance reports, regardless of the assurance level.2863\nBroadly, academic research also suggests that the market values voluntary audits2864 and due to\nthis demand firms voluntarily submit to audits.2865 Furthermore, practitioner evidence suggests\nthat the demand for voluntary ESG assurance is increasing.2866 And while some registrants may\nmeet this demand by obtaining voluntary assurance; others may not. Indeed, research shows that\nmany firms do not obtain voluntary assurance,2867 and that assurance provided on a voluntary\nbasis may vary widely in form and content.2868 Hence, we expect there to be benefits from\nrequiring LAFs and AFs to provide the attestation reports covering their Scope 1 and/or Scope 2\nemission disclosures.2869 The assurance requirement in the final rules will require an\n2862 See, e.g., letter from F.

See Bourveau, et al., supra note 2865; Gipper et al. (2023) also document that there is a\nheterogeneity of the types of metrics being voluntarily assured, depending on the type of the assuror.

Other commenters stated that they were opposed to the proposed assurance\nrequirements because the requirements would preclude assurance providers from applying the\nISO 14064-3 standards, which is the most common standard used by non-accountant assurance\nproviders.2874 As discussed in the baseline, most companies that currently obtain some type of\n2870 See, e.g., Casey, et al., supra note 1207 (finding that corporate social responsibility (\u201cCSR\u201d) assurance\nresults in lower cost-of-capital along with lower analyst forecast errors and dispersion, and that financial\nanalysts find related CSR reports to be more credible when independently assured).\n2871 See Overdahl exhibit to letter from Chamber; see also Charles H.

The final rules address these concerns by modifying\nthe requirements for the attestation standards such that an attestation report pursuant to the ISO\n14064-3 standards will satisfy the requirements in the final rule.\nCommenters also asserted that assurance standards and methodologies are still\nevolving.2876 Consistent with these commenters\u2019 assertions, prior research shows that the field\nof sustainability assurance\u2014which presumably encompasses the assurance over emissions\ndisclosures\u2014is fairly new and thus may not provide the same benefits as decades of financial\naudit practice.2877 While we acknowledge that the field of GHG emission assurance is still\n2875 While this is true in the U.S., we note that in Europe and other parts of the world, accountants are the\nprimary service provider.

These conditions will help ensure that any standards used for\nGHG assurance services under the final rules are sufficiently developed to provide meaningful\ninvestor protection benefits, while still providing a degree of flexibility to registrants given the\nemerging nature of GHG assurance services. In addition, the final rules include a longer phase in\nperiod before LAFs and AFs are required to comply with the assurance requirements, which also\nprovides additional time for standards and methodologies to further develop.\nThe final amendments also require the GHG emissions attestation report be prepared and\nsigned by a GHG emissions attestation provider who is an expert in GHG emissions by virtue of\nhaving significant experience in measuring, analyzing, reporting, or attesting to GHG emissions.\nThis provider must be independent with respect to the registrant, and any of its affiliates, for\nwhom it is providing the attestation report, during the attestation and professional engagement\nperiod.\nAssurance Services: A Comparison Between Italy and United States, 163 J. of Bus. Ethics 67 (2020).\nAcademic evidence also suggests that sustainability report restatements are positively associated with the\npresence of sustainability assurance reports. See G. Michelon, D.M. Patten & A.M. Romi, Creating\nLegitimacy for Sustainability Assurance Practices: Evidence from Sustainability Restatements,\n28 European Acct. Rev. 395 (2019).

Rev. 259 (2018) (finding misstatements are more likely in areas\nof reporting complexity).\n695\n\nThe final rule\u2019s expertise requirement for attestation providers should enhance the overall\nbenefits of obtaining GHG emissions assurance, consistent with academic research showing that\nindustry specialist auditors deliver higher quality financial statement audits than non-specialist\nauditors2878 and that audit clients are willing to pay more for audit services of more experienced\naudit partners.2879\nSimilarly, the final rules\u2019 independence requirement for attestation providers is consistent\nwith the similar requirement that has long existed for financial statement auditors and will\nenhance the perceived credibility of the GHG emissions assurance.2880 Attestation providers that\nare not accountants may incur additional costs to familiarize themselves with these requirements.\nThe final rules also require LAFs and AFs to disclose, after requesting relevant\ninformation from any GHG emissions attestation provider as necessary, whether the GHG\nemissions attestation provider is subject to any oversight inspection program, and if so, which\nprogram (or programs) and whether the GHG emissions attestation engagement is included\nwithin the scope of authority of such oversight inspection program. While the final rules do not\nrequire that the GHG emissions attestation provider be subjected to mandatory oversight and\ninspection processes, disclosure of whether this is the case will provide investors with a better\nunderstanding of the qualifications of the GHG emissions attestation provider, which in turn will\nhelp them determine whether the assurance services have enhanced the reliability of the GHG\n2878 See, e.g., K.J.

For example, academic research shows that oversight inspections of\nfinancial statement audits by the PCAOB have significantly increased the credibility of the\nfinancial statement audits.2881 Similarly, in the context of inspections of PCAOB-registered\npublic accounting firms, academic literature suggests that engagement-specific PCAOB\ninspections may have spillover effects on non-inspected engagements.2882\nFurthermore, the final rules require AFs and LAFs subject to Item 1506(a) to disclose\nwhether any GHG emissions attestation provider that was previously engaged to provide\nattestation over the registrant\u2019s GHG emissions disclosure for the fiscal year covered by the\nattestation report resigned (or indicated that it declined to stand for re-appointment after the\ncompletion of the attestation engagement) or was dismissed. If so, the registrant is required to\ndisclose certain information about whether there were any disagreements with the former GHG\nemissions attestation provider and to describe the disagreement. The registrant also must\ndisclose whether it has authorized the former GHG emissions attestation provider to respond\nfully to the inquiries of the successor GHG emissions attestation provider concerning the subject\nmatter of the disagreement. Due to the readily available nature of this information for\nregistrants, we do not expect that it would be costly for registrants to include these disclosures in\nthe filing that contains the GHG emissions disclosures and attestation report, when applicable.\n2881 See, e.g., B.

This disclosure\nrequirement also may limit a registrant\u2019s incentive to dismiss attestation providers that it views\nas unfavorable.2883\nIn addition, the final rules require any registrant that is not required to include a GHG\nemissions attestation report pursuant to Item 1506(a) to disclose certain information if the\nregistrant\u2019s GHG emissions disclosure were voluntarily subjected to third-party assurance, which\nis consistent with the proposed rules and with the feedback provided by several commenters.2884\nThere is some academic evidence suggesting that the assurance approaches of accountants and\nnon-accountants differ (thus potentially reducing comparability across what is being assured),2885\nthat firms choose accountants vs. non-accountants as their GHG emissions assurance providers\ndepending on their internal objectives,2886 and that market participants draw inferences from the\n2883 Registrants may have incentives to search for a favorable assurance conclusion or opinion, similar to those\npreviously documented in the market for credit ratings.

These concerns are mitigated to some extent with respect to liability under section\n11 of the Securities Act by the final rules\u2019 amendment to Rule 436, which provides that any\ndescription of assurance regarding a registrant\u2019s GHG emissions disclosures provided in\naccordance with Item 1506(e) (i.e., assurance voluntarily obtained over GHG emissions\ndisclosures) shall not be considered part of the registration statement prepared or certified by a\nperson within the meaning of sections 7 and 11 of the Securities Act.2889\n2887 G.

However, another study did not find that the investors cared\nwhether a sustainability assurance provider was affiliated with the audit profession or not (see, e.g., R.\nSimnett, A. Vanstraelen & W.F. Chua, Assurance on Sustainability Reports: An International Comparison,\n84 Acct. Rev. 937 (2009).\n2888 Academic research shows that the market trusts more voluntary disclosures by managers with established\nreputations for better accuracy or \u201cforthcomingness\u201d of such past disclosures. See, e.g., H.I. Yang, Capital\nMarket Consequences of Managers' Voluntary Disclosure Styles, 53 J. of Acct. and Econ. 167 (2012); A.\nBeyer & R.A.

Risk Management Disclosure\nThe final rules require a registrant to describe any processes it has for identifying,\nassessing, and managing material climate-related risks.2890 A registrant with such a process\nshould address, as applicable, the following non-exclusive list of disclosure items: (1) how it\nidentifies whether it has incurred or is reasonably likely to incur a material physical or transition\nrisk; (2) how it decides whether to mitigate, accept, or adapt to the particular risk; and (3) how it\nprioritizes whether to address the climate-related risk. Furthermore, the final rules specify that\nregistrants who manage a material climate-related risk must disclose whether and how their\nprocesses for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks have been integrated into\ntheir overall risk management system or processes.\nThese disclosures will allow investors to better assess the risk management processes\nregistrants use to evaluate and address material climate-related risks that may have or are\nreasonably likely to have an impact on companies\u2019 operations and financial conditions. Climate-\nrelated risks could impact companies\u2019 financial performance in a number of ways. For example,\nphysical risks could result in asset impairments and business interruptions. Regulatory changes\ncould render certain business plans less or unprofitable. Shifts in consumer preferences could\nincrease or decrease demand for certain types of products. While some of these risks may be\nrelatively straightforward to evaluate, others may require expertise and detailed knowledge about\na company\u2019s business partners and operations. The risk management disclosures in the final\nrules will provide investors with a more detailed understanding of how a registrants\u2019 risk\n2890 See 17 CFR 229.1503.\n700\n\nmanagement systems identify, evaluate, and address climate-related risks, which could\ncontribute to better-informed investment and voting decisions.2891\nAs one example of how investors could use risk management disclosure, one commenter\nexplained:\u201c[we] identified a semi-conductor manufacturer as a more attractive investment when\nwe learned it was diversifying its manufacturing locations to diversify its water sourcing.\u201d2892\nHowever, a commenter also noted that \u201c[f]or a significant number of issuers, information is not\nsufficient to support equivalent analysis.\u201d2893 In this respect, requiring a registrant to describe its\nprocess for identifying, assessing, and managing material climate-related risks, such as water\nsourcing risks, will allow investors to more fully evaluate the drivers and outcomes of the\nregistrant\u2019s risk management decisions. These disclosures will also benefit investors by\nproviding context for the other disclosures required by the final rules. For example, investors\ncan use these disclosures to better understand the steps a registrant took to identify material\nclimate-related risks in the context of the registrant\u2019s disclosures about the types of material\nclimate-related risks it faces.\nThe requirement to disclose the extent to which a registrant\u2019s processes for identifying,\nassessing, and managing climate-related risks have been integrated into its overall risk\n2891 See letters from the Investment Company Institute (\u201cWe also support companies being required to disclose\nwhether and how climate-related risks are integrated into the company\u2019s overall risk management system or\nprocesses. This disclosure should help investors assess how the company handles climate-related risk as\ncompared to other risks.\u201d); Vanguard (\u201cWe consider climate risks to be material and fundamental risks for\ninvestors and the management of those risks is important for price discovery and long-term shareholder\nreturns.\u201d); and Calvert (\u201cWe support the SEC\u2019s mandated approach for registrants to describe processes for\nidentifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks, including both physical and transition risks. In\norder for us to evaluate issuer risks properly, we need transparent disclosure that allows us to assess how\ncompanies are determining the materiality of climate-related risks, including how they measure the\npotential scope and impact of an identified climate-related risk and how the risks identified in the\ndisclosures relate back to that issuer\u2019s strategy, business model and outlook.\u201d).\n2892 See letter from Wellington.\n2893 Id.\n701\n\nmanagement system or processes provision will help investors understand and assess the\neffectiveness of those climate risk management processes.\nThere are many climate risk management approaches available to firm managers, ranging\nfrom divestment from certain suppliers to engagement with their business partners to hedging to\nincorporating climate risk into their financial planning.2894 To the extent that there is variation in\nrisk management practices across registrants or such practices change over time, the final rules\nwill allow investors to compare those risk management practices when making investment\ndecisions.\nAs discussed in section IV.C.3, we expect registrants to incur some additional\ncompliance costs as a result of these disclosures; however, to limit the costs associated with these\ndisclosures, we are not requiring several of the prescriptive elements found in the proposed rules,\nincluding a separate disclosure item on how a registrant determines how to mitigate any high\npriority risks.2895 While these disclosures may have been low cost to produce for some\nregistrants that already create TCFD-compliant sustainability reports, we opted for a more\nflexible approach for the reasons discussed above. In providing that registrants only need to\ndescribe the process for identifying, assessing, and managing material climate-related risks, the\nfinal rules further limit the compliance costs for registrants. Nonetheless, registrants may still\n2894 See, e.g., Keely Bosn, Amelia Brinkerhoff, Katherine Cunningham & Shirui Li, Climate Risk Management:\nStrategies for Building Resilience to Climate Change in the Private Sector (2020), available at\nhttps://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/154987/370%20Climate%20Risk%20Managemen\nt_%20Zurich.pdf (documenting various divestment and planning strategies in managing climate-related risk\namong companies in the insurance and financial services industries).\n2895 For instance a registrant will not be required to disclose, as applicable, how it: (1) determines the relative\nsignificance of climate-related risks compared to other risks; (2) considers existing or likely regulatory\nrequirements or policies, such as GHG emissions limits, when identifying climate-related risks; (3)\nconsiders shifts in customer or counterparty preferences, technological changes, or changes in market\nprices in assessing potential transition risks; or (4) determines the materiality of climate-related risks.\n702\n\nchoose to include the details set forth in the proposed rules if they are relevant to their risk\nmanagement practices.\nUnder the approach taken in the final rules, investors will benefit from a discussion\ntailored to the registrant\u2019s facts and circumstances. For example, registrants will be able to\nexclude information that they deem to be less relevant or useful to understanding the registrant\u2019s\napproach to managing material climate-related risks. However, this flexibility could potentially\nresult in disclosures that are not fully comparable across registrants, which could reduce the\nbenefits of this provision. The more flexible approach we are adopting could also reduce the risk\nthat a registrant would have to disclose confidential information, a concern raised by some\ncommenters.2896\nThe benefits of the final rules will be lessened to the extent that this existing voluntary\nreporting overlaps in content with the required disclosures.2897 However, even in these cases,\ninvestors will benefit from having this information set forth in a Commission filing, which will\nimprove its reliability of this information and reduce search costs for investors. We also expect\nthe final rules to address concerns expressed by commenters that existing voluntary disclosures\nare often deficient in terms of understandability, transparency, and detail.2898 Therefore, we\nexpect the final rules will result in more consistent, comparable, and reliable information about\nregistrants\u2019 risk management processes as compared to the baseline.\n2896 See, e.g., letters from Cemex; Chief Execs. (noting that registrants may simply start making generic\ndisclosures); AFPA; American AALA et al.; IADC; and Sullivan Cromwell.\n2897 See supra section IV.A., particularly IV.A.5., for a discussion of existing trends in voluntary disclosure.\n2898 See letters from Bloomberg; and PRI.\n703\n\nh. Financial Statement Disclosures\ni. Expenditure Disclosures\nThe final rules require an issuer to disclose the following categories of expenditures: (1)\nexpenditures expensed as incurred and losses resulting from severe weather events and other\nnatural conditions; (2) , capitalized costs and charges resulting from severe weather events and\nother natural conditions; and (3) if carbon offsets or RECs or certificates have been used as a\nmaterial component of a registrant\u2019s plans to achieve its disclosed climate-related targets or\ngoals, the aggregate amount of carbon offsets and RECs expensed, the aggregate amount of\ncapitalized carbon offsets and RECs recognized, and the aggregate amount of losses incurred on\nthe capitalized carbon offsets and RECs.2899 Under the final rules, a capitalized cost, expenditure\nexpensed, charge, loss, or recovery results from a severe weather event or other natural condition\nwhen the event or condition is a \u201csignificant contributing factor\u201d in incurring the capitalized\ncosts, expenditure expensed, charge, loss, or recovery.2900\nThe final rules require financial statement disclosures only if the capitalized costs,\nexpenditures expensed, charges, and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and\nother natural conditions exceed certain thresholds.2901 Specifically, a registrant will be required\nto disclose capitalized costs and charges incurred as a result of severe weather events or other\nnatural conditions if the aggregate amount of the absolute value of capitalized costs and charges\nincurred is one percent or more of the absolute value of shareholders\u2019 equity or deficit, but no\ndisclosure will be required if such amount is less than $500,000 for the relevant fiscal year.2902\n2899 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(b), (c), (d) and (e).\n2900 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(g).\n2901 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(b).\n2902 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(b)(2).\n704\n\nSimilarly, a registrant will be required to disclose expenditures expensed and losses incurred as a\nresult of severe weather events and other natural conditions if the aggregate amount of such\nexpenditures expensed and losses is one percent or more of the absolute value of income or loss\nbefore income tax expense (\u201cpretax income\u201d), but no disclosure will be required if such amount\nis less than $100,000 for the relevant fiscal year.2903 If the disclosure threshold is triggered,\nregistrants will be required to disclose the aggregate amount of the capitalized costs,\nexpenditures expensed, charges, and losses and identify where the amounts are presented in the\nincome statement and the balance sheet.\nWe expect that disclosure of capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses\nincurred resulting from severe weather events and other natural conditions will enable investors\nto better assess the effects of these events and conditions (i.e., types of physical risks) on a\nregistrant\u2019s financial position and financial performance. Better disclosures of physical risks can\nprovide decision-useful information to investors.2904 For example, one study found that a one\nstandard deviation increase in exposure to heat stress is associated with a 40 basis point increase\nin yields on corporate bonds.2905 Another study found that stock price reactions to climate-\nrelated risk disclosures in earnings calls are more negative for companies that have experienced a\nsevere weather event in the quarter.2906\n2903 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(b)(1).\n2904 H. Hong, et al., supra note 2739.\n2905 Viral V. Acharya, Timothy Johnson, Suresh Sundaresan & Tuomas Tomunen, Is Physical Climate Risk\nPriced? Evidence From Regional Variation in Exposure to Heat Stress, Nat\u2019l Bureau of Econ. Rsch., No.\nw304452022 (2022).\n2906 Brian Bratten & Sung-Yuan (Mark) Cheng, The Information Content of Managers\u2019 Climate Risk\nDisclosure (Sept. 2023), available at https://ssrn.com/abstract=4068992 (retrieved from SSRN Elsevier\ndatabase).\n705\n\nWe anticipate that these financial statement disclosures will result in increased\nconsistency and comparability relative to registrants\u2019 current disclosure practices. In particular,\nour decision to use a bright-line threshold will ensure that investors have access to decision-\nuseful information for all registrants that have been meaningfully impacted by severe weather-\nrelated events and other natural conditions. Comparisons across registrants may enable investors\nto assess how different registrants manage and respond to severe weather events and other\nnatural conditions, while comparisons over time will enable investors to evaluate how registrants\nare adapting to these types of events and conditions.\nA better understanding of registrants\u2019 exposure to severe weather events and other natural\nconditions will help individual investors manage their portfolio-level exposure to climate-related\nphysical risks. Whereas some climate-related risks may be company-specific, others may be\ncorrelated across different registrants and across time.2907 The financial statement disclosures\nrequired by the final rules will provide investors with information to help assess which types of\nclimate-related physical risks are company-specific, and therefore diversifiable, and which are\nnot. This will better equip investors to limit their portfolio-level exposure to non-diversifiable\nclimate-related physical risks by selecting companies less sensitive to any non-diversifiable risks\nrelated to severe weather events and other natural conditions.\nThe value of this financial statement information to assessing risk exposure depends in\npart on the extent to which past exposure to severe weather events or other natural conditions\n2907 See Acharya, et al., supra note 2905 (finding \u201cevidence that other dimensions of physical climate risk\u2014\nestimated damages due to droughts, floods, hurricanes and sea level rise\u2014have systematic asset pricing\neffects in these three asset classes. This is consistent with these risks being smaller economically and more\nidiosyncratic (i.e., diversifiable and/or insurable) compared to heat stress.\u201d).\n706\n\npredicts future exposure to those events or conditions.2908 For example, commenters questioned\nthe benefits of disclosures related to physical risks given their view that there is inherent\nuncertainty of trends in exposure.2909 However, other commenters indicated that a better\nunderstanding of the impact of past severe weather events would help them assess a registrant\u2019s\nexposure to physical risks going forward, and some commenters highlighted the value of having\nquantitative estimates of impacts.2910 We agree that discussion of past impacts could be\ninformative. The required expenditure disclosures will help investors identify the relative\nmagnitude of different risk trends in various types of risk over time. Moreover, historical data\nmay help investors assess a company\u2019s response to severe weather events or other natural\nconditions. This will help investors assess a registrant's risk management and risk mitigation.\nThis information will allow investors to better tailor their decisions to their own risk-tolerance.\nIn the context of the proposal, commenters expressed concern that these benefits will be\nlessened if reporting companies choose to apply the final rules in different ways.2911 For\nexample, investors may mistakenly conclude that a registrant has a very high level of exposure to\nclimate-related physical risks simply because the registrant takes a very inclusive approach to\nidentifying \u201csevere weather events or other natural conditions.\u201d Different interpretations of\n2908 See, e.g., Harrison Hong, Neng Wang & Jinqiang Yang, Mitigating Disaster Risks in the Age of Climate\nChange, Nat\u2019l Bur. of Econ. Rsch. Working Paper No. w27066 (2020) (concluding that past exposure\npredicts future exposure); letter from AEI (expressing the opposite view); see also, Michael Barnett et al.,\nPricing Uncertainty Induced by Climate Change, 33 Rev. of Fin. Stud. 1024 (2020).\n2909 See, e.g., letter from AEI.\n2910 See, e.g., letters from RMI (\u201cEspecially for physical risks, losses incurred may be indicative of chronic risk\nexposure (e.g., assets in areas that are drought-prone or exposed to sea level rise), or they may stem from\nacute climate impacts . . . it will be important for investors to have the information necessary to assess\nforward-looking risk exposures.\u201d); Amer. Academy Actuaries (\u201cIdentification of material risks without\nsufficient quantitative disclosure of financial impact would not benefit investors, so investors want to\nunderstand the relative magnitude of various climate risks, track the size of various climate risks over time,\nand compare the climate risk of different registrants.\u201d).\n2911 See, e.g., letter from ACLI.\n707\n\nwhich \u201ccapitalized costs,\u201d \u201cexpenditures expensed,\u201d \u201ccharges,\u201d or \u201closses\u201d are required to be\ndisclosed by the final rules could similarly reduce the comparability benefits.2912 The final rules\naddress this concern by narrowing the scope of the disclosures (as discussed below). Any\ndifferences in application may be relatively benign or they may be used strategically to highlight\nor downplay certain aspects of the effects on the registrant\u2019s financial statements. We expect the\ninclusion of these disclosures in the financial statements to mitigate these types of concerns, as\nthe disclosures will be subject to ICFR and an audit by an independent registered public\naccounting firm. Moreover, we believe the final rules\u2019 requirement to disclose contextual\ninformation, such as a description of significant inputs and assumptions used, significant\njudgments made, and if applicable, policy decisions made by the registrant to calculate the\nspecified disclosures, alongside the expenditures disclosures should help to mitigate the concerns\ndiscussed above by providing additional transparency and facilitating comparability,2913 although\nwe note that some commenters were skeptical about the added value of contextual information in\nthis respect.2914\nSeveral commenters highlighted comparability concerns resulting from ambiguities and\nuncertainty related to the definition of transition activities and the proposal\u2019s approach to\nattribution. For example, one commenter asked whether replacing a light bulb with an LED bulb\nwould constitute a transition expense.2915 Another commenter asked how a registrant should\n2912 See, e.g., letter from Grant Thornton LLP (\u201cThe Final Rule should explain whether (a) capitalized costs\nconsist only of costs associated with purchases of property, plant, and equipment, or (b) the definition is\nbroader, including any costs initially recognized as a debit on the registrant\u2019s balance sheet, such as prepaid\nexpenses.\u201d).\n2913 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(a).\n2914 See, e.g., letter from ABA, Securities Law Comm.\n2915 See letter from Amazon.\n708\n\nidentify the portion of a cost that could be attributable to drought.2916 These hypotheticals, and\nmany others raised by commenters, are addressed by limiting the financial statement disclosures\nto the capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses incurred as a result of severe\nweather events and other natural conditions and the capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, and\nlosses related to carbon offsets and RECs (instead of requiring the disclosure of expenditures\nrelated to transition activities generally in the financial statements)2917 and by the revised\napproach to attribution. However, we recognize that some issuers will apply the final rules\ndifferently than others. For example, several commenters pointed out that some registrants\nmight consider a hurricane to be a severe weather event regardless of whether hurricanes are\ncommon to the area while others might base this assessment on whether a weather event is\nuncharacteristic or more severe than usual.2918 Although a more prescriptive requirement could\nincrease comparability, it may do so at the expense of disclosure that is more decision-useful for\ninvestors for the reasons stated above.2919 We also expectcomparability of the disclosures to\nimprove over time as registrants gain more experience applying the disclosure thresholds and\nattribution standards and consensus emerges among registrants regarding best practices for\ncompliance with the final rules.\nIn addition to reducing information asymmetry about the impact of severe weather events\nand other natural conditions, these disclosures will improve consistency and comparability\n2916 See letter from ABA, Securities Law Comm.\n2917 Although we are requiring disclosure of material expenditures incurred and material impacts on financial\nestimates and assumptions that (i) \u201cin management\u2019s assessment, directly result from activities to mitigate\nor adapt to climate-related risks, including adoption of new technologies or processes\u201d (See 17 CFR\n229.1502(d)(2)); or (ii) \u201coccur as a direct result of the target or goal or the actions taken to make progress\ntoward meeting the target or goal.\u201d (See 17 CFR 229.1504(c)(2)).\n2918 See, e.g., letter from PwC.\n2919 See id.\n709\n\nrelative to registrants\u2019 current disclosure practices. We are unable to quantify these benefits, and\nwe are cognizant that registrants will exercise discretion in making their disclosures.\nNevertheless, we expect comparability of the disclosures to improve over time as consensus\nemerges among registrants on best practices for compliance with the final rules.\nThe benefits of the disclosures will also be reduced if the final rules result in disclosures\nthat are not decision-useful to investors, for example if they represent a small portion of\ncapitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and/or losses. We believe that the final rules\nmitigate this risk by not requiring disclosure if the aggregate amount of the absolute value of the\neffects of severe weather events or other natural conditions is less than one percent of pretax\nincome for income statement effects or of shareholders\u2019 equity for balance sheet effects.2920\nHowever, we recognize the possibility that these thresholds may nonetheless result in some\ndisclosure of information that is not decision-useful for investors, depending upon the facts and\ncircumstances of the particular company, especially for companies with limited pretax income or\nshareholders\u2019 equity. Some commenters took issue with the use of absolute values for\ndetermining whether the disclosure threshold is triggered, explaining that if the net effect of an\nevent is not material, it is not clear why the positive and negative components would be\nmaterial.2921 Others had a contrary view and thought it was important to delineate the positive\nand negative effects to help protect against greenwashing.2922 Many commenters viewed a one\npercent threshold in the context of the financial statement disclosure to be too low.2923 The de\n2920 The choice of a 1% threshold is consistent with what the Commission currently uses in other contexts for\ndisclosure of certain items within the financial statements (e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 210.5-03.1(a) and 210.12-13).\n2921 See, e.g., letter from Cemex.\n2922 See, e.g., letter from ClientEarth.\n2923 See, e.g., letter from Moody\u2019s.\n710\n\nminimis thresholds partially address this concern. For example, we estimate that in 2022, the de\nminimis value of $100,000 exceeded one percent of the absolute value of pretax income for\napproximately 17 percent of companies and the de minimis value of $500,000 exceeded one\npercent of the absolute value of shareholders\u2019 equity for approximately 24 percent of\ncompanies.2924 Conversely, it is also possible that some disclosures that would have been\ndecision-useful to investors may not meet the disclosure thresholds and therefore will not be\nrequired to be included in the note to the financial statements under the final rules.\nThe disclosure thresholds may also result in partial disclosures of the financial effects of\nsevere weather events and other natural conditions. For example, if a registrant exceeds the\nincome statement threshold, but not the balance sheet threshold, it is only required to disclose\nexpenditures expensed as incurred and losses on the income statement and it need not disclose\nthe effects on the balance sheet, if any. Some registrants may find it simplest to disclose how the\nsevere weather event or natural condition affected both the income statement and balance sheet\nwhile others might limit their disclosure to the rules\u2019 requirements. If so, the disclosures could\nlead to confusion about, for example, how and whether the severe weather event affected the\nfinancial statements for which disclosure is not required. We acknowledge that in some\ncircumstances this may result in investors only receiving a partial picture of the financial\nstatement effects of a particular event or condition; however, we think that applying the\ndisclosure threshold separately to the income statement and the balance sheet will be more\nstraightforward for registrants to implement and therefore will help to limit the overall burden of\nthe final rules. To the extent this is a concern for an issuer, there is nothing in the final rules that\nwould prevent a registrant from disclosing how the severe weather event or other natural\n2924 Estimates are based on 2022 registrants (supra note 2578) and data from Compustat.\n711\n\ncondition affected both the income statement and balance sheet, even if the disclosure threshold\nfor one of the financial statements is not triggered.\nSome commenters raised the possibility that the financial statement disclosures could\nconfuse or distract investors from other factors that contribute meaningfully to the financial\nstatements.2925 We believe our decision to limit the scope of disclosure to expenditures resulting\nfrom severe weather events and other natural conditions should mitigate these concerns.2926\nFurthermore, the fact that the information is tagged in Inline XBRL will facilitate an investor\u2019s\nability to extract and sort the information that the investor deems more useful.2927\nMany commenters raised concerns about registrants\u2019 ability to isolate or attribute\nparticular costs or expenses to severe weather events and other natural conditions or to transition\nactivities, explaining it would be complicated and costly.2928 We believe that this cost is largely\nmitigated by the attribution principle included in the final rules, which requires registrants to\ndisclose the entire capitalized cost, expenditure expensed, charge, or loss, provided that a severe\nweather event or other natural condition was a \u201csignificant contributing factor\u201d to incurring the\nexpense.\nThe requirement in the final rules to disclose where in the income statement or the\nbalance sheet the disclosed expenditures expensed, capitalized costs, charges, and losses are\n2925 See, e.g., letter from API stating (\u201cThe flood of information and the presumed importance that would attach\nto it by virtue of the SEC\u2019s mandate could easily distract investors from equally important or more topically\nrelevant material information that a registrant discloses.\u201d).\n2926 The final rules are not the only place where disaggregated disclosure is required. We note that U.S. GAAP\nand IFRS require the disaggregation of certain information on the face of the financial statements or in the\nnotes to the financial statements. For example, FASB ASC Topic 220 Income Statement \u2013 Reporting\nComprehensive Income requires the nature and financial effects of each event or transaction that is unusual\nin nature or occurs infrequently to be presented separately in the income statement or in the notes to the\nfinancial statements. See ASC 220-20-50-1.\n2927 See infra section IV.C.2.ix.\n2928 See, e.g., letter from BOA.\n712\n\npresented could result in some incremental compliance costs. However, the expenditures\nexpensed, capitalized costs, charges, and losses subject to disclosure are all captured in the books\nand records of the registrant and are measured and recognized in accordance with GAAP, such\nthat concerns commenters raised about needing to develop and test new systems to track line-\nitem impacts of climate-related expenses should be substantially mitigated under the final rules,\nrelative to the proposed rules.2929\nMany commenters expressed concerns with the proposed one percent disclosure\nthresholds as discussed in detail in section II.K.2.b.ii. Some of these commenters specifically\nhighlighted that registrants would have challenges estimating or determining one percent of the\nindividual line items before period end, which would require the tracking of all financial impacts\nand expenditures throughout the reporting period.2930 In response to these commenters\u2019\nfeedback,2931 the final rules do not require the disclosure of the proposed Financial Impact\nMetrics, which would have required the disclosure of financial impacts (and the determination of\nwhether the disclosure threshold was met) on a line-by-line basis. Instead, the final rules focus\non the disclosure of discrete expenditures and require the disclosure threshold to be calculated\nonce for impacts to the income statement and once for impacts to the balance sheet using as the\ndenominator income or loss before income tax expense or benefit and shareholders\u2019 equity or\ndeficit, respectively. In addition to reducing the number of calculations that are necessary to\ndetermine whether disclosure is required as compared to the proposal, as discussed above in\nsection II.K.3.c.ii, we believe that simplifying the threshold in this manner will give registrants\n2929 See, e.g., letter from Amer. Bankers.\n2930 See, e.g., letter from ABA, Securities Law Comm.\n2931 See section II.K.c.2.\n713\n\nthe ability to estimate the amount or magnitude of these denominators earlier in the fiscal year,\nas compared to the proposed rules. As a result, the burdens on registrants associated with the\nfinal rules will be much less than they would have been under the proposed disclosure\nthresholds. That said, we recognize that registrants may need to track their expenditures\nexpensed, capitalized costs, charges, and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events\nthroughout the year to comply with the final rules.\nAny differences in application of the rules that are not fully addressed by subjecting the\ndisclosures to third-party audits could also introduce some incremental legal and compliance\ncosts. For example, registrants may face some litigation risk stemming from their classification\nof expenditures. As above, we expect some of these costs to decrease over time as registrants\ngain experience applying the final rules and best practices emerge for application of the final\nrules.\nThe final rules also require that a registrant disclose, as part of the required contextual\ninformation, recoveries resulting from severe weather events and natural conditions, if they are\nrequired to disclose capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, or losses incurred\nresulting from the same severe weather events or natural conditions. This provision will allow\ninvestors to better understand the net impact of severe weather events.\nFinally, the rules also require disclosure of expenditures expensed, capitalized costs, and\nlosses resulting from the purchase and use of carbon offsets and RECs if carbon offsets or RECs\nhave been used as a material component of a registrant\u2019s plans to achieve its disclosed climate-\nrelated targets or goals. As discussed in more detail in section IV.C.2.d, providing investors with\ndisclosure regarding expenditures resulting from a registrant\u2019s purchase and use of carbon offsets\nand RECs will allow investors to better understand the registrant\u2019s approach to meeting its\n714\n\ntargets or goals and any applicable requirements set by other regulators.2932 These disclosures\ncould introduce some incremental compliance and audit costs, but we expect these costs to be\nrelatively small as these expenditures expensed, capitalized costs, and losses are discrete and\neasily identifiable.\nii. Contextual Information, Historical Periods, and Other Requirements\nThe final rules require registrants to provide contextual information, to accompany the\nfinancial statement disclosures of expenditures expensed as incurred losses and resulting from\nsevere weather events and other natural conditions, capitalized costs and charges resulting from\nsevere weather events and other natural conditions, and, if carbon offsets or renewable energy\ncredits or certificates have been used as a material component of a registrant\u2019s plants to achieve\nits disclosed targets or goals, the aggregate among of carbon offsets and renewable energy\ncredits or certificates expensed, the aggregate amount of capitalized carbon offsets and\nrenewable energy credits or certificates recognized, and the aggregate amount of losses incurred\non the capitalized carbon offsets and renewable energy certificates or credits.2933 This\ninformation will explain the basis for the financial statement disclosures, including a description\nof any significant inputs and assumptions used, significant judgments made to calculate the\ndisclosures, and other information that is important to an investor\u2019s understanding of the\nfinancial statement effects. The rules further require that a registrant use financial information\nthat is consistent with the scope of its consolidated financial statements and apply the same\naccounting principles that it is required to apply in the preparation of its consolidated financial\nstatements.\n2932 See, e.g., letters from Amer. For Fin. Reform; and Sunrise Project et al.\n2933 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(a).\n715\n\nCollectively, the inclusion of contextual information and the presentation of financial\nstatement disclosures that are consistent with the rest of the financial statements should improve\ninvestors\u2019 ability to understand and compare registrants\u2019 financial statement effects. Several\ncommenters agreed with this rationale for providing contextual information.2934\nIt is possible that some disclosures of contextual information may be of limited\nusefulness to investors in understanding the financial statement effects. Likewise, some\nregistrants may provide disclosures with a level of detail that investors deem immaterial.\nUltimately, the level of detail important to understand a particular registrant\u2019s disclosure of the\nfinancial statement effects and thus necessary for compliance with the final rules will depend on\nthe specific facts and circumstances faced by that registrant. We therefore believe that the\nflexibility provided in the final rules achieves the benefits of eliciting disclosures that are both\ncomparable and most likely to be relevant to investors\u2019 understanding of the registrant\u2019s financial\nstatement disclosures, without imposing significant additional costs on registrants and the\ninvestors who use the disclosures. This conclusion is supported by commenters\u2019 reactions to the\nproposal, which were generally supportive of the requirement to provide contextual\ninformation.2935\nIn a change from the proposal, the final rules require the presentation of the financial\nstatement disclosures on a prospective basis only. That is, the final rules require registrants to\nprovide disclosure for the registrant\u2019s most recently completed fiscal year, and to the extent\npreviously disclosed or required to be disclosed, for the historical fiscal year(s) included in the\nconsolidated financial statements in the filing. This approach will lower the initial compliance\n2934 See, e.g., letters from Airlines for America; and IATA.\n2935 See section II.K.6.a\n716\n\ncosts of the rule, although investors will not immediately benefit from the ability to make year-\nover-year comparisons of the financial statement effects.\niii. Financial Estimates and Assumptions\nThe final rules require registrants to disclose whether the estimates and assumptions the\nregistrant used to produce the consolidated financial statements were materially impacted by\nexposures to risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, severe weather\nevents and other natural conditions, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding, drought, wildfires,\nextreme temperatures, and sea level rise, or any climate-related targets or transition plans\ndisclosed by the registrant.2936\nThese disclosures will provide investors with information as to the sensitivity of the\nfinancial information to climate-related risks, as explained by some commenters.2937 Consider,\nfor example, a registrant that recently disclosed a net-zero emissions target. Investors could\nbenefit from understanding how that target impacted the assumptions and estimates that went\ninto the preparation of the registrant\u2019s financial statements. This benefit, as well as any costs of\nthe provision, will be lessened if registrants would have disclosed the impact of these events,\nconditions, targets, or plans on their financial estimates and assumptions regardless of the\nadoption of the final rules.2938\niv. Inclusion of Climate-Related Disclosures in the Financial Statements\nThe required disclosures must be included in a note to the financial statements and thus\naudited by an independent registered public accounting firm in accordance with existing\n2936 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(b)(h).\n2937 See, e.g., letter from IAA.\n2938 See, e.g., letter from TotalEnergies.\n717\n\nCommission rules and PCAOB auditing standards.2939 Subjecting these financial statement\ndisclosures to reasonable assurance pursuant to an audit will subject these disclosures to the same\nfinancial statement audit and ICFR as similar financial disclosures, which will alleviate possible\nconcerns about the consistency, quality, and reliability of the financial statement disclosures and\nthereby provide an important benefit to investors.2940 Assurance can increase the relevance and\nreliability of disclosures.2941 In addition, by including the required disclosures in the financial\nstatements, they will be subject to a registrant\u2019s ICFR and the requirement for management to\nestablish and maintain an adequate control structure and provide an annual assessment of the\neffectiveness of ICFR.2942 Furthermore, for AFs and LAFs, the registrant\u2019s independent auditor\nmust attest to, and report on, management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of the registrant\u2019s\nICFR.2943 Effective ICFR can reduce the risk of material misstatements to the financial\nstatements and thereby enhance the reliability and improve investor confidence in the disclosure.\nInclusion of these disclosures in the financial statements will increase the compliance\ncosts of the final rules as audit firms will need to apply sufficient appropriate audit procedures to\nthe application of the rules to each registrant\u2019s circumstances. However, we believe these\nincreased costs will be limited because the final rules will require disclosure of capitalized costs,\nexpenditures expensed, charges, and losses that are already required to be recorded in a\n2939 See 17 CFR 210.14-01(a).\n2940 See section II.K.1.\n2941 See DeFond et al., supra note 2880; V.K.

The incremental compliance costs will be due to the\nrequirement to separately disaggregate and disclose these costs, expenditures, charges, and losses\nin the notes to the financial statements.2944 Over time, we expect audits of these disclosures will\nbecome more streamlined and therefore the costs associated with these disclosures should also\ndecrease. We discuss these costs in detail in section IV.C.3.\ni. Structured Data Requirement\nUnder the final rules, the new climate-related disclosures will be required to be tagged in\nthe Inline XBRL structured data language on a phased in basis.2945 The provision requiring\nInline XBRL tagging of climate-related disclosures will benefit investors by making those\ndisclosures more readily available for aggregation, comparison, filtering, and other enhanced\nanalytical methods.2946 These benefits are expected to reduce search costs and substantially\nimprove investors\u2019 information-processing efficiency.2947 Structured data requirements for\npublic company financial statement disclosures have been observed to reduce information-\nprocessing costs, thereby decreasing information asymmetry and increasing transparency by\n2944 The incremental costs include the disclosure of financial statement estimates and assumptions materially\nimpacted by severe weather events and other conditions or disclosed targets or transition plans; however,\nwe believe these incremental costs will be minimal.\n2945 See 17 CFR 229.1508; 17 CFR 232.405. LAFs must begin complying with the disclosure requirements in\nfilings covering fiscal year 2025 and must comply with the tagging requirements in filings covering fiscal\nyear 2026. Other categories of filers must comply with the tagging requirements upon their initial\ncompliance with the climate disclosure rules. For example, AFs must comply with tagging requirements\nwhen they first provide climate disclosures in filings covering fiscal year 2026.

However, we do\nnot believe the final rules will result in an excessive use of custom tags, because filers will be\n2957 See letter from Climate Advisers.\n2958 See letter from CFA.\n2959 See letter from IATP.\n2960 See letter from AFPM.\n2961 See, e.g., Joung W.

Also, as\ndiscussed above, the one-year transition period for tagging requirements will enable the climate\ntaxonomy development process to leverage samples of climate disclosures in Commission filings\nto further build out the list of standard tags and adapt to common disclosure practices. This\nshould further reduce the likelihood of excessive custom tags and thus improve data quality.2964\nSuch improvement in data quality will come at the cost of data users having one less year of\ntagged climate disclosures, making the climate disclosures filed during that year more difficult to\nanalyze efficiently.\n3. Quantifiable Direct Costs on Registrants\nIn this section, we attempt to quantify the direct costs of compliance for registrants that\nwill be impacted by the final rules.2965 These costs could be incurred internally (e.g., through\nemployee hours or hiring additional staff) or externally (e.g., via third-party service providers,\nsuch as auditors or consultants).\nOur estimates are informed, in part, by feedback we received from public comment\nletters. As discussed below, however, commenters offered a wide range of cost estimates,\nsuggesting that there is significant heterogeneity when it comes to expected compliance costs\n2963 See 17 CFR 232.405(c)(1)(iii)(B).

This variability\nadds to the challenges in estimating compliance costs. Additionally, many commenters provided\naggregate cost estimates that did not include certain elements required by the final rules, or\nincluded other elements that are not required in the final rules,2966 without providing a\nbreakdown of the component costs. Without a breakdown of component costs, it is difficult to\nuse these cost estimates to quantify the direct cost of the final rules. Furthermore, changes from\nthe proposal, often in response to commenter concerns about costs, will result in corresponding\ndifferences in the anticipated cost of the final rules as compared to the proposal.2967\nNonetheless, we have endeavored below to factor these comments into our analysis to determine\nregistrants\u2019 approximate cost of compliance with the final rules.\na. Comments and data on direct cost estimates of the proposed rules\nIn the Proposing Release, the Commission requested comment on all aspects of its\neconomic analysis, including the potential costs and benefits of the proposed rules and\nalternatives, and whether the proposed rules, if adopted, will promote efficiency, competition,\nand capital formation or have an impact on investor protection.2968 The Commission specifically\n2966 Commenters\u2019 estimates that include the cost of voluntarily undertaking a specific activity (e.g., the costs of\nsetting targets or goals, formulating transition plans, or conducting scenario analysis) may not be indicative\nof the compliance costs of the final rules since the final rules do not necessarily require the undertaking of\nsuch activities, but rather require only the attendant disclosures in certain cases.\n2967 For example, as compared to the proposed rules, the final rules include a number of changes intended to\nreduce the burden of the Regulation S-X disclosure requirements and do not require Scope 3 emissions\nreporting.\n2968 See Proposing Release, section IV.G.\n725\n\nrequested empirical data, estimation methodologies, and other factual support for commenters\u2019\nviews, in particular, on costs and benefits estimates.2969\nWe received many comments asserting that the direct costs imposed by the proposed\nrules would be much greater than the Commission estimated.2970 Many letters from individual\ncompanies and industry groups provided quantitative estimates of the cost to comply with the\nproposed rules that were considerably higher than the estimates included in the Proposing\nRelease.2971 One commenter conducted a survey of 263 public companies between April and\nJune 2022.2972 Seventy-nine percent of non-SRC respondents in this survey asserted that the\nCommission under-estimated the costs of compliance with the proposed rules. Seventy-three\npercent of survey participants responded that their compliance costs under the proposed rules\nwould exceed the Commission\u2019s estimates in the Proposing Release, with 41 percent of\nrespondents stating that the compliance costs would exceed $1 million on an ongoing basis.2973\nAnother commenter, a biotechnology trade association, surveyed its members and found that 56\npercent of respondents expected that the proposed rules would be more expensive than the\nCommission\u2019s estimates, with 40 percent indicating it would cost between $0.5 and $1.0\nmillion.2974 Additionally, a survey of corporate executives indicated that 61 percent of\n2969 See id.\n2970 See, e.g., letters from Soc.

Twelve percent of the participants in the survey were SRCs.\n2974 See letter from Biotechnology Innovation Organization.\n726\n\nrespondents expect that the proposed rules would impose $750,000 or more in first year\ncompliance costs.2975 Some commenters specifically identified the GHG emissions reporting\nand Regulation S-X provisions of the proposed rules as likely to impose large cost burdens on\nboth registrants and potentially on non-registrants.2976\nTo help assess the direct costs of the final rules, we conducted a detailed review of\ncompliance cost estimates from commenters and other public sources. The nature of the cost\ninformation ranged from survey results, estimates directly from identifiable companies, estimates\nof anonymous companies, and general estimates, either based on industry experience, fees for\nrelated services, or derived as part of similar rulemaking processes in other jurisdictions. We\ndescribe below the cost estimates provided in these letters and other sources.\nOne commenter provided cost information from seven large-cap companies in various\nindustries on their current voluntary climate-reporting practices, which vary in their degrees of\nalignment with the proposed or final rules.2977 The responses varied considerably regarding the\nreporting activities, disclosure elements, and costs. The number of staff required to produce the\nvoluntary disclosures ranged from two to 20 full-time equivalents (\u201cFTEs\u201d). Reported employee\nhours for climate reporting (including TCFD reporting) ranged from 7,500 to 10,000 hours\n2975 PwC, Change in the Climate: How US business leaders are preparing for the SEC\u2019s climate disclosure rule\n(2023), available at https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/esg/library/sec-climate-disclosure-survey.html\n(discussing survey, conducted between Dec. 2022 and Jan. 2023, that solicits the views of 300 executives at\nU.S.-based public companies with at least $500 million in annual revenue with respect to the proposed\nrules).\n2976 See, e.g., letter from Chamber. Concerns about burdens for non-registrants were mostly focused on the\nproposed rules\u2019 Scope 3 GHG emissions disclosure requirements.

One company reported spending 9 months to prepare its TCFD report and 4 months\nresponding to the CDP questionnaire. Commonly cited external advisory services include\nenvironmental engineering consultants; emissions, climate science, and modeling consultants;\noutside counsel; and sustainability or sustainability reporting consultants, with costs ranging\nfrom $50,000 to $1.35 million annually. Third-party assurance costs ranged from $10,000 to\n$600,000. One company reported that it incurred initial costs of approximately $1.3 million to\nestablish a baseline for SASB and TCFD reporting, while another company estimated that new\nor enhanced systems, controls, audit, and other costs associated with any additional disclosure\nrequirements would be over $1 million.\nThe same commenter submitted another letter presenting detailed annual cost estimates\nfrom 13 companies (11 large-cap, 1 mid-cap, and 1 small-cap).2978 Similar to their first\ncomment, the responses displayed considerable variation with respect to current disclosure\nscope, granularity, and reported costs. Specific estimates of initial costs to comply with the\nproposed rules included $5 to $10 million,2979 $6 million (with $4 to $5 million in ongoing\ncosts),2980 $10 million (with \u201cmuch of it recurring\u201d),2981 and $650,000 to $1.5 million (with\n$650,000 in ongoing costs).2982 In many cases, the reported costs in this comment letter\naggregated several different disclosure items and related activities without providing a cost\n2978 See letter from Soc. Corp. Gov (June 17, 2022). The commenter acknowledges that these companies are\n\u201cnot the norm.

For example, some companies\nreported their costs of measuring emissions. One small-cap company estimated $300,000\nannually in internal staff time for its Scope 1 emissions data collection and reporting. This letter\nalso included the aggregate ongoing costs of measuring Scope 1, Scope 2, and some Scope 3\nemissions2983 from three different companies. These companies\u2019 respective estimates are\n$200,000,2984 $75,000,2985 and 188 internal hours.2986 Other specific cost estimates included\nassurance (ranging from $10,000 to $550,000, depending on the scope and level of assurance),\nexternal consultants (ranging from $55,000 to $990,000), and other activities related to\nsustainability reporting.\nA public report presents detailed climate-related reporting cost estimates from three\nanonymous companies.2987 One company, a large-cap financial institution, reported that the cost\nof issuing their first TCFD report was less than $100,000 and that annual ongoing costs for\nresponding to the CDP questionnaire is likewise less than $100,000. Another company, a mid-\ncap waste management company, stated that the cost of producing their first TCFD and SASB\nreport were both less than $10,000. This company reported that its total annual employee costs\nassociated with climate disclosure are approximately $12,600.

The remaining company, a large-cap industrial\nmanufacturing company, reported that the combined cost of producing its first TCFD, SASB,\nand GRI disclosures amounted to between $250,000 and $350,000 (without providing a\nbreakdown of component costs), while the cost of responding to its first CDP questionnaire was\nless than $50,000. This company reported that it also spent $400,000 annually for third-party\nauditors and consultants that provide support in the company\u2019s climate disclosure efforts.\nAnother commenter provided the results of a survey, conducted from February to March\n2022, of corporate issuers and institutional investors ( \u201cERM survey\u201d).2988 The results reflect the\nresponses of 39 issuers, of which 29 were LAFs.2989 The ERM survey presents issuers\u2019 average\nannual costs in seven categories: GHG analysis and/or disclosures ($237,000);2990 climate\nscenario analysis and/or disclosures ($154,000);2991 additional climate-related analysis and/or\n2988 See ERM survey, supra note 2670. The 39 issuers included the following industries: healthcare and\npharmaceuticals; financials, insurance, and professional services; consumer discretionary products;\ncommunication services; transportation, construction, and industrials; consumer staples; oil, gas, and\nenergy; utilities; real estate; metals, plastics, and other raw material; and information technology.\n2989 See id. Respondent market capitalizations ranged from less than $300 million to more than $200 billion,\nwith the highest proportion of respondents (34%) having a market capitalization between $10 billion and\n$50 billion.\n2990 This survey category includes all costs relating to the development of GHG inventories with analysis and\ndisclosure of Scope 1, Scope 2, and/or Scope 3 emissions.\n2991 This survey category includes all costs to issuers related to conducting assessments of the impact of climate\nrisks in the short-, medium-, or long-term using scenario analysis as well as TCFD/CDP disclosure of risks\nand opportunities. Respondents were asked to exclude from this category any costs that they included in\ntheir costs of GHG emissions analysis and disclosures.\n730\n\ndisclosures ($130,000);2992 internal climate risk management controls ($148,000);2993 proxy\nresponses to climate related proposals ($80,000); assurance/audits related to climate ($82,000);\nand other climate-related disclosure costs not covered by the previous six categories ($76,000).\nWe also reviewed annual cost estimates associated with existing climate-related\ndisclosure policies in the U.K. In 2021, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d) adopted\na comply-or-explain disclosure rule (\u201cFCA rule\u201d), which originally applied only to commercial\ncompanies with a U.K. premium listing2994 but, effective 2022, was subsequently expanded to\ninclude issuers of standard listed shares.2995 The U.K. Department for Business, Energy, and\nIndustrial Strategy (\u201cBEIS\u201d) adopted a similar\u2014albeit mandatory\u2014disclosure rule (\u201cBEIS\n2992 This survey category includes additional voluntary climate-related analyses and disclosures for processes\nlargely disconnected from current and proposed climate-related disclosures such as outreach, engagement,\nand management.\n2993 This survey category includes costs for internal climate risk management controls, namely the costs related\nto integrating climate risk into enterprise risk management, oversight at the board level, strategic planning,\ninternal audit, and other fundamental business processes. In addition, this category includes issuer costs\nrelated to climate-related data collection and aggregation, including IT costs and staff time; internal review\nof climate-related data collection by management, board committees, and the board; in-house counsel\ndrafting; and review by outside counsel.\n2994 See FCA, Policy Statement PS20/17, Proposals to Enhance Climate-related Disclosures by Listed Issuers\nand Clarification of Existing Disclosure Obligations (Dec. 2020), available at\nhttps://www.fca.org.uk/publication/policy/ps20-17.pdf. This document states that the rule would apply to\n480 companies that have a premium listing. A premium listed company is a company listed on the London\nStock Exchange that is subject to more stringent compliance and disclosure requirements in addition to the\nminimum standards outlined in the UK provisions that implemented the EU Consolidated Admissions and\nReporting Directive (CARD) and the EU Transparency Directive.\n2995 See FCA, Consultation Paper CP21/18, Enhancing Climate-related Disclosures by Standard Listed\nCompanies and Seeking Views on ESG Topics in Capital Markets (June 2021), available at\nhttps://www.fca.org.uk/publication/consultation/cp21-18.pdf. Cost estimates of the FCA rule are sourced\nfrom this document. See also FCA, Policy Statement PS21/23, Enhancing Climate-related Disclosures by\nStandard Listed Companies (Dec. 2021). This rule applies to 244 issuers: 148 issuers of standard listed\nequity shares as well as 96 additional issuers (i.e., standard listed issuers of Global Depository Receipts and\nstandard listed issuers of shares other than equity shares, excluding standard listed investment entities and\nshell companies). A standard listed company is a company listed on the London Stock Exchange that is\nsubject to the minimum standards outlined in the UK provisions that implemented the EU Consolidated\nAdmissions and Reporting Directive (CARD) and the EU Transparency Directive.\n731\n\nrule\u201d), also effective 2022,2996 that was previously used to inform the Commission\u2019s cost\nestimates of the proposed rules.2997 The BEIS rule generally applies to companies that have over\n500 employees and/or a turnover of more than \u00a3500 million.2998 Both rules exhibit significant\noverlap as they are both largely based on the TCFD framework\u2019s major components, including\ndisclosure on governance, strategy, and risk management, all of which have similar counterparts\nin the final rules. Both UK rules also include scenario analysis and metrics and targets; however,\nbecause undertaking these activities is not required under the final rules (only their disclosure in\nspecific circumstances), we focus on the cost estimates of the other components that are more\nrelevant to the final rules.2999\nOne-time implementation costs\u2014which consist of \u201cfamiliarization costs\u201d and \u201clegal\nreview\u201d\u2014are estimated to be $19,5433000 by the BEIS and $15,147 by the FCA. The BEIS rule\n2996 U.K. Final Stage Impact Assessment, Mandating Climate-related Financial Disclosures By Publicly\nQuoted Companies, Large Private Companies and Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs) (2021), available\nat\nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1055931/\ntcfd-final-stage-ia.pdf (\u201cBEIS Final Stage Impact Assessment\u201d). Cost estimates of the BEIS rule (with the\nexception of familiarization costs) are sourced from this document.\n2997 See Proposing Release, section IV.C.2.a, which also reviews the BEIS rule (referred to as the \u201cUK Impact\nAssessment\u201d in the Proposing Release). The estimated costs of the BEIS rule, as outlined in the following\nparagraphs, are the same as those presented in the proposed rules, with the exception of applying an\nupdated exchange rate to convert the costs from GBP to USD.\n2998 Specifically, the BEIS rule applies to relevant Public Interest Entities (\u201cPIEs\u201d), including UK Premium and\nStandard listed companies with over 500 employees, UK registered companies with securities admitted to\nthe Alternative Investment Market with more than 500 employees, limited liability partnerships with over\n500 employees and a turnover of over \u00a3500 million, and UK registered companies that are not included in\nthe categories above and that have over 500 employees and a turnover of over \u00a3500 million.\n2999 The following cost estimates from the BEIS and FCA reflect internal labor costs with the assumption that\naffected entities have no pre-existing climate-related disclosure practices that fulfill the stated requirements.\nThe costs are converted from GBP to USD using the 2022 average exchange rate of $1.2369 USD/GBP.\n3000 The familiarization cost component is sourced from the BEIS Consultation Stage Impact Assessment (as\nopposed to Final Stage), which assumes that scenario analysis requirements are not part of the\nfamiliarization process, and thus may be a relatively better representation of the corresponding cost with\nrespect to the final rules. The familiarization cost is estimated to be \u00a312,600. See BEIS Final Stage Impact\nAssessment2996. The other initial cost related to legal review (\u00a33,200), as outlined in the BEIS Final Stage\nImpact Assessment, is added to obtain \u00a315,800 ($19,543). See supra note 2996.\n732\n\npresents first-year cost estimates of complying with climate-related disclosures associated with\nGovernance ($11,256),3001 Strategy ($16,080),3002 and Risk Management ($13,359),3003 for a\ncombined total of $40,694, which is assumed to remain the same in subsequent years. This\ncontrasts with the FCA\u2019s corresponding first-year costs of $183,028 and ongoing costs of\n$86,270 for larger issuers.3004 The FCA rule also estimates costs for small and medium-sized\nissuers, with corresponding costs of $137,271 in the first year and $64,702 in subsequent years.\nThese estimates from the FCA and BEIS rules help to inform our assessment of the\ncompliance costs of similar provisions of the final rules amending Regulation S-K, as our\napproach for these provisions is based, in part, on the TCFD recommendations. However, it is\nimportant to note that these estimates are intended to reflect compliance costs of the typical\ncompany within the designated sample of affected entities and are conditional upon several\nassumptions regarding the number of required staff, the rank or title of the staff, the required\nlabor hours, and local wage data. Actual costs can vary significantly depending on company\ncharacteristics, such as company size, industry, business model, the complexity of the company\u2019s\ncorporate structure, existing climate-related disclosure practices, and internal expertise, etc.\n3001 Governance costs include the ongoing cost to those in scope to implement, document and disclose\ngovernance of their climate related risks and opportunities and to coordinate across internal business\nfunctions.\n3002 Strategy costs include the ongoing reporting costs to those entities in scope of internally coordinating,\ndocumenting and disclosing climate-related risks and opportunities the company has identified, as well as\nreporting the impact of these risks on the company\u2019s business, strategy, and financial planning. This\nestimate does not include scenario analysis, which is discussed separately in a later paragraph.\n3003 Risk management costs are the ongoing annual costs to those entities in scope to disclose the company\u2019s\nmanagement of climate-related risks, including the coordination across functions internally, identification\nand assessment of risks and their integration into the company\u2019s overarching risk-management strategy.\nThis also includes the time taken to identify and analyze major risk exposures in the context of the\ncompany\u2019s business strategy.\n3004 The FCA presents aggregated costs for governance, strategy, and risk management disclosure instead of\nindividual costs for each of the aforementioned disclosure categories. The cost discrepancy relative to the\nBEIS rule is primarily driven by significantly different assumptions of internal labor requirements, such as\nthe number of employees, salaries, and required hours.\n733\n\nAnother commenter provided cost estimates reported by an anonymous company,\nreferred to as a \u201cWell-known seasoned issuer.\u201d3005 This company, which has made TCFD-\naligned disclosures public on its website (including Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions\ndisclosures) estimated that, combined with the amounts the company currently spends on\nvoluntary climate disclosure, the company would need to spend a total of approximately $35\nmillion over five years to implement climate-related reporting in order to comply with the\nproposed rules, if adopted as proposed. Within this amount, the company estimates one-time\nexpenses of $19 million and recurring expenses averaging $3.1 million per year. The primary\ncategories of expenses are audit fees, professional services, subscriptions, labor, licenses, and\ntraining. The company estimates that compliance with the provisions amending Regulation S-X,\nas proposed, would have initial costs of $1.5 million to $2.0 million and subsequent ongoing\ncosts of $1.0 million to $2.0 million annually. The company also estimated compliance costs for\nthe proposed Scope 3 emissions disclosure to be $15.6 million over five years, with a significant\npart of this cost attributable to attestation requirements and with \u201cfiling\u201d Scope 3 information.3006\nSeveral letters from professional trade or industry organization also provided cost\nestimates. One commenter stated that the \u201ccost of registrants trying to report in alignment with\njust certain aspects of TCFD for their first time on a voluntarily basis can be around $500,000\u2026.\nThe actual cost for complete alignment to TCFD could be up to $1,000,000 per registrant over\nseveral years,\u201d which does not include the annual cost associated with preparing for and\nconducting attestation.3007 Another commenter said that based on member feedback, the \u201ctrue\n3005 See letter from Chamber.\n3006 See letter by API. We note that the proposed rules would not have imposed any attestation requirements\nwith respect to Scope 3 emissions disclosure.\n3007 See letter from AEPC.\n734\n\ninitial set up and ongoing compliance costs for a typical retailer will be more than 35 times the\namount that the SEC has estimated....Members estimate that the initial costs of implementing the\nproposed rules would be somewhere in the $5 million to $15 million range.\u201d3008 Other\ncommenters estimated the initial cost of complying with the proposed amendments to Regulation\nS-X would exceed $100 million.3009 One commenter estimated that the combined costs of\n\u201ccomplying with the reporting requirements under S-X and S-K would cost companies $3 to $7\nmillion annually.\u201d3010\nOne commenter included cost estimates provided by members of its trade association\nwith respect to their on-going efforts, prior to the proposed rules, in measuring GHG\nemissions.3011 One member reported that an average automated GHG measuring system would\ncost $250,000 to purchase and set up, with ongoing annual costs of approximately $100,000.\nAnother member reported that \u201ccompleting questionnaires and conducting emissions\nmeasurements through an automated GHG measuring program with applicable audits costs the\ncompany about $15,000 per year to maintain.\u201d Another member company\u2019s mature Scope 1 and\n2 emissions reporting programs resulted in 100 to 200 resource hours per year.\nSeveral individual registrants also provided cost estimates of either their own current\nclimate-reporting practices or expected practices if the proposed rules were adopted as proposed.\nOne multinational registrant that engages in hydrocarbon exploration and production estimated\nthat initial compliance costs with respect to the proposed rules would range from $100 to $500\n3008 See letter from RILA.\n3009 See letters from Western Energy Alliance (suggesting initial compliance costs to be \u201cover $100 million for\nlarge companies when considering not just the new systems but the staff training required\u201d) and API\n(without specifying whether the $100 million figure reflects implementation costs or ongoing annual costs).\n3010 See letter from National Retail Federation.\n3011 See letter from IDFA.\n735\n\nmillion.3012 This registrant expressed concerns about the burden of complying with the proposed\nrules, particularly with the proposed amendments to Regulation S-X. This registrant estimated\nongoing costs to be $10 to $25 million annually. One energy company noted that it expected\ncompliance costs to be at least four to five times the estimates provided in the Proposing Release,\nprimarily due to the necessary increases in staff and the added costs in auditing and attestation\nfees.3013 Other energy companies estimated that compliance with the proposed amendments to\nRegulation S-X and reporting Scope 3 emissions would likely exceed $100 million3014 and $1\nmillion,3015 respectively.\nAnother commenter, a multinational energy company, estimated its internal burden hours\nfor Scope 3 emissions reporting to be 650 hours in the first year and 100 hours annually in\nsubsequent years.3016 A different commenter reported that it allocates one full-time consultant\nand 20 employees working part time each year from November to March as part of its process to\nmeasure Scope 1, Scope 2, and some Scope 3 emissions, collect and validate data, estimate and\nreview emissions, and obtain third-party limited assurance for GHG-related data in its\nsustainability report.3017 Another commenter that already tracks some Scope 1 emissions\nestimated that it may incur an additional cost of $10,556,800 or more to track and report Scope 1\nemissions from additional facilities as a result of the proposed rules.3018 A multinational\n3012 See letter from ConocoPhillips.\n3013 See letter from PPL Corporation.\n3014 See letter from Western Energy Alliance.\n3015 See letter from Williams, Inc.\n3016 See letter from \u00d8rsted.\n3017 See letter from Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n3018 See letter from Energy Transfer LP.

This commenter estimated this cost to be $7,000,000 in 2006 dollars, which was\nadjusted for inflation to obtain $10,556,800 in 2023 dollars.\n736\n\nfertilizer company estimated that the direct and indirect costs of compliance with the proposed\nrules would be between $35 million and $55 million, with assurance costs related to financial\nstatement metrics estimated to be $70,000 to $225,000 annually.3019\nWe also reviewed memoranda of staff meetings with external parties that further inform\nour assessment of the final rules\u2019 compliance costs.3020 One organization presented pricing\ninformation for the following relevant services provided: TCFD reporting, excluding measuring\nemissions and establishing targets ($100,000 average); assessing Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions\n($75,000 to $125,000); and target setting ($20,000 to $30,000).3021 A different organization\nindicated fees would range from $11,000 to $105,000 for services related to GHG accounting\n(Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions).3022 Another organization estimated that costs for assessing\nScopes 1 and 2 emissions would range between $25,000 and $45,000 and assessing Scopes 1, 2,\nand 3 emissions would cost between $50,000 and $125,000, depending on whether a given\ncompany already has emissions-measuring systems and processes in place.3023\n3019 See letter from Nutrien. This estimate includes costs associated with conducting scenario analysis and\nincluding the related information in public disclosures; measuring and reporting Scope 1 and 2 emissions\nby each GHG, obtaining reasonable assurance on Scope 1 and 2 emissions by each GHG; measuring and\nreporting Scope 3 emissions by each GHG for public disclosure subject to DCP; and disclosure of the\nproposed Financial Impact Metrics within the audited financial statements, among other proposed\ndisclosures. These costs include internal costs, external professional service fees, and additional systems\nand internal control processes that the commenter indicated would need to be designed and operating\neffectively for public disclosure of high-quality information.\n3020 The meeting memoranda are available at the same location as the comment letters in response to the\nProposing Release. See supra note 19. Some of these meetings occurred prior to the Proposing Release\nand thus any data included in the memoranda do not reflect specific details of the proposed rules; however,\nwe have considered these memoranda as part of this assessment as they contain relevant cost information.\n3021 See Memorandum Concerning Staff Meeting With Representatives of S&P Global (Feb. 4, 2022); see also\nProposing Release, supra note 1027.\n3022 See South Pole Memo; see also Proposing Release, note 1037. These numbers have been converted from\nEUR based on the 2022 average exchange rate of $1.0538 USD/EUR, rounded to the nearest $100.\n3023 See Memorandum Concerning Staff Meeting with Representatives of Persefoni (Nov. 30, 2021); see also\nProposing Release, at n. 1036.\n737\n\nThe cost information in the above sources indicates the variance and the scale of\ncompliance costs the proposed rules would have imposed on registrants. We note, however, that\nmany of the estimates combine the costs of multiple components without providing a breakdown\nof component costs, which makes it difficult to isolate only the components that are applicable to\nthe proposed or final rules. Furthermore, these voluntary cost estimates may reflect some\nselection bias such that they may be skewed toward a certain demographic (e.g., large-cap\ncompanies) and thus may not be representative of the broad sample of affected registrants.\nFinally, to the extent that the cost estimates are specific to the proposed rules, they do not\naccount for the changes made to the final rules. For example, the final rules\u2019 requirements with\nrespect to financial statements have been narrowed relative to the proposed rules.3024 In addition,\nthe final rules do not require the disclosure of Scope 3 emissions. Nevertheless, we use this cost\ninformation to the extent possible to inform our assessment of the expected compliance costs of\nthe final rules, as outlined in the following subsection.\nb. Direct cost estimates for the final rules\nThe final rules will impose a number of new disclosure requirements on registrants.\nThese requirements will result in additional compliance costs for registrants, and, depending on\nthe nature of the registrant\u2019s operations and its existing disclosure practices, these additional\ncompliance costs could be significant. Using comment letters and other sources, we take a\nconservative approach (i.e., erring on the side of overstating costs rather than understating them)\nto estimate approximate compliance costs for the final rules, which are discussed in subsequent\nsections and summarized immediately below.\n3024 See, e.g., supra sections II.K.2.c and II.K.3.c.\n738\n\nWith respect to the Regulation S-K amendments pertaining to governance disclosure\n(Item 1501); disclosure regarding the impacts of climate-related risks on strategy, business\nmodel, and outlook (Items 1502(a) through (e) and (g)); and risk management disclosure (Item\n1503), we estimate that compliance costs will be $327,000 in the first year of compliance and\n$183,000 annually in subsequent years.3025 For those registrants that conduct scenario analysis\nand are required to provide attendant disclosures (Item 1502(f)), we estimate the reporting costs\nwill be $12,000 in the first year and $6,000 in subsequent years.3026 Some registrants will be\nrequired to disclose Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions (Item 1505) after a specified phase in period.\nWe estimate that the compliance costs for these disclosures will be $151,000 in the first year of\ncompliance and $67,000 annually in subsequent years.3027 After an additional phase in period,\napplicable registrants will be required to obtain assurance for their emissions disclosures (Item\n1506). Limited assurance for emissions disclosures is estimated to cost $50,000 while\nreasonable assurance is estimated to cost $150,000.3028 For registrants that voluntarily establish\ntargets or goals and are required to provide attendant disclosures (Item 1504), we estimate the\nreporting costs will be $10,000 in the first year of establishing the target and $5,000 in\nsubsequent years.3029 With respect to amendments to Regulation S-X, we estimate an upper\nbound of $500,000 in the first year of compliance, while the annual cost in subsequent years is\n3025 See section IV.C.3.b.i.\n3026 See section IV.C.3.b.iv.\n3027 See section IV.C.3.b.ii.\n3028 See section IV.C.3.b.iii.\n3029 See section IV.C.3.b.iv.\n739\n\nestimated to have an upper bound of $375,000.3030 Incremental audit fees are estimated to have\nan upper bound of $23,000 for all years.3031\nWe emphasize that there could be a considerable range in actual compliance costs given\nthat not all costs listed above will apply to all registrants or during all measurement periods.\nDepending on the registrant, annual compliance costs (averaged over the first ten years of\ncompliance) could range from less than $197,000 to over $739,000.3032 A registrant\u2019s\ncompliance costs may be at the lower end of the cost range if, for example, it does not conduct\nscenario analysis, does not have material Scope 1 and 2 emissions, has no climate-related target\nor goal, and has no applicable expenditures or financial statement impacts that require disclosure,\nthereby avoiding the corresponding costs of the aforementioned disclosure items. However, this\nregistrant may have exposures to material climate risks that necessitate governance disclosure;\ndisclosure regarding climate-related risks that have material impacts on strategy, business model,\nand outlook; and risk management disclosure. In this case, the cost of these required\ndisclosures\u2014estimated to be $327,000 in the first year of compliance and $183,000 annually in\nsubsequent years3033\u2014would comprise the full compliance cost of the final rules. This\ncorresponds with an average annual compliance cost of $197,000 (rounded to the nearest $1,000)\nover the first ten years of compliance.3034 Incremental compliance costs would be even lower for\n3030 See section IV.C.3.b.v.\n3031 Id.\n3032 Registrants will incur compliance costs for different disclosure items at different times due to applicable\nphase in periods. For ease of comprehension and comparability, these estimates are presented as the\naverage annual compliance cost over the first ten years of compliance. See infra notes 3034 and 3036 for\nadditional details.\n3033 See section IV.C.3.b.i.\n3034 ($327,000 + $183,000*(9 years))/10 = $197,400.\n740\n\nregistrants that already provide these disclosures (either voluntarily or as required by other laws\nor jurisdictions).3035\nAt the upper end of the cost range, for example, there may be other registrants for which\nall estimated compliance costs apply. In this example, these registrants could incur an estimated\n$872,0003036 in the first year of compliance and lower annual costs in subsequent years. After\nthe respective phase in periods, these registrants would incur additional costs for GHG emissions\ndisclosure, limited assurance, and subsequently reasonable assurance (assuming the registrant is\nan LAF). This registrant would incur an average annual compliance cost of $739,000 (rounded\nto the nearest $1,000) over the first ten years of compliance.3037 These examples highlight the\npotential range in compliance costs depending on a given registrant\u2019s circumstances, including\n(but not limited to) industry, size, existing climate-related disclosure practices, and whether the\nregistrant\u2019s climate-risk exposure exceeds applicable materiality thresholds for disclosure.\nRegarding assessing materiality to determine whether disclosure is required under the\nfinal rules, we acknowledge that some registrants may need to expend resources to first\ndetermine whether particular disclosure items are material, even in cases where registrants\nultimately determine they do not need to make disclosure. While commenters provided\nestimates of the overall costs of measuring and assessing GHG emissions and making disclosure\n3035 See supra section IV.A for a discussion on existing laws (domestic and foreign) that elicit similar\ndisclosures and current market practices with respect to climate-related disclosures. See also infra section\nIV.C.3.c.\n3036 $327,000 (governance disclosure; disclosure regarding climate-related risks that have material impacts on\nstrategy, business model, and outlook; and risk management disclosure) + $12,000 (reporting cost of\nscenario analysis) + $10,000 (reporting cost of target or goal) + $500,000 (disclosures related to\namendments to Regulation S-X, upper bound) + $23,000 (audit fees, upper bound) = $872,000.\n3037 Total compliance costs are calculated each year for the first ten years of compliance, taking into account\nthe various disclosure items and their respective phase in periods. The average of these annual costs is\n$738,700.\n741\n\nunder TCFD disclosure frameworks, they did not provide a level of detail that would enable us to\nreliably disaggregate the materiality determination from the costs of disclosure more broadly.\nWe also note that the cost of such a determination could vary depending on the registrant\u2019s facts\nand circumstances and may in some cases be de minimis. While we have not provided a\nstandalone cost estimate of making such materiality determinations, our estimates of the costs of\ngovernance disclosure, disclosure regarding the impacts of climate-related risks on strategy,\nbusiness model, and outlook, and risk management disclosure begin with TCFD disclosure as a\nstarting point.3038 Thus, to the extent that a materiality or similar assessment is included in\nTCFD disclosure, this cost is reflected in the Commission\u2019s compliance cost estimates with\nrespect to the above disclosure items.\nMoreover, the above estimates are conditional upon several factors. First, they depend on\nthe sample of sources and commenters that voluntarily provided relevant cost information.3039\nTo the extent that this sample is not representative of the broad set of affected registrants, the\nresulting estimates may similarly be less representative. In addition to company size and\nindustry, another relevant factor may be the decision to engage third-party advisory services.\nSome registrants may determine that engaging such advisory services will better position them to\ncomply with the final rules, while others may decide to use in-house resources.3040 The above\nestimates incorporate information on both internal costs (e.g., employee hours) and external costs\n3038 See section IV.C.3.b.i.\n3039 See supra section IV.C.3.a.\n3040 For example, registrants that are required to disclose emissions may be more likely to rely on external\nservices. Registrants facing climate-related risks that are complex or a myriad may also be more likely to\nengage third party services. We emphasize that the final rules impose no requirement with respect to the\nuse of third-party services and that registrants are free to decide how best to meet compliance based on\ntheir specific circumstances.\n742\n\n(e.g., hiring third parties or consultants), as provided by comment letters and other sources.3041\nSecond, several analytical assumptions were incorporated in the estimation process. While we\nendeavored to apply them consistently and in a conservative manner throughout the analysis,\nactual compliance costs may differ to the extent that these assumptions do not reflect a given\nregistrant\u2019s specific circumstances.\nThe above compliance cost estimates exhibit certain features that may make them\nconservative. First, the cost estimates from comment letters and other sources, which serve as\ninputs in our cost estimation process, are almost all from large-cap companies. To the extent that\ncompliance costs increase with company size, smaller registrants can expect lower costs.3042\nFurthermore, there are numerous instances in which analytical assumptions were required due to\ninsufficient information from the source material. Wherever possible, assumptions that tend to\noverstate actual costs were chosen over those that would tend to understate them. Certain\nregistrants may nonetheless incur costs that exceed our estimates. However, we believe that due\nto the nature of our cost estimation process, the majority of registrants will incur costs that do not\nexceed our estimates. Furthermore, our estimates assume registrants have no pre-existing\nclimate-related disclosure practices. As a result, those that already provide disclosures that meet\nsome of the final rules\u2019 requirements will face lower incremental costs.3043\n3041 Some commenters provided TCFD disclosure costs and separate costs for sustainability consultants. See,\ne.g., letters from Soc. Corp Gov (June 11, 2021, and June 17, 2022). However, the latter were often not\nexplicitly tied to TCFD, but rather associated with sustainability reports or other disclosures and activities\nnot necessarily required by the final rules. In these cases, we only used the TCFD disclosure costs due to\ntheir direct relevance while omitting the cost of sustainability consultants as we could not reliably\ndetermine what portion were directly attributable to the TCFD and the provisions of interest. For GHG\nemissions, some companies\u2019 estimates included both internal and external costs, some mentioned the use of\nexternal costs but did not provide dollar estimates, while others did not engage external services at all. We\nhave incorporated all available information to the extent possible in our estimation process.\n3042 Nevertheless, we recognize that in some cases, certain components of compliance costs may not vary with\nsize and may be higher in proportional terms for smaller registrants.\n3043 See section IV.C.3.c.\n743\n\nWe recognize that some comment letters in response to the proposed rules contained\ncompliance cost estimates that significantly exceed the Commission\u2019s estimates of the final\nrules.3044 We reiterate that this discrepancy is likely attributable to a number of changes from the\nproposed rules that reduce compliance costs. For example, the final rules do not require Scope 3\nemissions reporting and have less burdensome requirements with respect to the amendments to\nRegulation S-X, thereby resulting in reduced compliance costs.\nOur compliance cost estimation process consists of five elements. First, we estimate the\naggregate costs of complying with three specific provisions that have similar counterparts within\nthe TCFD framework: governance disclosure; disclosure regarding climate-related risks that\nhave material impacts on strategy, business model, and outlook; and risk management disclosure.\nSecond, we estimate the cost of assessing and disclosing Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Third, we\nestimate the cost of obtaining third-party assurance for GHG emissions disclosures. Fourth, we\nestimate the reporting costs of scenario analysis and targets and goals. Fifth, we estimate the\ncosts associated with complying with the amendments to Regulation S-X and incremental audit\ncosts. We proceed with a review of each element that describes how we arrived at the above\ncompliance cost estimates.\ni. Cost estimates of Governance Disclosure; Disclosure Regarding Impacts\nof Climate-Related Risks on Strategy, Business Model, and Outlook; and\nRisk Management Disclosure\nWe begin by reviewing estimates from commenters and other sources with respect to the\ncosts of TCFD disclosure with the objective of informing our assessment on the costs of similar\nprovisions of the final rules. Specifically, these provisions of interest include governance\n3044 See section IV.C.3.c.\n744\n\ndisclosure; disclosure regarding climate-related risks that have material impacts on strategy,\nbusiness model, and outlook; and risk management disclosure. We begin by focusing on these\nspecific provisions separate from other components (e.g., GHG emissions measurement or\ntargets and goals) because these other components are not necessarily required in all\ncircumstances or by all registrants.\nIn many cases, however, commenters provided one aggregate cost for their TCFD\ndisclosure that also included the costs of GHG emissions measurement or target and goals-\nrelated activities. Without a breakdown of component costs, we face challenges in isolating the\ncosts of the relevant provisions. Moreover, some commenters provided only a single aggregate\ncost that, in addition to their TCFD disclosure, includes several other components not required\nby the final rules,3045 which poses similar challenges in separately estimating the component\ncosts.\nTo account for these challenges, we used an approach that takes these aggregate cost\nestimates and applies adjustments derived from specific estimates from other sources, allowing\nus to obtain a more targeted \u201cadjusted cost.\u201d For example, some commenters provided their cost\nestimates specifically for measuring emissions, from which we can determine the median\nreported emissions-measurement cost. Thus, if a given commenter provided an aggregate cost of\nTCFD disclosure that includes the measuring of emissions, we applied an adjustment (i.e.,\nsubtracted the median reported emissions-measurement cost), which results in an adjusted cost\nestimate for the remaining portion of TCFD disclosures (i.e., the provisions of interest). We\napplied similar adjustments throughout the analysis, as described in detail below.\n3045 For example, an anonymous large-cap company \u201cnoted that combined costs for producing its first TCFD,\nSASB, and GRI disclosures were between $200,00 and $350,000.\u201d See supra note 2987.\n745\n\nWhile this approach can help us arrive at more granular cost estimates, we also recognize\nits limitations. Primarily, the median reported cost of a given component may be different from\nthe actual cost incurred by a specific registrant (due to differences in company size, industry,\nclimate reporting practices, or other factors) such that applying the adjustment may not yield a\ntrue representation of that registrant\u2019s cost breakdown. However, we believe this issue is\nmitigated to some extent because almost all estimates used in this analysis are from large cap\ncompanies and thus of relatively comparable size. Furthermore, while a given cost adjustment\nmay be overstated for some registrants and understated for others, these discrepancies should\npartially offset each other when we subsequently take the median3046 of the resulting adjusted\ncosts.\nTable 8 presents an overview of the cost estimation methodology with respect to the\nprovisions of interest. Column (1) specifies the commenter or other public source that contains\ncost estimates specific to TCFD disclosures. Some sources contained costs for multiple,\nanonymous companies. Where applicable, these company descriptions are provided in Column\n(2). Column (3) shows the ongoing costs of TCFD disclosures before cost adjustments are\napplied. Some costs are taken directly from the source, whereas in other cases, specific\nassumptions and calculations are applied to obtain an estimate (see table footnotes for details).\nFor example, if a source provided estimates in the form of FTEs or burden hours, we converted\nthem to dollars according to hourly cost estimates consistent with the PRA.3047 Some sources\nonly provided an initial cost (i.e., first-year startup cost) without providing ongoing, annual costs.\n3046 Throughout the cost estimation process, we use medians instead of means since the former is less sensitive\nto outliers.\n3047 The PRA assumes that internal burden hours cost $444/hour, while external burden hours cost $600/hour.\nSee section V.\n746\n\nIn these cases, we estimate the ongoing cost by applying a percentage reduction derived from\nother sources. Furthermore, because the CDP questionnaire exhibits full alignment with the\nTCFD recommendations,3048 we also included estimates for responding to the CDP\nquestionnaire, from which we estimated the equivalent cost for TCFD disclosures by applying a\nconversion factor.3049\nWe determined that some of the costs in Column (3) include the costs of setting targets\nand goals or measuring GHG emissions, as indicated in Columns (4) and (5), respectively.\nWhere applicable, these costs are subtracted from Column (3) to obtain the adjusted cost in\nColumn (6), which represents the aggregate, annual ongoing cost estimate for provisions of\ninterest: governance disclosure; disclosure regarding climate-related risks that have material\nimpacts on strategy, business model, and outlook; and risk management disclosure.\n3048 For information on how the CDP questionnaire is fully aligned with the TCFD, see CDP, How CDP is\naligned to the TCFD, supra note 52.\n3049 Two companies referenced in comment letters noted that it takes a designated number of staff four months\nto complete the CDP questionnaire and nine months to complete TCFD disclosures. Based on these\nestimates, we incorporate the assumption that the CDP-to-TCFD cost ratio is 4 to 9 (\u201c4-to-9 ratio\u201d). See\nletters from Soc. Corp. Gov. (June 11, 2021 and June 17, 2022).\n747\n\nTable 8.

The adjustment factor for setting targets and goals is $54,015, which is determined by relevant cost estimates\npresented in Table 9.\n2. The adjustment factor for assessing Scope 1, Scope 2, and some Scope 3 emissions is $79,236, which is\ndetermined by relevant cost estimates presented in Table 10.\n3. The adjusted cost is calculated as Column (3) minus adjustment factors where applicable, as indicated by\nColumns (4) and (5). If Column (4) indicates \u201cIncluded,\u201d then $54,015 is subtracted from Column (3).\nSimilarly, if Column (5) indicates \u201cIncluded,\u201d then $79,236 is subtracted from Column (3). The net result is\nthe \u201cadjusted cost,\u201d presented in Column (6).\n4. See letter from Soc. Corp. Gov (June 11, 2021). This company reported that three FTEs \u201cplus others\u201d spend\nnine months for TCFD reporting. (3 FTEs)*(40 hrs/wk)*(36 wks)*($444/hr) = $1,918,080. The source does\nnot specify how many hours are contributed by the \u201cothers,\u201d thus the estimated cost may be understated.\n5. See id. This company reported TCFD-aligned reporting process involved 40 people from the company and\ntook six months of nearly full-time participation by 20 core team members. (20 FTEs)*(40 hrs/wk)*(24\nwks)*($444/hr) = $8,524,800. The source does not specify how many hours are contributed by those outside\nof the 20 core members, thus the estimated cost may be understated.\n6. See id. This company reported spending $1.25 million on both CDP and TCFD disclosures, in addition to\nseveral other components. We first estimate the TCFD component by applying the 4-to-9 ratio. ($1.25\nmillion)*(9/13) = $865,385.\n7. See letter from Soc. Corp. Gov (June 17, 2022). This company reported spending \u201c$160,000 for CDP and\nother climate-related surveys, including supply chain surveys.\u201d To be conservative, we assume that the\n$160,000 is the cost for CDP only, then apply the 4-to-9 ratio. $160,000*(9/4) = $360,000.\n8. See id. This company reported that \u201ctwo employees focus on climate change, including disclosure, and 1.5\nemployees focus on sustainability reporting overall,\u201d spending nine months on its TCFD report. (3.5\nFTEs)*(40 hrs/wk)*(36 wks)*($444/hr) = $2,237,760.\n9. See supra note2995. This is the ongoing cost of \u201ccoordination of disclosure inputs across functions\u201d (\u00a369,747\nfor larger issuers), which is in line with the TCFD disclosure categories of Governance, Strategy, and Risk\nManagement. This cost is converted to USD based on the 2022 average exchange rate. (\u00a369,747)*(1.2369\nUSD/GBP) = $86,270. This reflects a 56% reduction from initial to ongoing costs, which we consider in\ndetermining the appropriate percentage reduction in subsequent calculations.\n10. See supra note 2996. This figure adds the ongoing costs of disclosure associated with Governance (\u00a39,100),\nStrategy (\u00a313,000), and Risk Management (\u00a310,800). The total (\u00a332,900) is converted to USD based on the\n2022 average exchange rate. (\u00a332,900)*(1.2369 USD/GBP) = $40,694. This reflects a 32% reduction from\ninitial to ongoing costs, which we consider in determining the appropriate percentage reduction in subsequent\ncalculations.\n11. See supra note 2987. This company reported that the cost of issuing its first TCFD report was less than\n$100,000. To be conservative, we assume $100,000 is the initial cost. To estimate ongoing costs, we refer to\nthe percentage reduction from initial to ongoing costs as reflected by the FCA rule (56%) and the BEIS rule\n(32%), of which the median is 44%. ($100,000)*(1 \u2013 0.44) = $56,000.\n12. See id. This company reported that the cost of producing its first TCFD report was less than $10,000. To be\nconservative, we assume $10,000 is the initial cost. In estimating ongoing costs, we refer to the percentage\nreduction from initial to ongoing costs as reflected by the FCA rule (56%) and the BEIS rule (32%), of which\nthe median is 44%. $10,000*(1 \u2013 0.44) = $5,600.\n749\n\n13. See id. This company reported that the combined cost for producing their first TCFD, SASB, and GRI\ndisclosures was between $200,000 and $350,000 but did not provide the cost for TCFD only. However, it\nnoted that the cost of preparing its first CDP questionnaire did not exceed $50,000. To be conservative, we\nassume the initial CDP-related cost is $50,000. We apply the 4-to-9 ratio to convert this to the initial costs of\nTCFD disclosure and then apply a 44% reduction to estimate the ongoing cost. $50,000*(9/4)*(1 \u2013 0.44) =\n$63,000.\n14. See letter from AEPC. This commenter stated that initial costs to report in alignment with certain aspects of\nthe TCFD can be around $500,000. To estimate ongoing costs, we refer to the percentage reduction from\ninitial to ongoing costs as reflected by the FCA rule (56%) and the BEIS rule (32%), of which the median is\n44%. $500,000*(1 \u2013 0.44) = $280,000.\n15. See supra note 3021. This source, which provided indicative fees for TCFD reporting services, noted that the\naverage cost would be around $100,000. To estimate ongoing costs, we refer to the percentage reduction\nfrom initial to ongoing costs as reflected by the FCA rule (56%) and the BEIS rule (32%), of which the\nmedian is 44%. $100,000*(1 \u2013 0.44) = $56,000.\n16. When there is an even number of data points, there is no single middle value. In such cases, the median is\ncomputed as the arithmetic mean of the two middle data points. Accordingly, the median of Column (6) is\ncalculated as follows: ($86,270 + $280,000)/2 = $183,135.\nWe next discuss our estimation process and methodology involved in producing the\nnumbers in Table 8, including which cost estimates were included versus excluded, what\nassumptions were incorporated, and how the adjustment factors for targets and goals and GHG\nemissions measurement were calculated and applied. Many commenters did not explicitly state\nwhether the costs of measuring emissions or setting targets and goals were included in their\nTCFD costs. As a result, we assumed that such costs were included only if such activities were\ncontained in their qualitative description of climate-related disclosure activities. Of the twelve\ncost estimates presented in Table 8, we assume that three included the cost of target-related\n750\n\nactivities, as indicated in Column (4).3050 We also assume that five estimates included the costs\nof measuring Scope 1, Scope 2, and some Scope 3 emissions, as indicated in Column (5).3051\nWe next review cost estimates specific to setting targets and goals and assessing GHG\nemissions (Scope 1, Scope 2, and some Scope 3) from other sources in order to obtain their\nadjustment factors ($54,015 and $79,236, respectively). We recognize that the final rules do not\nnecessarily require registrants to incur costs associated with setting targets and goals or\nmeasuring all three scopes of GHG emissions. We review such cost estimates because we\ndetermined that some of the sources in Table 8 included them with their overall TCFD-related\ncosts; however, they should not necessarily be interpreted as direct compliance costs resulting\nfrom the final rules. Instead, we use these cost estimates to obtain appropriate adjustment factors\nthat are subsequently subtracted from the applicable estimates in Column (3).\n3050 The Financial Services company stated that it \u201creports on its progress towards its low-carbon financing and\ncarbon-neutrality goals; the percentage of renewable energy sourced to support its operations and the\npercentage of energy reductions year over year.\u201d The Communication Services company reports that it\ngathers metrics/data related to carbon abatement, renewable energy, water conservation, and incurs\nexpenses for monitoring and data quality. (See letter from Soc. Corp. Gov (June 11, 2021)). Company 6\nstated that it \u201cgathers data and reports on progress towards the company\u2019s low-carbon financing goal,\nprogress toward the company\u2019s carbon-neutrality goal, the percentage of renewable energy sourced to\nsupport the company\u2019s operations, the percentage of energy reduction year-over-year.\u201d (See letter from\nSoc. Corp. Gov (June 17, 2022)). Based on the description of these activities, we assume that these three\ncompanies included the costs of setting targets and goals in their reported costs. The Large-cap financial\ninstitution stated that it \u201cis committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 and is in the process of\nimplementing the Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment (PACTA) methodology to align its loan\nportfolio with the goals of the Paris Agreement.\u201d See supra note 2987. However, given their relatively low\nreported costs, we assume that the cost of setting targets and goals is not included in order to remain\nconservative in our estimation.\n3051 The Financial Services company, Communications Services company, Company 5, and Company 6 all\nexplicitly state that they measure and report Scopes 1, 2, and some Scope 3 emissions. The Energy\ncompany does not explicitly state that it measures emissions, however it states that it requires \u201cconsultants\nin emissions, climate science, and modeling,\u201d \u201cmultiple engineering disciplines,\u201d and \u201cGHG emissions\nreporting expertise\u201d as part of its disclosures. See letters from Soc. Corp. Gov (June 11, 2021 and June 17,\n2022). Thus, we assume that these five companies included the costs of measuring Scope 1, 2, and some\nScope 3 emissions within their reported costs. The Large-cap financial institution and Mid-cap company\nalso report measuring the three scopes of emissions, however given their relatively low reported costs, we\nassume that the cost of measuring emissions is not included in order to remain conservative in our\nestimation.\n751\n\nThe adjustment factor for setting targets and goals is $54,015, as indicated in Column (4).\nTo obtain this number, we begin by reviewing four sources that provided more specific cost\nestimates related to targets and goals,3052 which are presented in Table 9. The BEIS rule\nestimated that Metrics and Targets (including the cost of data gathering and cost of reporting,\nunrelated to GHG emissions) would have an ongoing cost of $72,359, while the FCA rule\nestimated the ongoing cost to be $53,507.\nThe remaining two sources only provided initial costs. Thus, to estimate the ongoing\ncost, we referred to the percent reduction from initial to ongoing costs reflected by the BEIS rule\n(23 percent reduction) and FCA rule (67 percent reduction), which yields a median percent\nreduction of 45 percent. One source estimated that setting targets would come with an initial\ncost ranging from $20,000 to $30,000.3053 We apply the 45 percent reduction to arrive at an\nongoing cost estimate of $13,750. Another company reported that it spent $1 million as an initial\ncost for target baseline and projections.3054 We similarly apply the 45 percent reduction to arrive\nat an ongoing cost estimate of $550,000. The median of the ongoing costs of setting targets in\nTable 9 is $54,015, which is used as the adjustment factor for setting targets and goals (as\nindicated in Column (4) of Table 9).\n3052 These sources generally do not provide sufficient detail on precisely what the targets and goals disclosure\nwould consist of; therefore, it is difficult to determine to what extent the corresponding cost estimates are\napplicable to the final rules\u2019 requirements on targets and goals. We can nevertheless use these sources to\nhelp us arrive at better informed compliance cost estimates. Similar reasoning can be applied to the cost\nestimates of scenario analysis, discussed in section IV.C.3.b.iv.\n3053 See supra note 3021.\n3054 See letter from Soc. Corp. Gov. (June 17, 2022).\n752\n\nTable 9.

See supra note 2996. The BEIS rule estimated that the ongoing cost metrics and targets disclosure is \u00a358,500\n(\u00a352,000 for annual data gathering and \u00a36,500 for the cost of reporting). We apply the 2022 average\nexchange rate. (\u00a358,500)*(1.2369 USD/GBP) = $72,359. This reflects a 23% reduction from initial to\nongoing costs, which we consider in determining the appropriate percentage reduction in subsequent\ncalculations.\n2. See supra note 2995. The FCA rule estimated that ongoing costs for metrics and targets disclosure is\n\u00a343,259; however, this figure includes assessing Scopes 1 and 2 emissions. The corresponding initial cost\ndisaggregates the cost, with two-thirds allocated to metrics and targets unrelated to Scopes 1 and 2 emissions.\nWe assume the ongoing cost reflects the same proportional allocation and then we apply the 2022 average\nexchange rate. (\u00a343,259)*(2/3)*(1.2369 USD/GBP) = $35,671. This reflects a 67% reduction from initial to\nongoing costs, which we consider in determining the appropriate percentage reduction in subsequent\ncalculations.\n3. See letter from Soc. Corp. Gov (June 17, 2022). \u201cCompany 7\u201d in this comment letter reported that it spent $1\nmillion on \u201cbuilding a database for target baseline and projections,\u201d but did not provide the ongoing cost. To\nestimate the ongoing cost, we refer to the percentage reduction from initial to ongoing costs as reflected by\nthe BEIS rule (23%) and the FCA rule (67%), of which the median is 45%. ($1,000,000)*(1 \u2013 0.45) =\n$550,000.\n4. See supra note 3021. The S&P Global meeting memorandum provides estimates on the initial cost of setting\ntarget ($20,000 - $30,000) but does not provide estimates with respect to the ongoing cost. To estimate the\nongoing cost, we refer to the percentage reduction from initial to ongoing costs as reflected by the BEIS rule\n(23%) and the FCA rule (67%), of which the median is 45%. We apply this median percentage reduction to\nthe midpoint of the initial cost: ($25,000)*(1 \u2013 0.45) = $13,750.\nNext, we focus on the adjustment factor for assessing Scope 1, Scope 2, and some Scope\n3 emissions (as indicated in Column (5) of Table 8). To obtain this number, we review eight\nrelevant estimates, which are presented in Table 10. Where necessary, modifications or\nassumptions are applied to the estimates (see table footnotes for details). Lastly, we take the\nmedian of these eight data points to obtain the adjustment factor for measuring Scope 1, Scope 2,\nand some Scope 3 emissions: $79,236. We reiterate that the final rules do not require the\ndisclosure of Scope 1 and 2 emissions in all cases or from all registrants, and Scope 3 disclosures\nare not required. We reviewed these emissions cost in this section because we subtract them\n753\n\nfrom applicable estimates in Column (3) of Table 8, which we have deemed to include emissions\ncosts.\nTable 10. Ongoing costs of measuring Scope 1, Scope 2, and some Scope 3 emissions\nOngoing costs of measuring\nCommenter or Source Company Scope 1, Scope 2, and some\n(if specified)\nScope 3 emissions\nCompany 9 $200,000 1\nSociety for Corporate Governance\n(June 17, 2022) Company 10 $83,472 2\nCompany 11 $75,000 3\nERM Survey $182,985 4\nAir Products and Chemicals, Inc. $4,032,000 5\nPersefoni $50,000 6\nS&P Global $40,000 7\nSouth Pole $23,184 8\n1. See letter from Soc. Corp. Gov. (June 17, 2022). Company 9 discloses Scope 1 and Scope 2 and some\nScope 3 GHG emissions but does not specify which categories of Scope 3 emissions are reported. The\ncompany \u201cconducts the emissions inventory/data gathering in-house at an estimated cost of at least\n$200,000 annually.\u201d Thus, we assume that $200,000 is the ongoing cost of measuring Scope 1, Scope 2,\nand some Scope 3 emissions. This estimate may be understated as it is presented as a minimum cost.\n2. See id. Company 10 discloses Scope 1 and Scope 2 and some Scope 3 (fuel and energy-related activities,\nbusiness travel, and use of sold products) GHG emissions. Approximately five to seven staff members\nare involved with the emissions calculations and reporting to various agencies and for verification. The\ncompany estimates 188 hours for emissions gathering/annual operating reporting across the company\u2019s\nutility and gas infrastructure business unit and preparing its final verification support. Thus, we assume\nthe 188 burden hours is the ongoing costs of measuring the specified scopes of emissions. (188\nhours)*($444/hr) = $83,472.\n3. See id. Company 11 discloses Scope 1, Scope 2, and some Scope 3 (business travel, commuting, waste,\ndownstream leased assets) GHG emissions. The company estimated its internal time and external\nresources associated with emissions inventory/data gathering to be about $75,000 annually.\n4. See ERM survey. The ERM survey indicated that the average spend for GHG analysis and/or disclosures\nis $237,000 annually. This survey category included all costs related to developing GHG inventories,\nincluding analysis and disclosure of Scope 1, Scope 2, and/or Scope 3 emissions. This category also\nincluded preparation of GHG data for inclusion in public reporting, any analysis related to setting\nscience-based targets, and other similar efforts to understand GHG emissions. Because this estimate\nincludes targets, we subtract the median ongoing cost of targets ($54,015), as reported in Table 9.\n$237,000 - $54,015 = $182,985.\n754\n\n5. See letter from Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. This company reports Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3\nemissions, but does not specify which categories of Scope 3. The company\u2019s emissions reporting process\nrequires one full-time consultant and 20 employees working part-time each year from Nov. to Mar. (1\nfull-time consultant)*(40 hrs/wk)*(20 weeks)*($600/hr) + (20 employees)*(20 hrs/wk)*(20\nwks)*($444/hr) = $4,032,000. However, this estimate may be overstated because it includes the cost of\nthird-party limited assurance for GHG emissions.\n6. See supra note 3023. Persefoni estimates that the cost of assessing Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3\nemissions for companies of \u201chigh maturity\u201d (i.e., those that are already measuring/tracking Scope 1,\nScope 2, and Scope 3 emissions, among other activities) is $50,000, which we assume to reflect ongoing\ncosts. The commenter further estimates that the corresponding cost for companies that do not already\nmeasure/track such emissions would be $125,000. If this figure is assumed to represent initial costs, then\nthe estimates reflect a 60% reduction from initial to ongoing costs, which we consider in determining the\nappropriate percentage reduction in subsequent calculations.\n7. See supra note 3021. S&P Global estimated that the cost of assessing Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3\nemissions for the first time is between $75,000 and $125,000. We take the midpoint of this range\n($100,000) and apply the same percent reduction (60%) reflected in the Persefoni meeting memorandum\nto estimate ongoing costs. $100,000*(1 \u2013 0.6) = $40,000.\n8. See South Pole Memo. South Pole indicated that conducting a bottom-up assessment of Scope 1, Scope\n2, and Scope 3 emissions for the first time can cost between \u20ac10,000 and \u20ac100,000. We take the\nmidpoint (\u20ac55,000), apply the 2022 average exchange rate ($1.0538 USD/\u20ac), and apply the same percent\nreduction (60% reduction) reflected in the Persefoni meeting memorandum to estimate ongoing costs.\n(\u20ac55,000)*(1.0538 USD/\u20ac)*(1 \u2013 0.6) = $23,184.\nThere were other commenters and sources that contained individual cost estimates\nspecific to only Scope 1,3055 Scopes 1 and 2 combined,3056 or only Scope 3 emissions\nmeasurement,3057 as opposed to an aggregate cost that combines all three scopes. However,\nbecause we determined that all estimates indicated by Column (5) of Table 8 include the\naggregate cost of all three scopes of emissions and to remain conservative in our estimation, we\nopted not to use estimates of individual scopes of emissions for comparability.3058\n3055 See letters from Soc. Corp. Gov. (June 17, 2022); and IDFA.\n3056 See supra notes 3021, 3023, and 2995; see also letter from IDFA.\n3057 See letters from Williams, Inc.; and \u00d8rsted.\n3058 In some cases, commenters\u2019 estimates of assessing Scope 1 emissions are greater than other commenters\u2019\ncombined estimates of assessing Scope 1, Scope 2, and some Scope 3 emissions. However, because the\nresulting adjustment factor will be subtracted from Column (3) of Table 8 to obtain compliance costs, we\ndo not include the greater Scope 1 cost estimates in order to remain conservative and to avoid understating\nfinal compliance costs. In the following subsection, however, we include these cost estimates when\nestimating the combined costs of Scopes 1 and 2 emissions in a similar bid to remain conservative.\n755\n\nWe have so far obtained the adjustment factors for setting targets and goals ($54,015) and\nmeasuring Scope 1, Scope 2, and some Scope 3 emissions ($79,236). We next subtract these\namounts, where applicable, from Column (3), from which the result is presented as the adjusted\ncost in Column (6). The median of the adjusted costs is $183,135. We next extrapolate the\ninitial cost using the assumption of a 44 percent cost reduction3059 from the first year to\nsubsequent years of these corresponding disclosures. Thus, we estimate that the aggregate\ncompliance costs for governance disclosure; disclosure regarding climate-related risks that have\nmaterial impacts on strategy, business model, and outlook; and risk management disclosure are\n$327,000 for the first year and $183,000 for subsequent years (rounded to the nearest\n$1,000).3060\nThere were additional estimates associated with TCFD disclosure costs that were\nultimately not included in this analysis, mainly due to the lack of details needed to obtain a\nquantitative estimate.3061 For example, one commenter stated that their \u201cHead of Corporate ESG\nStrategy and Reporting leads a team of employees that required seven months to gather data and\ndraft disclosures for our 2021 TCFD Report in coordination with numerous subject matter\nexperts across our entire organization.\u201d3062 However, the commenter did not specify how many\n3059 As noted earlier in this subsection, the FCA rule and BEIS rule reflect a 56 % and 32 % reduction in cost,\nrespectively, from initial year to subsequent years regarding the provisions of interest (i.e., governance\ndisclosure; disclosure regarding climate-related risks that have material impacts on strategy, business\nmodel, and outlook; and risk management disclosure). The median, 44 %, is used to estimate the initial\ncost.\n3060 No commenters or sources offered estimates specific to the cost of the disclosure of material expenditures\ndirectly related to climate-related activities as part of a registrant\u2019s strategy, transition plan and/or targets\nand goals. Nevertheless, the Commission\u2019s estimates (i.e., $327,000 for the first year and $183,000\nannually in subsequent years) should reflect this cost based on our application of conservative assumptions\nand because of the small expected incremental cost given that registrants will likely be tracking the material\nexpenditures under the financial statement disclosure requirements.\n3061 See, e.g., letters from Soc. Corp. Gov. (June 11, 2021); Nasdaq; Chamber; and AEPC.\n3062 See letter from Nasdaq.\n756\n\nstaff or FTEs are involved, which precludes us from reliably calculating burden hours and\nassociated costs. Another commenter asserted that the \u201cactual cost for complete alignment to\nTCFD could be up to $1,000,000 per registrant over several years.\u201d Because the commenter did\nnot provide the number of years, however, we are unable to obtain the annual costs.3063 Other\nsources provided costs that had general descriptions (e.g., \u201cimplementation costs\u201d or \u201ctwo\nFTEs\u2026 dedicated to climate reporting\u201d) that did not explicitly mention \u201cTCFD\u201d disclosures.3064\nWe similarly did not include such estimates given that we cannot reliably infer whether these\ncosts are reflective of TCFD disclosures and the specific provisions of interest.\nii. Cost estimates of Scope 1 and 2 emissions disclosures\nThe final rules require the disclosure of Scope 1 and 2 emissions, if material, by LAFs\nand AFs, while SRCs and EGCs are exempt.3065 To inform our assessment of the associated\ncost, we review comment letters and other sources that contain relevant estimates, presented in\nTable 11. We note that three of the estimates are specific to the cost of assessing Scope 1\nemissions only.3066 Nevertheless, we include them in Table 11 because (a) these Scope 1\nemissions cost estimates are generally higher than other estimates that include both Scope 1 and\n2 emissions, and (b) the costs can only increase if the Scope 1 emissions estimates are adjusted to\nalso account for Scope 2 emissions (i.e., they are understated with respect to the cost of both\nScope 1 and 2 emissions). Thus, we include the Scope 1 emissions cost estimates to remain\nconservative in our estimation.\n3063 See letter from AEPC.\n3064 See, e.g., letters from RILA; Nutrien; and Soc. Corp. Gov. (June 11, 2021).\n3065 See 17 CFR 229.1505(a)(1).\n3066 The cost estimates that are specific to Scope 1 only are those from the Society for Corporate Governance\n(Company 4), Energy Transfer LP, and IDFA ($100,000).\n757\n\n758\n\nTable 11.

See supra note 3023. Persefoni estimated that the ongoing cost is $25,000. This reflects a 44% cost reduction\nfrom its initial cost estimate, which we consider in determining the appropriate percentage reduction in\nsubsequent calculations.\n2. See supra note 2995. The FCA estimates initial costs to be \u00a343,259, which is converted to dollars based on\nthe 2022 average exchange rate. (\u00a343,259)*(1.2369 USD/GBP) = $53,507. The ongoing costs, however, are\nnot explicitly provided, but instead are grouped with another disclosure component. Because the initial costs\nmake up one third of the total initial cost when combined with this other component, we assume that the\nsame proportion holds with respect to ongoing costs. $53,507/3 = $17,836. This reflects a 67% cost reduction\nfrom its initial cost estimate, which we consider in determining the appropriate percentage reduction in\nsubsequent calculations.\n3. See supra note 3021.\n4. See letter from IDFA. One unnamed company reported that it spends between 100 and 200 hours to maintain\nautomated GHG aggregation and reporting software system for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. We take the\nmidpoint of the burden hours and convert to dollars based on $444/hr. (150 hours)*($444/hr) = $66,600.\n5. See id. Another unnamed company reported that it spends about $100,000 to maintain its GHG measuring\nsystem, with the context suggesting that this is specific to Scope 1 emissions. Although this estimate does not\ninclude the cost of assessing Scope 2, it is nevertheless included to remain conservative in our estimation.\n6. See letter from Energy Transfer LP. This company stated that although it already tracks Scope 1 emissions to\nsome degree, the incremental costs to comply with the proposed rules would be approximately $7 million in\n2006 dollars, which is equivalent to $10,162,035 in 2022 dollars. However, because this is only the\nincremental cost, it is presumably understated with respect to the full cost (i.e., incremental costs are a subset\nof the full cost of disclosure). It is further understated since the estimate is specific to Scope 1 emissions\nonly, whereas we seek to estimate the costs of assessing Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Nevertheless, because this\nestimate is greater than the other estimates in Table 11, it is included to remain conservative in our\nestimation.\n7. See letter from Soc. Corp. Gov (June 17, 2022). This company estimated that it requires roughly $300,000\nannually in staff time for its Scope 1 data collection and reporting. Although this estimate does not include\nthe cost of assessing Scope 2, it is nevertheless included to remain conservative in our estimation.\nThe median ongoing cost of assessing Scope 1 and 2 emissions in Table 11 is $66,600.\nTo estimate the initial cost, we refer to two sources that reported both initial and ongoing costs to\ninform our assessment of the percentage reduction between the two costs. One organization\u2019s\nestimated costs reflect a reduction of 44 percent3067 while another\u2019s reflect a reduction of 67\npercent.3068 We use the median (56 percent) to extrapolate the initial cost. As a result, we\n3067 See supra note 3023; see also footnote 1 in Table 11.\n3068 See supra note 2995; see also footnote 2 in Table 11.\n760\n\nestimate that the cost of assessing Scope 1 and 2 emissions is $151,0003069 for the first year and\n$67,000 for subsequent years (rounded to the nearest $1,000).\niii. Cost estimates of assurance for Scope 1 and 2 emissions disclosures\nWith respect to Scope 1 and 2 emissions disclosures, the final rules require assurance at\ndifferent levels (limited or reasonable) with different phase in periods depending on whether the\nregistrant is an LAF or AF, while SRCs and EGCs are exempt.3070 To assess the costs of\nassurance, we reviewed comment letters that provided relevant, quantitative cost estimates, as\npresented in Table 12.\nThe estimates displayed varying degrees of assurance \u201ccoverage\u201d (i.e., which specific\ndisclosures were being assured). Some commenters reported assurance costs but did not\nexplicitly define what climate-related disclosure items were being assured.3071 In such cases, we\napplied the conservative assumption that the reported assurance costs were specific to their GHG\nemissions disclosures only. Other estimates were specifically attributed to Scope 1 and 2\nemissions,3072 consistent with the final rules\u2019 requirements, where applicable. The majority of\nestimates, however, pertained to the combined assurance costs for all three scopes of\nemissions,3073 which presumably overstate the assurance costs for Scope 1 and 2 emissions only.\nNevertheless, we include these estimates for two reasons: first, we included them because we\ncannot reliably isolate the assurance costs for Scope 1 and 2 emissions only (i.e., by excluding\n3069 ($66,600)/(1-0.56) = $151,364.\n3070 See supra section II.I.\n3071 See, e.g., letters from Soc. Corp. Gov (June 11, 2021 and June 17, 2022); and Persefoni.\n3072 See, e.g., letters from Soc. Corp. Gov (June 17, 2022); and IDFA.\n3073 See, e.g., letters from Soc. Corp. Gov (June 11, 2021 and June 17, 2022).\n761\n\nScope 3 emissions); and second, by including costs that are overstated relative to what the final\nrules require, we remain conservative in our estimation.\nOther commenters, however, stated that their assurance cost estimates covered both their\nGHG emissions and the proposed financial statement disclosures.3074 It is likely that a\nsignificant portion of these costs is attributable to the proposed financial statement disclosures,\nwhich several commenters stated would come with high costs.3075 We therefore did not include\nthese estimates as they are less likely to be representative of assurance costs for Scope 1 and 2\nonly compared to other aggregate estimates.\nThe estimates also varied in the level of assurance, with most estimates equally split\nbetween either limited assurance or not specifying the level assurance. To be conservative, any\nestimates that did not specify the level of assurance were assumed to be limited assurance. One\ncommenter estimated only the incremental cost of switching from limited to reasonable\nassurance.3076 While we cannot infer the actual costs of either limited or reasonable assurance in\nthis case, we nevertheless include the incremental cost because it is relatively high, allowing us\nto remain conservative in our estimation.\n3074 See letters from Soc. Corp.

See letter from Soc. Corp. Gov (June 11, 2021). The Basic Materials company reported spending\n$30,000 for assurance over its Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions without specifying the level of\nassurance.\n2. See id. The Communication Services (\u201cComm. Services\u201d) company, which discloses Scope 1, 2,\nand 3 emissions (among other climate-related disclosures), reported that assurance costs are\napproximately $600,000 annually without specifying the coverage or level of assurance.\n3. See id. The Health Care company, which discloses Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 (among other\nclimate-related disclosures), reported that assurance costs are $22,000 without specifying the\ncoverage or level of assurance.\n4. See letter from Soc. Corp. Gov (June 17, 2022). Company 1 reported spending over $400,000 for\n\u201climited assurance from a public company accounting firm over select environmental metrics\ndisclosed in its sustainability report, including its Scope 1, 2 (location- based and market-based),\nand Scope 3 (including a comparison against the base year) GHG emissions; total energy\nconsumed; percentage grid electricity; percentage renewable energy; and water usage.\u201d\n5. See id. Company 3 currently pays $13,000 annually for limited assurance over its Scope 1, Scope 2,\nand one category of Scope 3 emissions. The cost estimated may be understated given that this\ncompany believes that its current assurance may not be in compliance with the proposed rules and\nthat costs may increase if the rule is adopted as proposed.\n6. See id. Company 5 reported spending over $45,000 annually for \u201climited assurance from a\nprofessional audit firm for disclosure in its sustainability report of its Scope 1 and 2 GHG\nemissions and defined categories of its Scope 3 GHG emissions (exclusive of processing and use\nof, and end-of-life treatment for, sold products, and certain other downstream activities).\u201d\n7. See id. Company 6 reported spending $15,000 annually for assurance over its Scope 1 and 2\nemissions and certain Scope 3 operational emissions (such as emissions associated with business\ntravel and downstream leased assets) without specifying the level of assurance.\n8. See id. Company 7 reported spending $50,000 annually for assurance over its Scope 1, Scope 2,\nand some categories of Scope 3 emissions without specifying the level of assurance.\n9. See id. Company 8 reported spending between $10,000 and $15,000 annually for assurance over its\nScope 1 and 2 emissions. We include the midpoint of this range in the table ($12,500).\n10. See id. Company 9 reported spending $10,000 for reasonable assurance over its Scope 1, Scope 2,\nand some Scope 3 emissions. It also noted that another firm offered to do the same work for\n$180,000. To be conservative, we use this higher estimate instead. Next, we extrapolate the cost of\nlimited assurance based on a comment letter, which states that the cost of reasonable assurance\ncould be 2-3 times higher than limited assurance. See letter from Center for Climate and Energy\nSolutions. By taking the midpoint (2.5), we estimate the cost of limited assurance: $180,000/2.5 =\n$72,000.\n11. See id. Company 10 reported spending $15,000 annually for limited assurance over its Scope 1,\nScope 2, and partial Scope 3 (fuel and energy-related activities and business travel) emissions.\n12. See id. Company 11 reported spending $15,000 annually for limited assurance over its Scope 1,\nScope 2, and some Scope 3 (business travel, commuting, waste, downstream leased assets)\nemissions.\n13. See id. Company 12 reported spending $30,000 for limited assurance over its Scope 1, 2, and 3\nemissions. It also noted that another firm offered to do the same work for $75,000. To be\nconservative, we use this higher estimate instead.\n14. See id. Company 13 reported spending $550,000 for limited assurance over its Scope 1, 2, and 3\nemissions.\n15. See ERM survey. The ERM survey indicates that 28 respondents spend an average of $82,000 for\nassurance/audits related to climate. According to the commenter, this \u201csurvey did not ask issuer\nrespondents to include details of the specific level of assurance or the scope of business practices\n764\n\ncovered, whether assurance covered all locations or all business units, or whether it consisted of\nlimited or reasonable assurance. The costs reported by issuer respondents may include third-party\nassurance of Scope 1 and/or 2 GHG emissions metrics, financial metrics, or both.\u201d Although the\nlevel and coverage of assurance are unspecified, we apply the conservative assumption that the\nreported cost pertains to limited assurance of Scope 1 and 2 emissions.\n16. See letter from IDFA. An unnamed, privately held company reported that it discloses Scope 1 and 2\nemissions. It further states that it spends between \u201c$50,000-$75,000 or more that is necessary to\nperiodically hire a 3rd party consultant to review and re-validate the company\u2019s internal systems.\u201d\nThe level of assurance is unspecified. We include the midpoint of this range in the table ($62,500).\n17. See letter from Salesforce. This commenter did not provide actual costs of limited or reasonable\nassurance, but it estimated that its incremental cost of switching from limited to reasonable\nassurance over its Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions could range from $1 to 3 million. We include this\nincremental cost since it serves as a lower bound for its reasonable assurance costs. We take the\nmidpoint of this range ($2 million) and convert to limited assurance (see footnote 10 of this table):\n($2 million)/2.5 = $800,000. This estimate is understated considering that it is derived from the\nincremental cost as opposed to actual cost.\nTable 12 presents the cost estimates of limited assurance from commenters, with any\nadjustments or assumptions explained in the table footnotes. The median of these estimates\n($50,000) is subsequently used to extrapolate the cost of reasonable assurance. One commenter\nstated that reasonable assurance may cost two to three times more than limited assurance, based\non input from stakeholders with expertise in developing GHG inventories for companies.3077 We\nuse the upper end of this range and assume that reasonable assurance is three times the cost of\nlimited assurance. As a result, we estimate that the cost of limited assurance for Scope 1 and\nScope 2 emissions disclosures is $50,000, while the cost for reasonable assurance is $150,000.\nCosts may vary, however, depending on the type of assurance provider. Specifically,\nassurance provided by a registered public accounting firm may cost more than if it were provided\nby a different type of service provider. However, the final rules do not require assurance to be\nobtained from a registered public accounting firm.3078 Conversely, costs may be lower if a\n3077 See letter from Center for Climate and Energy Solutions.\n3078 One commenter suggested that most registrants will nevertheless seek assurance from registered public\naccounting firms to comply with the proposed rules. See letter from Soc. Corp. Gov. (June 17, 2022). To\nthe extent that this is also true of the final rules, registrants may incur higher assurance costs.\n765\n\nregistrant uses its auditor to also provide assurance over its GHG emissions disclosures rather\nthan contracting with a different third-party. We also note that some of the companies listed in\nTable 12 indicated that they were unsure as to whether their current assurance practices would\nmeet the proposed rules\u2019 requirements.3079 We are likewise unable to make this determination\nwithout additional details on these companies\u2019 assurance practices. If these companies were to\nincur additional costs to meet the final rules\u2019 assurance requirements, the Commissions\u2019\ncompliance cost estimates may be understated in this regard. However, we believe that our\nconservative approach in other aspects (e.g., incorporating assurance costs that cover all three\nscopes of emissions instead of just Scopes 1 and 2 emissions) mitigate this concern.\niv. Estimates of reporting costs for scenario analysis and targets/goals\nWhile the final rules do not require any registrants to undertake activities related to\nscenario analysis or setting targets and goals, they may require the attendant disclosures under\nspecific circumstances,3080 which will result in affected registrants incurring associated reporting\ncosts. To estimate this reporting cost, we first review comment letters and other sources that\ninform our assessment on the costs of undertaking scenario analysis and targets or goals, then\napply the assumption that 10 percent of this cost comprise the reporting cost.3081\nTable 13 presents the relevant sources of the costs of scenario analysis.3082 The FCA rule\nestimates the ongoing cost to be $40,688 for larger issuers. The BEIS rule contains ongoing cost\n3079 See letter from Soc. Corp. Gov (June 17, 2022).\n3080 See sections II.G and II.D.3.\n3081 The BEIS rule estimates that in the first year of compliance, the reporting cost of metrics and targets\ndisclosure is approximately 9.4% of the cost of the \u201cannual data gathering\u201d activity associated with metrics\nand targets (see supra note 2996). We similarly assume that reporting costs are 10% of the cost of\nundertaking the associated activity.\n3082 See supra note 3052.\n766\n\nestimates for two different types of scenario analysis: qualitative ($32,190) and quantitative\n($79,706). Because the final rules allow for registrants to provide disclosures of either type,\nwhere applicable, we include the estimates of both. Finally, a survey indicates that the\nrespondents\u2019 average annual expenditures is $154,000. The median of these ongoing costs is\n$60,197. We next extrapolate the initial cost. Some of the sources provide both the initial and\nongoing cost of scenario analysis (see Table 13 footnotes), from which we determine the median\npercentage cost reduction (50 percent). This implies an initial cost of $120,394. Assuming that\n10 percent of these costs comprise the reporting costs, we estimate that the reporting costs of\nscenario analysis is $12,000 in the initial year and $6,000 annually in subsequent years (rounded\nto the nearest $1,000).\n767\n\nTable 13. Costs of scenario analysis\nCommenter or Source Ongoing cost\nFCA rule $40,688 1\nBEIS rule: qualitative scenario analysis $32,190 2\nBEIS rule: quantitative scenario analysis $79,706 3\nERM survey $154,000 4\n1. See supra note 2995. The FCA rule estimates ongoing costs to be \u00a332,896 for larger issuers, which is\nconverted to dollars based on the 2022 average exchange rate. (\u00a332,896)*(1.2369 USD/GBP) = $40,688. This\nreflects a 50% reduction from the initial cost estimate ($81,377), which we consider in determining the\nappropriate percentage reduction in subsequent calculations.\n2. See supra note 2996. The BEIS rule estimates ongoing costs of qualitative scenario analysis to be \u00a326,025,\nwhich is converted to dollars based on the 2022 average exchange rate. (\u00a326,025)*(1.2369 USD/GBP) =\n$32,190. This reflects a 25% reduction from the initial cost estimate ($42,920), which we consider in\ndetermining the appropriate percentage reduction in subsequent calculations.\n3. See id. The BEIS rule estimates ongoing costs of quantitative scenario analysis to be \u00a364,440 (\u00a352,040 for\nwriting or quantifying scenarios and \u00a312,400 additional cost for quality assurance and internal verification).\nThis is converted to dollars based on the 2022 average exchange rate. (\u00a364,440)*(1.2369 USD/GBP) =\n$79,706. The initial cost estimate is $240,194 (\u00a3112,400 for developing a model for conducting scenario\nanalysis, \u00a369,390 for writing and quantifying scenarios, and \u00a312,400 additional cost for quality assurance and\ninternal verification, converted to dollars based on the 2022 average exchange rate). This reflects a 67%\nreduction from initial to ongoing costs, which we consider in determining the appropriate percentage\nreduction in subsequent calculations.\n4. See ERM survey. The ERM survey indicates that $154,000 is the average of respondents\u2019 expenditures with\nrespect to scenario analysis, which \u201cincludes all costs to a company related to conducting assessments of the\nimpact of climate in the short, medium, or long term using scenario analysis as well as TCFD/CDP disclosure\nof risks and opportunities.\u201d The survey does not include data on initial costs.\nWith respect to the reporting costs of targets and goals disclosure, we refer to Table 9,\nwhich presents the ongoing costs of undertaking targets and goals. The median ongoing cost of\ntargets is $54,015. Using the median percent cost reduction from the initial year (45 percent), we\nextrapolate the initial cost to be $98,209. We assume 10 percent comprise the reporting\n768\n\ncosts.3083 Thus, we estimate that the reporting costs of targets and goals are $10,000 in the initial\nyear of disclosure and $5,000 annually in subsequent years (rounded to the nearest $1,000).\nv. Cost estimates of amendments to Regulation S-X and incremental audit\nfees\nWe reviewed comment letters that provided cost estimates pertaining to the amendments\nto Regulation S-X, which were often in the millions of dollars.3084 We considered these\nestimates, presented in Table 14, when developing our cost estimates but made adjustments to\nreflect the changes made to the final rules,3085 which we expect will substantially reduce the\ncompliance burden compared to the proposal.\nTable 14. Estimated Costs of Amendments to Regulation S-X\nCommenter Cost\n$1.5 \u2013 2.5 million (initial)\nChamber of Commerce1\n$1 \u2013 2 million (ongoing)\nWilliams Companies, Inc. \u201cMillions of dollars\u201d2 (initial)\nWestern Energy Alliance and U.S. Oil and Gas\n> $100 million3 (initial)\nAssociation\n1. The Chamber of Commerce stated that this estimate was provided by one Well-Known Seasoned Issuer it\nconsulted regarding the proposed amendments.\n2. Williams Cos. estimated the costs of implementing the proposed amendments to Regulation S-X would be in\nthe \u201cmillions of dollars\u201d without providing a more specific estimate.\n3. Western Energy Alliance and U.S. Oil and Gas Association stated that this estimate was based on discussions\nwith public companies that estimated costs of over $100 million for large companies when considering the\nneed for new systems and staff training.\n3083 See supra note 3081.\n3084 See, e.g., letters from API; Chamber; NRF; WEA/USOGA; and Williams Cos.\n3085 See section II.K.\n769\n\nWe consider the \u201cmillions of dollars\u201d estimate provided by Williams Companies, Inc. as\nthe median3086 cost estimate. Assuming the range \u201cmillions of dollars\u201d refers to a number less\nthan $10 million but more than $1 million,3087 we take the midpoint of $5 million as the starting\npoint for our estimate of the costs of the proposed Regulation S-X amendments.\nWe believe the $5 million, however, should be adjusted downward as the costs associated\nwith the final rules should be significantly less than the proposed rules. Many of the concerns\nthat commenters expressed about the proposed rules were primarily focused on the expected\nchallenges and costs related to implementing the proposed Financial Impact Metrics, which\nwould have constituted most of the costs associated with the proposed amendments to\nRegulation S-X. Specifically, these commenters expressed concerns about implementing new\naccounting processes, policies, controls, and IT systems to identify and distinguish activities\nrelated to climate-related risks and transition activities from normal routine business activities\nand then to calculate the disclosure threshold and track those impacts on a line-by-line basis.3088\nThese commenters also highlighted challenges posed by the significant number of estimates and\nassumptions that, in their view, would be required to prepare the proposed disclosures.3089\nAs discussed in greater detail above, the final rules have been significantly revised\ncompared to the proposal to reduce burdens on registrants. The final rules do not include the\n3086 See supra note 3046.\n3087 We recognize the possibility that the commenter\u2019s language of \u201cmillions of dollars\u201d may be referring to a\nnumber greater than $10 million. However, if the commenter was referring to \u201ctens of millions\u201d or\n\u201chundreds of millions\u201d of dollars, we assume that the commenter would have stated it as such. Without\nadditional information, we believe it is reasonable to read this comment as meaning less than $10 million.\n3088 See, e.g., letter from NRF (\u201cExisting accounting systems are not designed for tracking and reporting such\ncost impacts, particularly with no meaningful cost threshold, across all line items, because registrants do\nnot have systems in place to collect, calculate, and report these line items, especially at such a granular\nlevel.\u201d).\n3089 See, e.g., letter from Chamber (\u201c[T]he Proposed Rules require untold estimates, assumptions and judgments\nagainst the backdrop of significant data limitations and speculative impacts.\u201d).\n770\n\nproposed Financial Impact Metrics, which should result in a substantial reduction in compliance\ncosts and burdens.3090 For example, registrants will not be required to disclose any impacts to\nthe Statement of Cash Flows. Moreover, registrants will not be required to disclose any impacts\nto revenues, costs savings, or cost reductions, which some commenters stated would be\nparticularly difficult to disclose because such amounts are not currently captured in a registrant\u2019s\nbooks and records.3091 In addition, registrants will not be required to apply the 1% disclosure\nthreshold on a line-by-line basis.\nInstead, the final rules focus the financial statement disclosures on expenditures related to\na narrower category of activities as compared to the proposal: severe weather events and other\nnatural conditions and the purchase and use of carbon offsets and RECs (one type of transition\nactivity).3092 Commenters stated that discrete expenditures of this type are captured in the books\nand records and would be feasible to disclose.3093 Under the final rules, registrants will be\nrequired to apply the 1% disclosure threshold to severe weather events and other natural\nconditions. In addition, instead of applying the 1% disclosure threshold on a line-by-line basis\nthroughout the financial statements as would have been required under the proposed rules, the\n1% disclosure threshold will be applied only to two amounts under the final rules to determine if\n3090 See letter from Williams Cos. (\u201cAccounting for climate impacts would require companies to write entirely\nnew and significant accounting policies, design and implement new controls, and develop and potentially\npay for new software.\u201d).\n3091 See, e.g., letters from Chamber (stating that \u201cGAAP financial statement line-items do not include amounts\nfor lost revenues, cost savings, or cost reductions\u201d); and Williams Cos. (stating that \u201clost revenue\u201d does not\nexist under GAAP).\n3092 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(c), (d), and (e).\n3093 See letters from Autodesk (noting that if a fire or storm destroys a registrant\u2019s facilities, the associated\ncosts, impairments, and contingencies would be accounted for and, if material, disclosed under U.S.\nGAAP); Crowe; Dow; and Nutrien (noting that it would be operationally possible to track specific costs\nincurred to mitigate transition risks or costs incurred due to severe weather events and natural conditions).\n771\n\ndisclosure is required.3094 Specifically, disclosure is required only if (1) the aggregate amount of\nexpenditures expensed as incurred and losses equals or exceeds one percent of the absolute value\nof income or loss before income tax expense or benefit; and/or (2) the aggregate amount of the\nabsolute value of capitalized costs and charges equals or exceeds one percent of the absolute\nvalue of stockholders\u2019 equity or deficit, subject to de minimis thresholds.3095 In addition, the\nfinal rules prescribe an attribution principle\u2014significant contributing factor\u2014in response to\ncommenters\u2019 concerns about their ability to isolate and attribute expenditures to severe weather\nevents and other natural conditions.3096\nThe final rules require registrants to disclose costs, expenditures, and losses incurred in\nconnection with the purchase and use of carbon offsets and RECs only if carbon offsets or RECs\nhave been used as a material component of a registrant\u2019s plans to achieve its disclosed climate-\nrelated targets or goals.3097 As explained above, this requirement is narrower than the proposed\nrules, which would have required registrants to disclose expenditures incurred to reduce GHG\nemissions or otherwise mitigate exposure to transition risks in the financial statements. Although\nregistrants will not be required to disclose expenditures generally related to transition activities\nin the financial statements, under the final rules, registrants are required to disclose material\nexpenditures incurred that directly result from: (1) disclosed activities to mitigate or adapt to\nclimate-related risk (in management\u2019s assessment); (2) disclosed transition plans; and (3)\n3094 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(b).\n3095 See id.\n3096 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(g). See also letter from NAM (\u201cCompanies would be required to count every single\nfinancial impact that could plausibly be attributable to climate risks, weather events, or transition activities,\nsomehow determine the degree of climate causation associated with each, and then aggregate these impacts\nto determine if they meet the proposed 1% threshold \u2013 for each line item in the consolidated financial\nstatements.\u201d).\n3097 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(e).\n772\n\ndisclosed targets and goals, as part of the final amendments to Regulation S-K. Since these\ndisclosure requirements are no longer part of the amendments to Regulation S-X, the disclosures\nwill fall outside the scope of the financial statement audit and a company\u2019s ICFR, which, along\nwith the materiality qualifier, should further reduce costs and burdens as compared to the\nproposed rules.3098\nIn addition, the final rules limit the scope of the requirement to disclose estimates and\nassumptions in the financial statements to only those estimates and assumptions materially\nimpacted by severe weather events and natural conditions and any climate-related targets or\ntransition plans disclosed by the registrant, whereas under the proposed rules, registrants would\nhave been required to disclose estimates and assumptions impacted by transition activities more\ngenerally.3099\nFinally, the final rules require the disclosure for historical fiscal year(s) only to the extent\nthe required information was previously disclosed or required to be disclosed (i.e., on a\nprospective basis).3100 Commenters stated that the proposed requirement to provide disclosure\nfor the historical fiscal year(s) included in the consolidated financial statements would be\nburdensome and costly because, among other things, it would require issuers to \u201cretroactively\nestimate their historical data.\u201d3101 However, under the final rules, no registrants will be required\nto provide disclosure for fiscal periods in which they were not required to collect or report the\ndata.\n3098 See 17 CFR 229.1502(d)(2), (e)(2) and 17 CFR 229.1504(c)(2).\n3099 See 17 CFR 210.14-02(h).\n3100 See 17 CFR 210.14-01(d).\n3101 See letter from BlackRock; see also letter from Autodesk (stating that \u201cit may be prohibitively costly\u201d for\nregistrants to accurately compile the necessary data, particularly for historical periods).\n773\n\nAfter taking into account the fact that the final rules eliminate many of the primary\ndrivers of the costs identified by commenters, and based on staff knowledge of accounting\npractices, we are using $500,000 as an estimated initial direct cost of compliance. While this\nrepresents a significant reduction from the median cost estimate provided by commenters, we\nview it as an upper bound estimate given the numerous changes from the proposal and the fact\nthat discrete expenditures of this type are already captured in the books and records and therefore\nshould be less costly to disclose.3102 Thus, we expect that in many cases, based on staff\nknowledge of accounting practices, costs will be significantly lower.\nAlthough we anticipate that the amendments to Regulation S-X we are adopting will be\nsignificantly less costly to apply than the proposed rules, registrants will incur some\nimplementation costs related to adjustments in processes and systems, including systems of\ninternal control. We expect these adjustments will be far fewer than would have been required\nunder the proposed rules.\nWith respect to the final amendments to Regulation S-X, registrants may need to adjust\ntheir internal processes and systems to (1) identify, track, and disclose the costs, expenditures,\ncharges, and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions and\nrelated to the purchase and use of carbon offsets and RECs; (2) calculate the disclosure\nthresholds; (3) identify and disclose the amount of relevant recoveries; (4) evaluate and disclose\nfinancial estimates and assumptions materially impacted by severe weather events and other\nnatural conditions or disclosed targets; and (5) to provide contextual information.\nTo calculate the upper bound of the range for ongoing costs, we used the estimates for the\ninitial and ongoing costs related to the proposed amendments to Regulation S-X provided by the\n3102 See supra note 3093.\n774\n\nChamber of Commerce to determine that the expected the ongoing costs would be approximately\n75% of the initial cost.3103 Applying that reduction to the upper bound of the Commission\u2019s\ninitial cost estimate of $500,000 results in an estimated upper bound of $375,000 for compliance\nwith the amendments to Regulation S-X on an ongoing, annual basis.3104 As noted above, given\nthe feedback from commenters that our cost estimates in the proposed rules were too low, we\nhave considered the upper bound of the estimated range in evaluating the economic impact of the\nfinal rules. However, we acknowledge the precise amount of both the implementation costs and\nongoing costs will vary depending on a number of factors including the size and complexity of\nthe registrant (and its financial reporting systems), and the frequency in which the registrant is\nexposed to severe weather events and other natural conditions, among other factors.\nWe also consider incremental audit fees resulting from the final rules. To be clear, these\nincremental audit fees are separate from the fees associated with mandatory assurance over GHG\nemissions disclosure. In the Proposing Release, we estimated this incremental cost to be $15,000\nwith respect to the proposed rules.3105 Several commenters asserted that actual costs would be\nmuch higher.3106 One commenter estimated incremental audit fees of $70,000 to $225,000 per\nyear.3107 Based on the final rules\u2019 significant reductions in the burden of complying with the\namendments to Regulation S-X, we expect a corresponding reduction in the cost of the audit. As\n3103 The initial range provided by the Chamber of Commerce was $1.5-$2.5 million while the ongoing estimate\nwas $1 million - $2 million. To arrive at 75%, we take the midpoint of the two ranges ($1.5 million\nongoing cost to $2 million initial cost).\n3104 This figure is based on the $500,000 estimate for initial implementation costs multiplied by 75%. See id.\n3105 See Proposing Release, section IV.C.2.a.\n3106 See, e.g., letters from Nutrien; Soc. Corp. Gov (June 17, 2022); National Association of Manufacturers;\nEdison Electric Institute; ConocoPhillips; Business Roundtable; Association of American Railroads; Ernst\n& Young LLP; and ABA.\n3107 See letter from Nutrien.\n775\n\na result, we are using an upper bound cost estimate of $23,000 in incremental audit fees per year\n(rounded to the nearest $1,000).\nc. Factors that Influence Direct Costs\nIncremental compliance costs may be relatively lower for registrants that already disclose\nany of the information required by the final rules. For instance, covered registrants that already\ndisclose Scope 1 and 2 emissions will face lower incremental costs relative to those that have\nnever previously disclosed such information, all else equal. As discussed in section A.5.a, the\nCommission staff found that 41 percent of annual reports on Form 10-K and Form 20-F filed in\n2022 contained some degree of climate-related disclosures. To the extent that these disclosures\nmeet some of the final rules\u2019 requirements, these registrants would face lower incremental costs.\nSome industry reports also document how a sizeable portion of U.S. companies report\nclimate-related information under one or more third-party frameworks that are either fully or\npartially aligned with the TCFD disclosure elements. Registrants with operations in foreign\njurisdictions3108 that have disclosure requirements based on the TCFD\u2019s framework for climate-\nrelated financial reporting may also face lower incremental costs.3109 To the extent that the final\nrules overlap with the TCFD framework, we expect lower incremental compliance costs for\nregistrants that already provide most or all disclosures according to the TCFD or related\nframeworks, including the CDP, which has fully integrated the TCFD disclosure elements into\n3108 Morningstar reports that over 35% of S&P 500 revenues came from foreign markets, while this percentage\nis around 20% for the revenues coming from companies belonging to the Russell 2000 index.

As discussed in section\nIV.A.3, a large subset of insurance companies must, by state law, disclose their climate-related\nrisk assessment and strategy via the NAIC Climate Risk Disclosure Survey. For example, a\ncomment letter by a state insurance commissioner stated that because this survey overlaps\nextensively with the TCFD recommendations, these companies should be able to easily switch\nfrom their current reporting to reporting via the TCFD framework,3110 and accordingly, similar\nportions of the final rules.\nWe reiterate that not all quantifiable cost estimates will be applicable to all registrants.\nFor instance, the final rules will not require SRCs and EGCs to incur costs of assessing their\nGHG emissions or obtaining the associated assurance. Other registrants may not have to provide\ncertain disclosures due to materiality qualifiers. Risk management disclosure, for example, will\nonly be required with respect to climate risks that are material. Other disclosures that may not\napply to all registrants include scenario analysis and targets and goals. The final rules do not\nrequire any registrants to undertake such activities, but if registrants voluntarily do so, the related\ndisclosures (and costs) would only be required following a materiality determination. As a\nresult, while certain registrants may incur some costs in order to make the prerequisite\nmateriality determination, those that subsequently deem a disclosure component to be non-\nmaterial would accordingly avoid the remaining portions of the estimated compliance costs\n3110 See letter from Mike Kreidler, Office of the Insurance Commissioner, State of Washington (June 14, 2021).\n777\n\nassociated with the disclosure (e.g., drafting, vetting and review, other reporting costs, and\nassurance in cases where Scope 1 and 2 emissions are not material).\nWith regard to California state laws on climate-related disclosure, registrants that will be\nrequired to comply with the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act and the Climate-Related\nFinancial Risk Act may experience reduced costs of compliance with the final rules to the extent\nthe California laws impose similar requirements for those registrants that are subject to them.\nSeveral commenters asserted that the recently enacted California laws, which reach some of the\nsame entities and require some of the same types of disclosure as these final rules, could affect\nthe benefits and costs of the final rules.3111 Another commenter stated that the Commission\ncould not rely on the California laws to reduce cost estimates because, based on the compliance\ndates in the Proposing Release, the final rules would precede the California laws in\nimplementation.3112 We disagree with that comment, in that enacted laws\u2014even if not fully\nimplemented\u2014imply future costs and benefits, and so we appropriately consider existing enacted\nlaws as part of the baseline against which we consider the economic effects of the final rules.3113\nHowever, our estimates of the final rules\u2019 direct compliance costs do not reflect any adjustments\nwith respect to the California laws because, as discussed below, the details of their\nimplementation are uncertain.\nWe expect that entities subject to the California laws could have lower incremental\ninformation gathering costs with respect to the final rules to the extent that there is overlap in the\ninformation that is required to be collected and reported under the final rules and the California\n3111 See, e.g., letters from Amer. for Fin. Reform, Public Citizen and Sierra Club (Oct. 26, 2023); Institute for\nPolicy Integrity et. al; and Rep. Maxine Waters.\n3112 Letter from Chamber II.\n3113 See SEC Guidance on Economic Analysis (2012), supra note 2574 (describing the baseline as \u201cthe best\nassessment of how the world would look in the absence of the proposed action\u201d).\n778\n\nlaws. For example, because both the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act and the final\nrules require companies to collect information to disclose their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions\nand \u201cobtain an assurance engagement of the disclosure,\u201d to the extent that the information and\nreporting activities overlap, registrants subject to the final rules and the Climate Corporate Data\nAccountability Act may face lower incremental information gathering compliance costs.3114\nHowever, the extent and overall impact of overlapping disclosure obligations are unclear.3115\nThe scope and requirements of the California laws differ from the final rules, such that\ncompliance with the final rules could require information collection and reporting activities in\naddition to those performed to satisfy the California requirements.3116 Additionally, one of the\nCalifornia laws allows the covered entity to satisfy certain California disclosure requirements\nwith a disclosure prepared pursuant to another law or regulation.3117 Therefore, while the\nCalifornia requirements may mitigate the costs of the final rules for some registrants, the degree\nof mitigation will depend on the regulations ultimately adopted and on the ways in which entities\norganize their compliance activities to satisfy reporting obligations in different jurisdictions.\n3114 One commenter agreed that compliance with the California laws could reduce the cost of compliance with\nthe final rules, stating that \u201c\u2026the costs of compliance with other provisions of the proposed rule will be\nreduced substantially due to overlap with California\u2019s new laws.\u201d Letter from Amer. for Fin. Reform.\nPublic Citizen and Sierra Club (Oct. 26, 2023).\n3115 For example, the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act directs a state agency to adopt implementing\nregulations by January 1, 2025 for reporting to begin in 2026. The details of those regulations are not yet\navailable.\n3116 One commenter identified two differences in scope between the California laws and the proposed rules: (1)\nthe Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act requires GHG emission disclosures \u201cbased on different\norganizational boundaries\u201d than the proposed rules; and (2) Climate Related Financial Risk Act requires\nbiennial reporting, instead of annual reporting. See letter from Chamber II. This commenter also stated\nthere could be additional administrative costs related to coordinating compliance with different reporting\nregimes. Id. We agree that differences such as these reduce the potential for cost mitigation through\noverlapping requirements (although we note that, in a change from the proposal, the final rules allow the\norganizational boundaries to differ from those used in the financial statements; see supra note 1034 and\naccompanying text).\n3117 See Climate Related Financial Risk Act, adding section 38533(b)(1)(A).\n779\n\nOne commenter suggested that the California laws could increase compliance costs by\nincreasing demand, and thus the cost, for external consultants and services.3118 We acknowledge\nthis could occur in the short term; however, over the long-term, we expect that increased demand\nwould cause new providers to enter the market, resulting in a corresponding increase in supply.\nAn increase in the supply of providers would lead to greater competition among the external\nconsultants, resulting in lower fees charged by consultants. To that end, the phased\nimplementation of the final rules should mitigate most costs stemming from any shortage of\nconsultants.\nRegistrants that have more exposure to material climate-related risks may face higher\ncompliance costs to the extent that they must provide more extensive disclosures. However, we\nnote that industries in which climate-risks are most likely to be material are also those that are\nalready providing some degree of voluntary or mandatory disclosures.3119\nThe incremental costs of the financial statement disclosures may be somewhat higher for\ncompanies with exposure to severe weather events or other natural conditions that are difficult to\nassess, track, and disclose in the financial statements. For example, companies (e.g., banks) with\ncomplicated asset structures or with operations in many jurisdictions may incur more costs to\nidentify the expenditures for which a severe weather event or other natural condition was a\n\u201csignificant contributing factor.\u201d\nIncremental costs, either proportionally or in dollar terms, may be higher for smaller\nregistrants, such as SRCs and EGCs, considering that they are less likely to have climate-related\n3118 See letter from Chamber II; see also supra note 3125 and accompanying text.\n3119 See section IV.A.5.a.\n780\n\ndisclosure systems and processes already in place.3120 If smaller firms were to face higher\nproportional fixed costs in meeting the disclosure requirements, they may potentially be placed at\na competitive disadvantage relative to larger firms.3121 Conversely, incremental costs may be\nlower for smaller firms to the extent that their assets and operations are less complex, which may\nallow them to prepare responsive disclosures at lower cost. We recognize that a portion of the\nfinal rules\u2019 compliance costs is \u201cfixed\u201d in the sense that the costs do not scale with registrant size\nor its level of resources. We therefore expect that smaller registrants will have more difficulty\nallocating resources to comply with the final rules as compared to larger firms.3122 To mitigate\nthese compliance burdens, the final rules provide SRCs and EGCs certain accommodations,\nincluding being exempt from the GHG emissions disclosure requirement and the accompanying\nassurance requirement, as well as an extended phased in compliance period, which will allow\nsuch issuers both more time to prepare for initial compliance, as well as the benefit of observing\nmarket practices prior to preparing their initial disclosures required in response to the final rules.\nWe expect compliance costs to decrease over time. For example, a registrant disclosing\nclimate-related information for the first time is likely to incur initial fixed costs to develop and\nimplement the necessary processes and controls.3123 Once the company invests in the\n3120 Commission staff\u2019s analysis of registrants\u2019 annual filings indicate that SRCs and EGCs are less likely to\nhave climate-related disclosures (as indicated by the presence of climate-related keywords) within their\nfilings (see section IV.A.5.a); see also section IV.A.5.b.ii for another Commission staff analysis that finds\nthat SRCs and EGCs are less likely to disclose GHG emissions.\n3121 See, e.g., letters from Chamber and NAM.\n3122 See, e.g., letter from CrowdCheck Law (\u201cFor example, for two companies we have worked with that\nrecently became Exchange Act reporting companies, the estimated costs for the first year of compliance\nwith the proposed rules would represent approximately 18.5% and 15%, respectively, of their entire gross\nrevenues for the year prior to becoming a reporting company.\u201d); see also letter from Independent\nCommunity Bankers (stating that \u201cthe compliance cost burden for the smallest community banks is double\nthat of the largest community banks\u201d).\n3123 See letter from Financial Executives International\u2019s (\u201cFEI\u201d) Committee on Corporate Reporting (\u201cCCR\u201d)\n(June 10, 2021); see also Proposing Release section IV.C.4.c.\n781\n\ninstitutional knowledge and systems to prepare the disclosures, the procedural efficiency of these\nprocesses and controls should subsequently improve, leading to lower costs in subsequent years.\nMandated climate disclosures may heighten demand for third-party services related to\npreparing the required disclosures, especially if registrants\u2019 current service providers cannot\nprovide the specific services that registrants may seek to comply with the final rules.3124 In the\nshort term, there could be a potential increase in the prices of such services, leading to higher\ncompliance costs. In the long term, however, this heightened demand is expected to spur\ncompetition, innovation, and economies of scale that could over time lower associated costs for\nsuch services and improve their availability.3125 Moreover, the aggregate accumulation of\ninstitutional knowledge may lead to a broad convergence of disclosure-related best practices,\nwhich could further reduce the costs of the required disclosures.\nOverall, the market effects deriving from competition and innovation could enhance the\nefficiency and availability of relevant services, thereby lowering compliance costs. These\npositive externalities from standard reporting practices can provide additional market-wide cost\nsavings to the extent that they reduce duplicative effort in the production and acquisition of\ninformation.3126\nD. Other Economic Effects\nThe analysis of benefits and costs in section IV.C is generally based on the assumption\nthat the final rules will not cause registrants to change how they manage climate-related risks,\nbut rather how they produce the associated disclosures. In this section, we consider the\n3124 See supra note 1372 and accompanying text in section II.I.2.c.\n3125 See also supra notes 2873, 3118 and accompanying text.\n3126 See Christensen et al. (2021).\n782\n\npossibility that the rules may influence how some companies approach climate-related risks. For\nexample, if agency conflicts currently prompt some managers to ignore long-run climate-related\nrisks, in an effort to increase short-term cash flows, the additional transparency provided by the\nfinal rules may lead managers to focus more on long-run considerations if that is what their\nshareholders demand. Conversely, if some managers currently are over-prioritizing climate-\nrelated risks as compared to what investors view as optimal, the final rules may lead those\nmanagers to scale back their level of investment in managing climate-related risks. Generally,\nwe expect that any resulting changes in behavior will primarily stem from investors\u2019 improved\nability to assess managerial decisions. That is, to the extent the final rules prompt managers to\nalter their approach to climate-related risks, it may be because they expect that failing to do so\nmight prompt a negative stock price reaction to the disclosures.3127\nRegistrants may change their behavior in response to the proposed disclosure\nrequirements by managing exposures to certain physical or transition risks. For example,\nempirical evidence shows that mandatory reporting of GHG emissions results in reduced\naggregate reported emissions among affected firms.3128 The final rules will require the\ndisclosure of the location of company properties or operations subject to material physical risks\n(Item 1502(a)(1)), which could allow investors to better assess companies\u2019 exposures to such\nrisks. It is possible that, in response to or anticipation of investor reactions, companies may\nrelocate properties or operations to geographical areas less exposed to physical risks or give\n3127 See M.

Krueger, supra note 2775.\n783\n\npreference to such areas for future business activity. Any such changes to registrant behavior\nresulting from the final rules may come with the potential cost of lower productivity,\nprofitability, or market share.3129 In the case of relocation, for example, the alternate location\nmay be more costly to operate. Similarly, we also recognize that some of the costs associated\nwith the final rules may prompt some registrants to abandon or forgo adoption of material targets\nor goals relating to GHG emissions. To avoid direct costs of compliance or to simply report a\nlower emissions amount in their required disclosures, some registrants may take steps to\nreorganize their business in order to shift certain parts of their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions\ninto the Scope 3 emissions category.3130 This potential response from registrants obscures the\nregistrants\u2019 true risk exposure and therefore could diminish the benefits of the disclosure related\nto investors\u2019 ability to assess exposure to climate-related transition risks.\nSome commenters asserted that the compliance costs of the rules might cause some\nregistrants to reduce their voluntary oversight of climate-related risks. For example, according to\none commenter, devoting \u201cresources to meeting the requirements of any final rules the\nCommission adopts\u2026 will detract from other climate-related reporting efforts.\u201d3131 This\ncommenter also asserted that the proposed requirement to \u201cdisclose internal information, such as\ninternal carbon pricing, scenario planning, and related information if a company has an emission\nreduction target, could discourage companies from setting such targets.\u201d3132 We recognize that\n3129 At the same time, we recognize that a registrant may optimize for both climate risks and productivity, as\nthese factors are not necessarily mutually exclusive.\n3130 See Lucas Mahieux, Haresh Sapra & Gaoqing Zhang, Climate-Related Disclosures: What Are the\nEconomic Trade-Offs? (Dec. 1, 2023), available at\nhttps://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4507526 (retrieved from SSRN Elsevier database).\n3131 See letter from API.\n3132 Id.\n784\n\nsome companies may pursue such avoidance strategies in response to the final rules. Other\ncompanies, however, may find the existence of disclosure requirements around climate-related\ntargets and goals to be beneficial for signaling credible value-enhancing commitments to\ninvestors and hence may be motivated to engage in setting targets.3133 More reliable and\nstandardized disclosures about climate-related targets and goals will facilitate investors\u2019\nunderstanding of the impact of those targets and goals, and hence could affect registrants\u2019\nincentives for making such commitments, but the magnitude and direction of any such effects\nwould depend upon registrants\u2019 decisions and investors\u2019 assessments about the value of those\ncommitments rather than stemming directly from the final rules.\nE. Effects on Efficiency, Competition, and Capital Formation\n1. Efficiency\nThe final rules should have positive effects on market efficiency. As discussed above,\nthe final rules should improve the informativeness and reliability of climate-related risks and\nfinancial disclosures. As a result of the disclosures required by the final rules, investors and\nother market participants should better understand the climate-related risks that registrants are\nfacing, their potential impact (e.g., on future cash flows), and registrants\u2019 ability to respond to\nand manage such risks. Investors and other market participants should thereby better evaluate\nregistrants and make more informed investment and voting decisions. As a result, the required\ndisclosures should reduce information asymmetry and mispricing in the market, improving\n3133 Disclosures filed with the Commission are subject to greater liability and thus may be viewed as more\ncredible than similar disclosures provided via other avenues (e.g., company sustainability reports). In\naddition, the final rules will require disclosure of details or specifics that some registrants may otherwise\nnot provide in the absence of the final rules.\n785\n\nmarket efficiency. More efficient prices should improve capital formation by increasing overall\npublic trust in markets, leading to greater investor participation and market liquidity.3134\nCurrently, investors may seek information on registrant\u2019s climate-related risks from\nvarious sources, including those outside of Commission filings. For example, the necessary\ninformation may only be available from company websites or from third-party service providers\nthat collect information and offer their analysis for a fee. Once investors locate relevant\ndisclosures, they may need to spend time organizing and compiling information in ways that\nfacilitate comparisons across companies. Because the final rules will make the required\ndisclosures available from a consistent source (i.e., Commission filings) and because the\ndisclosures will be standardized and tagged, we expect the final rules to improve efficiency by\nreducing the costs associated with compiling and organizing information on climate-related risks\nand oversight.3135\nWe expect the climate-related disclosures mandated by the final rules will cause\ndifferential asset price and financing cost responses across companies and settings, as investors\nare more easily able to factor this information into their valuation decisions. These expected\n3134 See Grewal, et al., supra note 2653; M.E.

Econ. 118 (2019).\n3135 One commenter stated that \u201c[t]he Commission offers no support for the view that a rule aimed at\nconsistency should be a stand-alone goal that will promote competition, efficiency, and capital formation.\u201d\nSee Overdahl exhibit to letter from Chamber. To the extent that the commenter is asserting that the\nconsistency achieved by the final rules does not promote or is somehow at odds with competition,\nefficiency, and capital formation, we disagree for the reasons outlined in this paragraph. Moreover, the\nCommission considers benefits and costs of the final rules in addition to the economic effects associated\nwith efficiency, competition, and capital formation. See SEC Guidance on Economic Analysis (2012),\nsupra note 2574.\n786\n\nimprovements in market efficiency are broadly consistent with empirical research. For example,\none academic study finds evidence that, among companies that voluntarily report emissions via\nthe CDP questionnaire, those with higher emissions (relative to their size and industry peers) pay\nhigher loan spreads.3136 Another study examined more than 16,000 companies from 2016\nthrough 2020 and found that investors were actively and directly pricing some transition risk into\nvaluations, an action that resulted in a negative correlation between companies\u2019 CO emissions\n2\nand their price-to-earnings ratio.3137\nEmpirical research has also documented evidence of current market inefficiencies with\nrespect to climate-related risks. For example, one study found that stock prices of food\nprocessing and agricultural companies may exhibit mispricing with respect to drought\nexposure.3138 The study documented that drought-exposed companies report reduced future\nprofitability, indicating that drought exposure is a financial risk.3139 In an efficient market, this\nrisk should result in trading activity that decreases the current stock price and increases the\nexpected return (to compensate investors for bearing this risk). The study, however, found that\ndrought-exposed companies deliver lower future returns relative to companies with less\nexposure, suggesting that the market initially under-reacts to drought exposure.3140 In other\n3136 See S. Kleimeier & M. Viehs, supra note 3134.\n3137 See Lazard Climate Center, Inaugural Research Findings of the Lazard Climate Center (Dec. 2021),\navailable at https://www.lazard.com/research-insights/inaugural-research-findings-of-the-lazard-climate-\ncenter/; see also https://lazard.com/media/ge5oromo/lazard-climate-center-presentation-december-2021.pdf\n(presentation). The Lazard presentation notes, however, that the effects vary significantly across different\ntypes of GHG emissions, market capitalization, and sectors. Large capitalization companies (>$50 billion)\nexperience greater valuation discounts, while larger emitters, such as energy companies, showed the most\nconsistently negative correlation. On average, a 10% decrease in a large U.S. energy company\u2019s emissions\ncorresponded with a 3.9% increase in its price-to-earnings ratio.\n3138 See H. Hong, et al., supra note 2739.\n3139 See id.\n3140 See id.\n787\n\nwords, the market fails to sufficiently incorporate the risk of drought exposure into the current\nstock price, resulting in investors holding mispriced assets and bearing risk for which they are\nnot appropriately compensated. Consistent with this finding, survey responses from institutional\ninvestors indicated that such investors believed that equity valuations do not fully reflect climate-\nrelated risks.3141 The final rules may help address these market inefficiencies by eliciting more\nconsistent and reliable information about climate-related risks so that those risks can be better\nincorporated into asset prices.\nWe also expect the final rules to increase efficiency by improving comparability of\nclimate-related disclosures and requiring them to be filed in a machine-readable data language\n(i.e., Inline XBRL).3142 As discussed in section IV.C.2.i, efficiency gains from standardized\nreporting practices can provide market-wide cost savings to registrants in the long-term, to the\nextent that they reduce duplicative effort in registrants\u2019 production and acquisition of information\n(e.g., certain data or third-party services related to preparing the required disclosures, including\nthe reporting of emissions data, may become cheaper in the long run as heightened demand spurs\ncompetition, innovation, and economies of scale). Finally, more standardized reporting should\nalso reduce investors\u2019 costs of acquiring and processing climate-related information by\nfacilitating investors\u2019 analysis of a registrant\u2019s disclosure and assessing its management of\nclimate-related risks against those of its competitors.\nThe inclusion of climate-related information in Commission filings using a machine-\nreadable data language (i.e., Inline XBRL), rather than external reports or company websites,\n3141 See Krueger, et al., supra note 2790.\n3142 See letters from Impact Capital Managers (indicating that the Inline XBRL requirement will contribute\ntoward the goal of eliciting more consistent, comparable, and reliable disclosure); and Climate Advisers\n(stating that tagging the new disclosures in Inline XBRL should, by allowing the disclosed information to\nbe more readily incorporated into investors\u2019 analyses, promote the efficiency of the U.S. capital markets).\n788\n\nshould also make it easier for investors to find and compare this information. In that regard,\nXBRL requirements have been observed to reduce the informational advantages of informed\ntraders and lead to lower cost of capital and higher stock liquidity for filers that provide tagged\ndisclosures.3143\nWe acknowledge commenters who stated that proposed amendments could decrease\nefficiency by reducing the incentives for reporting companies to develop business strategies,\ntransition plans, or goals, because the amendments would require disclosure of these strategies,\nplans or goals.3144 According to these commenters, the benefits of developing these elements\ncould be outweighed by the direct and indirect costs of disclosing them. While this may occur in\nsome circumstances, the efficiency loss is expected to be relatively low as the required\ndisclosures are not highly granular. Thus, in many cases, we believe the benefits of developing\nbusiness strategies, transition plans or goals will exceed the costs of such disclosure. But we\nrecognize that, more generally, the final rules may divert some resources away from what their\nbest use would otherwise be. As explained above, by removing some of the more prescriptive\nelements of the proposed rules that could require disclosure of a registrant\u2019s competitively\nsensitive information, the final rules mitigate this concern.\n3143 See, e.g., N. Bhattacharya, Y.J. Cho & J.B. Kim, Leveling the Playing Field Between Large and Small\nInstitutions: Evidence from the SEC\u2019s XBRL Mandate, 93 Acct. Rev. 51 (2018); B. Li, Z. Liu, W. Qiang &\nB.

Huang, XBRL Adoption and Cost of Debt, Int\u2019l.\nJ. of Acct. & Info. Mgmt. (2015); Cong et al., supra note 2948.\n3144 See, e.g., letter from Cato Inst.; Overdahl exhibit to letter from Chamber; and Motor & Equipment\nManufacturers Association.\n789\n\nSome commenters raised the more general concern that final rules could divert managers\u2019\nattention from other types of risks that may be more urgent or important to investors. 3145\nHowever, we expect this channel will be somewhat limited. First, the final rules will elicit more\ndisclosures from those registrants for which climate-related risks have materially impacted or are\nreasonably likely to have material impacts on the registrants\u2019 financials or business strategy.\nTherefore, the final rules are unlikely to demand significant managerial attention in settings in\nwhich such attention is not warranted. Second, managers and directors have strong incentives to\nmaximize the market value of the company (as reflected in the stock price). As a result, there is\nlimited upside to selecting policies that prioritize climate over other concerns that investors view\nas more important determinants of company value.\n2. Competition\nOverall, we expect that by standardizing reporting practices, the final rules would level\nthe playing field among firms, making it easier for investors to assess the climate-related risks of\na registrant against those of its competitors. The effects of peer benchmarking can contribute to\nincreased competition for companies in search for capital both across and within industries,\nwhereby registrants can be more easily assessed and compared by investors against alternative\noptions.\nSome commenters raised concerns that the proposed rules would have increased\ncompetition among registrants for hiring individuals with climate-related expertise and/or GHG\nemissions attestation providers.3146 These commenters asserted that the proposed rules could\nincrease the costs of hiring key personnel with relevant experience, which could restrain a\n3145 See, e.g., letters from Chamber; Southside Bancshares; and BIO.\n3146 See, e.g., discussions in sections II.E.2.b and II.I.5.b.\n790\n\nregistrant\u2019s ability to produce climate disclosures and institute climate-related strategies.3147\nWhile the final rules do not completely eliminate concerns about the costs of hiring or engaging\nthose with climate-related expertise, we have made several changes to mitigate these costs. With\nrespect to GHG emissions assurance, for example, the final rules will permit assurance providers\nto use the ISO 14064-3 attestation standard, which should limit the circumstances in which\nregistrants need to seek out different attestation engagements. In addition, the extended phase in\nperiods for compliance with the GHG emissions disclosure and assurance requirements will\nprovide additional time for registrants to seek out, and the markets to respond to increased\ndemand for, climate-related professional services.\nSome commenters stated that the proposed amendments would harm the competitive\nposition of Commission registrants relative to their peers who do not face such disclosure\nrequirements.3148 In particular, these commenters stated that Commission registrants would face\ndirect costs of compliance, and indirect costs such as the risk of disclosure of proprietary\nbusiness information, while other companies would not face these costs.3149 Relative to the\nproposed rules, the final rules take a number of steps to reduce the costs of complying with the\nfinal rules.3150 For example, we have eliminated the requirement to disclose Scope 3 emissions,\nwe have significantly narrowed the Regulation S-X requirements, and the final rules for subpart\n1500 of Regulation S-K include additional materiality qualifiers and less prescriptive disclosure\nrequirements. Moreover, as discussed above, a number of these changes from the proposal will\n3147 See, e.g., letter from Can. Bankers\n3148 See letters from API; Matthew Winden; and Southside Bancshares, Inc.\n3149 Id.\n3150 See section IV.C.2.\n791\n\nserve to limit the circumstances in which disclosure of potentially competitive business\ninformation will be required.\nSimilarly, one commenter noted that public companies could be placed at a competitive\ndisadvantage when bidding to acquire a private target company because they would need to\nscreen prospective targets for their ability to produce the disclosures required by the proposed\nrules.3151 Any such competitive disadvantage will be mitigated under the final rules, as\ncompared to the proposed rules, because we no longer are applying disclosure requirements to a\nprivate company that is a party to a business combination transaction, as defined by Securities\nAct Rule 165(f), involving securities offerings registered on Form S-4 or F-4.\nCommenters also raised concerns about disproportionate effects for smaller companies,\nas discussed above in section IV.C.3.c. Any costs that disproportionately impact smaller\ncompanies\u2014such as those that do not scale with the size of the registrant\u2014may limit the ability\nof smaller registrants to compete with larger registrants. As discussed above, the final rules do\nnot require SRCs and EGCs to provide GHG emissions disclosures and provide SRCs and EGCs\nwith longer phase in periods to delay implementation costs. This delay may effectively lower\nimplementation costs for SRCs and EGCs to the extent that, by the time they are required to\nreport, SRCs and EGCs can look to the disclosure practices developed by other registrants to\nassist them in preparing their own disclosures.\n3151 Letter from Shearman Sterling. See also supra 2461 and accompanying text.\n792\n\n3. Capital Formation\nMore consistent, comparable, and reliable disclosures could lead to capital market\nbenefits in the form of improved liquidity and lower costs of capital.3152 These benefits would\nstem from reductions in information asymmetries brought about by the required disclosure of\nclimate-related information.3153 The reduction in information asymmetry between managers and\ninvestors could allow investors to better estimate future cash flows, which could reduce\ninvestors\u2019 uncertainty, thus lowering the costs of capital.3154 In addition, less information\nasymmetry among investors could mitigate adverse selection problems by reducing the\ninformational advantage of investors that have sufficient resources to become more informed\nabout a registrant\u2019s exposure to and management of climate-related risks.3155 This is likely to\n3152 See D.W. Diamond & R.E. Verrecchia, Disclosure, Liquidity, and the Cost of Capital, 46 J. Fin. 1325\n(1991) (finding that revealing public information to reduce information asymmetry can reduce a company\u2019s\ncost of capital through increased liquidity); see also C. Leuz & R.E. Verrecchia, The Economic\nConsequences of Increased Disclosure, 38 J. Acct. Res. 91 (2000). Several studies provide both theoretical\nand empirical evidence of the link between information asymmetry and cost of capital. See, e.g., T.E.\nCopeland & D. Galai, Information Effects on the Bid\u2010Ask Spread, 38 J. Fin. 1457 (1983) (proposing a\ntheory of information effects on the bid-ask spread); Easley et al., supra note 2753 (showing that\ndifferences in the composition of information between public and private information affect the cost of\ncapital, with investors demanding a higher return to hold stocks with greater private information.).\n3153 See, e.g., Christensen et al. (2021), at 1147 (noting \u201c[A] primary benefit of corporate disclosure is to\nmitigate information asymmetries between the firm and its investors as well as among investors . . . [T]he\ngeneral takeaway from this large literature is that more and better disclosure can lead to tangible capital-\nmarket benefits in the form of improved liquidity, lower cost of capital, higher asset prices (or firm value),\nand potentially better corporate decisions . . . To the extent that mandatory CSR reporting and CSR\nstandards improve the information available to investors, the same theories and many of the prior findings\nshould apply when considering the economic effects of the mandate or standard.\u201d).\n3154 See Diamond et al., supra note 3152; Lambert, et al., Accounting Information, supra note 2753;\nChristopher Armstrong, John Core, Daniel Taylor & Robert Verrecchia, When Does Information\nAsymmetry Affect the Cost of Capital?, 49 J. of Acct. Rsch. 1 (2011). We note that these articles also detail\nlimited theoretical circumstances under which more reliable disclosures could lead to a higher cost of\ncapital, such as in the case where improved disclosure is sufficient to reduce incentives for market making.\n3155 See Verrecchia, et al., supra note 2748.\n793\n\nimprove stock liquidity (i.e., narrower bid-ask spreads), which could attract more investors and\nreduce the cost of capital overall.3156\nThere are two additional channels through which the disclosures could impact cost of\ncapital. The first arises because some investors may have preferences to invest with companies\nthat are more or less exposed to climate-related risks about which the final rules will elicit\ndisclosure. To the extent the disclosures provide more complete and reliable information about a\nregistrant\u2019s material climate-risks and how such risks are being managed, shifts in investor\ndemand for the registrant\u2019s securities could increase or decrease (depending on investor\npreferences and how they factor this information into their investment decision-making).3157 The\n3156 One commenter asserted that this first channel does not apply to corporate disclosures, as it pertains only to\nbid-ask spreads set by market makers concerned with trading against parties with more information about\norder flow. See Overdahl exhibit to letter from Chamber. We disagree. Market makers concerned about\ntrading against more informed parties will set larger bid-ask spreads regardless of the reason for the\nasymmetric information. In this setting, corporate disclosures of material climate-related information\nwould reduce information asymmetries between market makers and other traders who have, for example,\nlearned about a company\u2019s climate related risks through proprietary research. See letters from Calvert\n(\u201cCalvert purchases third party vendor data to support our ability to assess companies on their ESG factors\nand that provide specific data related to climate change, where available. Often vendor information is\nestimated when a company has not disclosed information on its climate-related risks. Sometimes the\nestimates are made across industries, based on what other more proactive peers have disclosed.\u201d); Boston\nTrust Walden (reporting: \u201cour analysts examine quantitative and qualitative climate-related corporate\ndisclosure to enhance our understanding of the existing and potential financial outcomes associated,\nranging from risks (e.g., losing the license to operate) to opportunities (e.g., generating new sources of\nrevenue)\u201d). We also note that corporate disclosures of material climate-related information reduce\ninformation asymmetries between affiliated investors and other investors. See also Glosten et al., supra\nnote 2748, for evidence that informed traders may take advantage of \u201cprivate information or superior\nanalysis\u201d when making investment decisions). This commenter also asserted that the Commission must\nconsider the potential efficiency losses that may result from investors no longer having the same incentives\nto invest in this type of proprietary research. We disagree with the commenter that there would be an\nefficiency loss. The primary benefit of proprietary research is more accurate prices. If disclosures obviate\nthe need for proprietary research by achieving price discovery in the absence of that research, there is not\nan efficiency loss from the lack of research. This commenter also argues that voluntary disclosure regimes\nshould enable corporate issuers to lower their cost of capital by reducing information asymmetry. See\nsupra note 3154. We discuss shortcomings related to a voluntary disclosure regime in this context in\nsection IV.B.2, and we cite to academic evidence in supra notes 2748 and 3153 that mandatory reporting\nthat improves the information available to investors can lead to tangible capital market benefits.\n3157 See Yang, supra note 2827; Avramov, Cheng, Lioui & Tarelli, Sustainable Investing with ESG Rating\nUncertainty, 145 J. of Fin. Econ. (Oct. 2022); L. Pastor, R. Stambaugh & L. Taylor, Sustainable Investing\nin Equilibrium, 142 J. Fin. Econ. 550 (2021); P. Bolton & M. Kacperczyk, supra note 2744; Li et al., supra\nnote 2657.\n794\n\nsecond results from the fact that some aspects of climate risk may not be diversifiable and\ntherefore could command a risk premium. Academic research suggests that investors demand a\nhigher return to hold assets that are more exposed to non-diversifiable climate-related risk\n(including both transition and physical risks).3158 If the disclosures cause investors to update\ntheir expectations of a registrant\u2019s exposure to this type of risk, the cost of capital could adjust\naccordingly.\nMore generally, if compliance costs with the final rules are sufficiently high, this could\ninfluence the marginal company\u2019s decision to exit public markets or refrain from going public in\nthe first place to avoid having to comply with the disclosure requirements. This concern was\nechoed by a number of commenters.3159 Companies may choose this strategy if they believe the\npotential compliance costs from the final rules outweigh the benefits of being a registered public\ncompany including, for example, a more liquid market for the company\u2019s securities and the\nassociated reduction in cost of capital. Uptake of this avoidance strategy may widen the\ntransparency gap between public and private companies, negatively affecting capital markets\u2019\ninformation efficiency, and potentially reducing the size of the public markets.3160 However, we\nnote that this avoidance strategy will come with significant disadvantages. For example, any\ncompanies deterred from registration because of the final rules would face more limited access to\n3158 See, e.g., Bolton et al., supra note 3157 (finding that investors demand compensation for exposure to\ncarbon emissions risk); Acharya et al., supra note 2905 (finding higher expected returns for exposure to\nphysical risks); Huynh & Xia (2021).\n3159 See letters from Elaine Henry; API; Cunningham et al.; Matthew Winden; Southside Bancshares Inc.;\nDavid Burton; AEPC; CCMR; Chamber; Petrol. OK; and AGs of Cal. et al.\n3160 See Overdahl exhibit to letter from Chamber.\n795\n\nthe capital markets, implying higher financing costs and debt-ratios.3161 On balance, we believe\nthe benefits of being a public registered company are sufficiently strong such that it is unlikely\nmany companies will choose to avoid becoming or continuing as a public registered company as\na result of the final rules. In this regard, we note that the final rules include a number of changes\nfrom the proposal intended to mitigate the compliance burden on registrants and lessen\ndisproportionate impacts on smaller and emerging growth firms.\nF. Reasonable Alternatives\n1. Adopt a more (or less) principles-based approach to Regulation S-K disclosures\nMany commenters recommended a more principles-based approach (either overall or\nwith respect to specific provisions) that would permit registrants to determine the type of\nclimate-related information to disclose based on what they deem to be appropriate.3162 Such an\napproach might reduce reporting costs because registrants would be required to report only\ninformation that they determine to be appropriate given their unique circumstances. To the\nextent that the more prescriptive elements of the final rules result in disclosure that is less useful\nfor investors, a principles-based approach could benefit investors by reducing the incidence of\nless material or even boilerplate disclosure.3163 A principles-based approach would also reduce\nthe risk that the disclosure requirements could lead registrants to change their risk management\n3161 See Omer Brav, Access to Capital, Capital Structure, and the Funding of the Firm, 64 J. of Fin. 263 (2009);\nAnthony Saunders & Sascha Steffen, The Costs of Being Private: Evidence from the Loan Market, 24 Rev.\nof Fin. Stud. 4091 (2011); E.P. Gilj & J.P Taillard, Do Private Firms Invest Differently than Public Firms?\nTaking Cues from the Natural Gas Industry, 71 J. of Fin. 1733 (2016).\n3162 See, e.g., letters from Beller, et al. and Microsoft; Sullivan Cromwell; Airlines for America; BOA;\nBusiness Roundtable; Soc. Corp. Gov; and Overdahl exhibit to letter from Chamber.\n3163 Similarly, one commenter described \u201c1) the ability of a principles-based approach to evolve in order to\nkeep pace with emerging issues; and 2) the flexibility of a principles-based approach to correct deficiencies\nor excesses in disclosure without the need for the Commission to continuously add to or update the\nunderlying disclosure rules as new issues arise.\u201d Overdahl exhibit to letter from Chamber. We\nacknowledge that a principles-based approach can present these benefits and that prescriptive rules may\nneed updates.\n796\n\nstrategies in ways that are less than optimal for the sake of achieving what they perceive to be\nmore favorable climate-related disclosure.\nOn the other hand, a more principles-based approach would not fully achieve many of the\nintended benefits of the rules, which are focused on enhancing the consistency and comparability\nof existing voluntary disclosure arrangements. In addition, a principles-based approach could\nincrease shareholder confusion because the choice of climate metrics and other details (e.g., time\nhorizon) may vary significantly across registrants. Also, a principles-based approach may allow\nregistrants to selectively choose the measures or time horizon that result in the most favorable\ndisclosures. In the final rules, we elected to include prescriptive disclosure requirements (with\ncertain modifications to address commenter concerns) to avoid such cherry-picking of\ninformation and to ensure that investors are provided with more consistent and comparable\ninformation about climate-related risks.\nWe similarly considered whether the final rules should be more prescriptive. This would\ngenerally improve investors\u2019 ability to compare disclosures across registrants since disclosures\nwould be less tailored to each registrant\u2019s specific circumstances. A more prescriptive approach\nwould also reduce the risk of boilerplate disclosures. However, we decided against this approach\nin light of commenters\u2019 concerns about the costs of compliance with the proposed rules, as well\nas the importance of allowing registrants the flexibility to provide investors with the most useful\nand relevant disclosures. Accordingly, in response to commenters, the final rules include\nadditional materiality qualifiers and take a less prescriptive approach in a number of areas, which\nshould help to mitigate some of the concerns expressed with respect to the proposed rules while\ncontinuing to elicit more decision-useful information for investors about climate-related risks.\n797\n\n2. Different approaches to assurance over GHG emissions disclosures\nWe considered several alternative approaches to assurance over GHG emissions\ndisclosure. For example, the Commission could not require that any GHG emissions disclosure\nbe subject to assurance. Alternatively, the Commission could require reasonable assurance of all\nGHG emissions disclosures rather than only for LAFs. The Commission could also prescribe\nmore restrictive requirements for attestation standards and assurance providers. Inherent in these\nchoices is a tradeoff between compliance costs and the reliability of the disclosures. For\nexample, while requiring reasonable assurance for all GHG emissions would have likely resulted\nin more reliable disclosures, it would have imposed considerable costs on registrants, based on\nfeedback from commenters about the costs of obtaining reasonable assurance.3164\nWe also considered taking a less prescriptive approach to the independence requirements\nfor assurance providers in the final rules. For example, we considered not adopting a\nrequirement for the GHG emissions assurance provider to be independent with respect to the\nregistrant and any of its affiliates and/or instead requiring disclosure about any potentially\nindependence-impairing relationship.3165 This approach would help to mitigate concerns\ncommenters raised about a potential shortage of qualified GHG emissions assurance providers\nincreasing the costs for registrants3166 and potential burdens on registrants related to the need to\nassess the independence of assurance providers.3167 However, not imposing an independence\nrequirement or only requiring disclosure about potential conflicts would not provide the same\n3164 See, e.g., letter from Salesforce (estimating that obtaining reasonable assurance rather than limited\nassurance over their emissions disclosures would increase their expected costs by $1-$3 million).\n3165 See 17 CFR 229.1506(b)(2).\n3166 See, e.g., letters from AEPC; Climate Risk Consortia; and Soc. Corp. Gov.\n3167 See, e.g., letter from Soc. Corp. Gov.\n798\n\nconfidence to investors that the attestation provider will perform the engagement in an objective\nand impartial manner. This in turn would diminish one of the key benefits of requiring assurance\nover GHG emissions disclosures, which is to improve the reliability of such disclosures.\nWe acknowledge that the independence requirement in the final rules may result in some\nregistrants that are already obtaining assurance voluntarily needing to retain a new GHG\nemissions assurance provider that meets the independence requirement or may make it more\ndifficult for a registrant that has not obtained GHG assurance before to find an available\nprovider. These costs are mitigated by the modifications in the final rules that provide registrants\nsubject to the assurance requirement with a multi-year phase in period before they are required to\nobtain an attestation report. The phase in period will give registrants time to find a provider that\nmeets the independence requirement or provide existing service providers time to unwind any\nexisting conflicts in order to meet the independence requirement. It will also give non-\naccountant attestation providers time to familiarize themselves with the independence\nrequirement and adapt their business practices accordingly.\n3. Different thresholds for financial statement disclosures\nWe considered alternative criteria for disclosure under the amendments to Regulation S-\nX, such as using a more principles-based materiality approach. In general, materiality thresholds\ncan help ensure that the disclosure elicited is most likely to factor into an investor\u2019s decision or\nvoting decisions. While materiality is used as the threshold for disclosures in certain contexts,\nwe believe that registrants will benefit from the certainty associated with a set of bright line\nquantitative thresholds. In doing so, investors will have disclosures that are more consistent\nacross registrants due to the predictable application of quantitative thresholds. As discussed\nabove, we have significantly modified the scope of the proposed disclosures and threshold and\n799\n\nhave included de minimis exceptions to focus the requirements on providing material disclosure\nto investors. However, we decided not to eliminate the bright-line thresholds entirely and move\nto a more principles-based disclosure standard because the quantitative disclosure threshold\nprovides registrants with greater clarity in implementing the rules, reduces the risk of\nunderreporting, and increases consistency and comparability. This approach is consistent with\nthe feedback we received from some commenters that expressed concerns about the risks of\nunderreporting in the context of the financial statements, as evidenced by the limited climate-\nrelated disclosure under current accounting standards despite increasing demand by investors for\nsuch disclosure.\nWe considered not including de minimis disclosure thresholds. A de minimis threshold is\nmore likely to be triggered for smaller registrants; so, not including a de minimis threshold\nwould have resulted in similar rates of disclosure from both large and small companies.\nHowever, this approach would have been more likely to elicit disclosures that are not decision-\nuseful to investors. In particular, for some registrants, shareholders\u2019 equity and income or losses\nbefore taxes may not scale meaningfully with the magnitude of the registrant\u2019s operations, for\nexample, if the registrant is highly leveraged or was not very profitable (or very unprofitable)\nduring the period. Including de minimis thresholds will avoid triggering overly granular\ndisclosure in such anomalous situations.\nFollowing feedback from commenters, we also considered limiting the new Regulation S-\nX disclosures to registrants in certain sectors. While restricting disclosure to specific sectors\nwould limit the costs of disclosure, it would result in a lack of information about other sectors,\nwhich can be affected by severe weather events or other natural conditions. By specifying\ndisclosures for certain sectors, the Commission would also risk making a determination about\n800\n\nwhich sectors to include and exclude that may become obsolete in the future if conditions\nchange. For sectors that are not generally affected by severe weather events or other natural\nconditions, the costs associated with these disclosures are likely to be moot.\n4. Permit disclosures to be furnished rather than filed\nWe considered the possibility of permitting some or all of the required disclosures to be\nfurnished rather than filed. Although some commenters expressed a desire for furnished\ndisclosures, stating that it would lower the legal liability for registrants who are required to\nprovide climate-related disclosures under the final rules,3168 furnished disclosures may also limit\nthe benefit for investors who rely on complete and accurate information from registrants about\ntheir climate-related risks and their efforts to address these risks.3169 By contrast, requiring\nregistrants to file, rather than furnish, the climate-related disclosures provided pursuant to the\nfinal rules will give investors the ability to bring suit if registrants fail to comply with the new\ndisclosure requirements, for instance under Exchange Act section 18.3170 This will improve the\navenues of redress available to investors in the case of false or misleading statements with\nrespect to material facts and, in turn, provide benefits to investors to the extent they rely on the\ndisclosures required under the final rules to make investment or voting decisions. Further,\ntreating these disclosures as filed will help promote their accuracy and consistency to the extent\nregistrants seek to avoid liability (under, for example, section 18) by taking additional care to\nensure that disclosures are accurate. We believe, therefore, that information about climate-\n3168 See, e.g., letter from CCMR; see also section II.K.2.\n3169 See discussion in II.K.3.\n3170 Climate-related disclosures provided pursuant to the final rules also will be subject to section 11 liability if\nincluded in, or incorporated by reference into, a Securities Act registration statement.\n801\n\nrelated risks should be subject to the same liability as other important business or financial\ninformation that the registrant includes in its registration statements and periodic reports.\nWe acknowledge that requiring these disclosures to be filed may increase registrants\u2019\nlitigation risks (and, therefore, their costs of complying with the final rules) relative to an\nalternative approach that would allow registrants to furnish the disclosures. The modifications\nwe have made to the proposed rules, however, should help to mitigate those concerns. These\nmodifications include: limiting the scope of the GHG emissions disclosure requirement;3171\nrevising several provisions regarding the impacts of climate-related risks on strategy, targets and\ngoals, and financial statement effects so that registrants will be required to provide the\ndisclosures only in certain circumstances, such as when material to the registrant;3172 and\nadopting a provision stating that disclosures (other than historic facts) provided pursuant to\ncertain of the new subpart 1500 provisions of Regulation S-K constitute \u201cforward-looking\nstatements\u201d for the purposes of the PSLRA safe harbors.3173 We also are providing registrants\nwith a phase in period based on filer status to give them additional time to prepare to provide the\nclimate-related disclosures, which will constrain registrants resources less over the short run,\nwhich could effectively lower implementation costs.3174\nFinally, regardless of whether the information is filed or furnished, registrants may be\nsubject to potential liability under Securities Act section 17(a), Exchange Act section 10(b),\nand/or Rule 10b-5, as applicable, for false or misleading material statements in the information\ndisclosed pursuant to the final rules.\n3171 See supra section II.H.3.\n3172 See supra sections II.D.3, II.G.3, and II.H.3.\n3173 See supra section II.J.3.\n3174 See supra section II.O.3.\n802\n\n5. Exempt SRCs/EGCs\nWe considered completely exempting SRCs and EGCs from the final rules. While such a\nbroad exemption would avoid burdening newly public and/or smaller registrants with the costs of\nthe final rules, which include some fixed costs that would disproportionately affect smaller\nregistrants, such an alternative would leave significant gaps in the information set on climate-\nrelated risks faced by registrants, thereby significantly detracting from comparability and other\ninformational benefits of the final rules. We have, however, made a number of changes from the\nproposal, such as generally reducing the prescriptiveness of the proposed rules, which should\nhelp to mitigate the compliance burden for all registrants, including SRCs and EGCs. We are\nalso providing phase in periods based on filer status, which will provide registrants that are SRCs\nor EGCs with additional time to prepare to make disclosure under the final rules.\nFor emissions-related disclosures, there exists a similar trade-off between costs and\nbenefits of exempting SRCs and EGCs. However, based in part on the analysis performed by\nCommission staff, which indicated extremely low rates of disclosure for SRCs and EGCs, we\nhave exempted SRCs and EGCs from the requirement to disclose GHG emissions data given the\nsignificant compliance burden that such disclosure could impose on smaller registrants.3175\n6. Permit registrants to rely on home-country disclosure frameworks / substituted\ncompliance\nIn light of the fact that several other jurisdictions have adopted or are currently pursuing\nclimate-related disclosure frameworks, some commenters suggested that that the Commission\nconsider allowing registrants to comply with the proposed rules by using disclosures provided in\n3175 See section II.L.3 and supra note 946 and accompanying text.\n803\n\nthese other jurisdictions.3176 While this substituted compliance approach has the potential to\nreduce costs to the extent that there are overlapping disclosure requirements, we have\ndetermined, at this time, that it is premature to allow for substituted compliance with the final\nrules, given the current status of such requirements in other jurisdictions. Accordingly, the\nCommission intends to observe how reporting under international climate-related reporting\nrequirements and practices develop before making any determination whether such an approach\nwould result in consistent, reliable, and comparable information for investors. As noted\nabove,3177 the Commission may consider such accommodations in the future depending on\ndevelopments in the international climate reporting practices and our experience with disclosures\nunder the final rules.3178\nSimilarly, some commenters suggested that, in lieu of the proposed GHG emissions\ndisclosure requirements, we should require registrants to submit GHG emissions data that they\npublicly report under other regulatory regimes, such as the GHGRP.3179 Under such an\napproach, registrants would not need to track and report GHG emissions data that they are not\nalready collecting for other regulatory purposes, and thus registrants would not incur certain\ndirect compliance costs associated with disclosing this information under the final rules\n(although they would assume new securities law liability for including the information in\nCommission filings). However, as discussed in detail in section IV.C.2.e, reporting under other\nregulatory regimes, such as the GHGRP, serves different purposes than disclosure under the\n3176 See letters from AllianceBernstein; Davis Polk; Linklaters L; PGIM; PwC; and SAP SE.\n3177 See supra section II.L.3.\n3178 See, e.g., section IV.A. discussing the domestic and international disclosure requirements that are still being\ndeveloped and finalized at this time.\n3179 See letter from Grundfest; Memorandum of Meeting with Grundfest and Wilson (June 28, 2023).\n804\n\nFederal securities laws, and the information reported is not always presented in ways that are\ndecision-useful for investors. Accordingly, we have decided not to adopt such an alternative.\n7. Alternative tagging requirements\nWith respect to Inline XBRL tagging, we considered changing the scope of disclosures\nrequired to be tagged, for example by removing the tagging requirements for climate-related\ndisclosures for all or a subset of registrants (such as SRCs). As another example, we considered\nrequiring only a subset of proposed climate-related disclosures, such as the quantitative climate-\nrelated disclosures, to be tagged in Inline XBRL. Narrowing the scope of climate-related\ndisclosures to be tagged could have provided some incremental cost savings for registrants\ncompared to the final rules, because incrementally less time would have been required to select\nand review the particular tags to apply to the climate-related disclosures.\nHowever, we believe any such incremental cost savings would have been low because all\naffected registrants are required to tag certain of their disclosures (including both quantitative\nand qualitative disclosures) in Inline XBRL.3180 Moreover, narrowing the scope of tagging\nrequirements would have diminished the extent of informational benefits that would accrue to\ninvestors by reducing the volume of climate-related information that would become less costly to\nprocess and easier to compare across time and registrants. For example, an alternative whereby\nonly quantitative climate-related disclosures would be tagged would have inhibited investors\nfrom efficiently extracting or searching climate-related disclosures about registrants\u2019\ngovernance; strategy, business model, and outlook; risk management; and targets and goals, thus\ncreating the need to manually run searches for these disclosures through entire documents. Such\nan alternative would also have inhibited the automatic comparison and redlining of these\n3180 See supra section IV.c.2.ix.\n805"

PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT\nA. Summary of the Collections of Information\nCertain provisions of our rules and forms that will be affected by the final rules contain\n\u201ccollection of information\u201d requirements within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of\n1995 (\u201cPRA\u201d).3181 The Commission published a notice requesting comment on changes to these\ncollections of information in the Proposing Release and submitted these requirements to the\nOffice of Management and Budget (\u201cOMB\u201d) for review in accordance with the PRA.3182 The\nhours and costs associated with preparing and filing the forms and reports constitute reporting\nand cost burdens imposed by each collection of information.3183 An agency may not conduct or\nsponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information requirement\nunless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. Compliance with the information\ncollections is mandatory. Responses to the information collections are not kept confidential and\nthere is no mandatory retention period for the information disclosed. The titles for the affected\ncollections of information are:\n\u2022 Form S-1 (OMB Control No. 3235-0065);\n\u2022 Form F-1 (OMB Control No. 3235-0258);\n3181 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.\n3182 44 U.S.C. 3507(d) and 5 CFR 1320.11.\n3183 The paperwork burdens for Regulation S-X, Regulation S-K, Regulation C, and Regulation S-T are\nimposed through the forms, schedules, and reports that are subject to the requirements in these regulations\nand are reflected in the analysis of those documents.\n806\n\n\u2022 Form S-4 (OMB Control No. 3235-0324);\n\u2022 Form F-4 (OMB Control No. 3235-0325);\n\u2022 Form S-11 (OMB Control No. 3235-0067);\n\u2022 Form 10 (OMB Control No. 3235-0064);\n\u2022 Form 20-F (OMB Control No. 3235-0288); and\n\u2022 Form 10-K (OMB Control No. 3235-0063).\nThe final rules will require registrants filing Securities Act registration statements on\nForms S-1, F-1, S-4, F-4, and S-11 to include the climate-related disclosures required under\nsubpart 1500 of Regulation S-K and Article 14 of Regulation S-X. The final rules will further\nrequire registrants filing Exchange Act annual reports on Forms 10-K and 20-F and Exchange\nAct registration statements on Forms 10 and 20-F to include the climate-related disclosures\nrequired under subpart 1500 of Regulation S-K and Article 14 of Regulation S-X. Registrants\nmay include the climate-related disclosures required under subpart 1500 in a part of the\nregistration statement or annual report that is separately captioned as Climate-Related Disclosure\nor in another appropriate section, such as Risk Factors, MD&A, or Description of Business.\nRegistrants will be required to include the climate-related disclosures required under Article 14\nin a note to the financial statements.\nIn addition, if a registrant is an LAF or AF that is not an SRC or EGC, the final rules may\nrequire the registrant to disclose its Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions. Such registrant will also\nbe required to file an attestation report in connection with its Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions\ndisclosure. For purposes of Exchange Act reporting on domestic forms, although a U.S.\nregistrant may incorporate by reference such disclosure from its Form 10-Q for the second fiscal\nquarter in the fiscal year immediately following the year to which the GHG emissions metrics\n807\n\ndisclosure relates, we have attributed the paperwork burden associated with the GHG emissions\ndisclosure requirement and the related attestation report to the Form 10-K annual report. This is\nbecause the GHG emissions disclosure and related attestation report are requirements of, and\nrelate to the same fiscal year-end as, the Form 10-K.\nA description of the final rules including the need for the climate-related information and\nits intended use, as well as a description of the likely respondents, can be found in section II\nabove, and a discussion of the economic effects of the final rules can be found in section IV\nabove.\nB. Current Inventory Update to Reflect $600 Per Hour Rather than $400 Per Hour\nOutside Professional Costs Rate\nAt the outset, we note that the current OMB inventory for the above-referenced\ncollections of information reflect an average hourly rate of $400 per burden hour borne by\noutside professionals. Similarly, in the Proposing Release, the Commission used an estimated\ncost of $400 per hour, recognizing that the costs of retaining outside professionals may vary\ndepending on the nature of the professional services.3184 The Commission recently determined\nto increase the estimated costs of such hourly rate to $600 per hour3185 to adjust the estimate for\ninflation from Aug. 2006.3186 In order to more accurately present the burden changes as a result\nof the final rules in the context of the current burden inventory, we are presenting updated\nnumbers for the current inventory for professional cost burden for each of the affected\n3184 See Proposing Release, section V.C.\n3185 We recognize that the costs of retaining outside professionals may vary depending on the nature of the\nprofessional services, but for purposes of this PRA analysis, we estimate that such costs would be an\naverage of $600 per hour.\n3186 See Listing Standards for Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation, Rel.

Summary of Comment Letters\nIn the Proposing Release, the Commission requested comment on the PRA burden hour\nand cost estimates and the analysis used to derive the estimates.3188 While a number of parties\ncommented on the potential costs of the proposed rules, only a few commenters mentioned the\nPRA analysis.3189 One commenter stated that it opposed the rule proposal in part because, in its\n3187 The table uses the percentage estimates we typically use for the burden allocation for each response. See\ninfra PRA Table 2.\n3188 See Proposing Release at section V.D.\n3189 See letters from D. Burton, Heritage Fdn; Institute for Energy Research (June 17, 2022) (\u201cIER\u201d); and\nGregory Lau (June 16, 2022) (\u201cG. Lau\u201d).\n809\n\nview, it would \u201cmore than doubl[e] the total paper-work compliance costs to public\ncorporations.\u201d3190 Two commenters stated that the Commission had underestimated the\ncompliance burden and costs of the proposed rules.3191 One of the commenters stated that\n\u201cbesides failing to monetize the internal compliance burden hours, the PRA Table ignores: 1.\nlitigation costs; 2. cost not easily and directly allocable to filling out the forms listed in [the PRA\nTable]; 3. costs imposed on non-issuers; and 4. [t]he cost to investors, issuers and workers\ncaused by adverse economic effects of the rule.\u201d3192\nWhile we acknowledge the commenters\u2019 concerns about costs of the proposal, for the\nreasons discussed in section II and elsewhere throughout this release, we believe the information\nrequired by the final rules is necessary and appropriate in the public interest and for the\nprotection of investors. Further, a discussion of the economic effects of the final rules, including\nconsideration of comments that expressed concern about the expected costs associated with the\nproposed rules, can be found in section IV above. With regard to the calculation of paperwork\nburdens, we note that both the Proposing Release\u2019s PRA analysis and our PRA analysis of the\nfinal rules estimate the incremental burden of each new or revised disclosure requirement\nindividually and fully comport with the requirements of the PRA. We further note that the costs\nthat one commenter stated we had not included are not costs that are required to be considered or\ntypically included in a PRA analysis.3193 Further, our estimates reflect the modifications to the\nproposed rules that we are adopting in response to commenter concerns, including streamlining\n3190 See letter from IER.\n3191 See letters from D. Burton, Heritage Fdn.; and G. Lau.\n3192 D. Burton, Heritage Fdn.\n3193 See id.\n810\n\nsome of the proposed rule\u2019s elements to address concerns regarding the level of detail required\nand the anticipated costs of compliance.\nD. Sources of Cost Estimates\nWe based the paperwork burden of the proposed rules in part on the BEIS impact\nassessment for the UK climate disclosure rules as well as the input from commenters to a request\nfor public input.3194 Our estimates of the paperwork burden associated with the final rules are\nbased on the direct cost estimates discussed in the Economic Analysis.3195 As discussed above in\nmore detail in section IV.C.3.b, those direct cost estimates are based primarily on two cost\nestimates for similar UK climate disclosure rules (i.e., the 2021 BEIS impact assessment and the\n2021 FCA cost-benefit analysis)3196 and on cost estimates provided by several commenters.3197\nWhile we believe that the direct cost estimates provide a reasonable means of determining the\nestimated collection of information burden associated with the final rules, they likely represent\nan upper bound of the paperwork burden of the final rules as they reflect a conservative approach\n(i.e., erring on the side of overstating costs rather than understating them) to estimate\napproximate compliance costs for the final rules.\nE. Incremental and Aggregate Burden and Cost Estimates of the Final Rules\nBelow we estimate the incremental and aggregate increase in paperwork burden resulting\nfrom the final rules. These estimates represent an average multi-year burden for all issuers, both\nlarge and small. While we typically calculate a three-year average for PRA purposes, because\n3194 See Proposing Release, section V.B.\n3195 See supra section IV.C.3.\n3196 See FCA, Enhancing climate-related disclosures by standard listed companies and seeking views on ESG\ntopics in capital markets, CP21-18 (June 2021), available at\nhttps://www.fca.org.uk/publication/consultation/cp21-18.pdf; and BEIS Final Stage Impact Assessment.\n3197 See supra section IV.C.3.b.\n811\n\none of the amendment\u2019s requirements will not be phased in until the ninth year of initially\nproviding the disclosures required by the amendments,3198 we have estimated a nine-year\naverage PRA burden. In deriving our estimates, we recognize that the burdens will likely vary\namong individual registrants based on a number of factors, including the nature of their business,\nthe size and complexity of their operations, and whether they are subject to similar climate-\nrelated disclosure requirements in other jurisdictions or already preparing similar disclosures on\na voluntary basis. For purposes of the PRA, the burden is to be allocated between internal\nburden hours and outside professional costs.\nPRA Table 2 below sets forth the percentage estimates we typically use for the burden\nallocation for each affected collection of information.\nPRA Table 2. Standard Estimated Burden Allocation for Specified Collections of\nInformation\nCollection of Information Internal Outside Professionals\nForms S-1, F-1, S-4, F-4, S-11, 10, and 20-F 25% 75%\nForm 10-K 75% 25%\n1. Calculation of the Paperwork Burden Estimates of the Final Rules\nWhen estimating the paperwork burden of the proposed rules, we considered the effects\nof three sets of climate-related information that would be required to be filed on the\nCommission\u2019s forms under those rules: climate-related disclosures regarding governance,\nstrategy, and risk management; GHG emissions metrics and targets; and financial statement\nmetrics. When estimating the paperwork burden of the final rules, we have modified the sets of\n3198 See supra sections II.I and O (regarding the requirement for LAFs to obtain a reasonable assurance\nattestation report in fiscal 2033 when the initial compliance date for most other disclosures required by\nLAFs is in fiscal year 2026).\n812\n\ninformation considered to reflect changes made from the proposed rules. First, we have\nseparated disclosures related to targets from disclosures related to metrics. Second, we have\nreplaced \u201cfinancial statement metrics\u201d with \u201cfinancial statement disclosures.\u201d This modification\nreflects the fact that the final rules do not use the term \u201cmetrics\u201d to describe the amendments to\nRegulation S-X because it is more accurate to characterize the disclosures as financial statement\neffects.3199\nThe estimated burden hours and costs of the final rules are generally lower than the\nestimated burden hours and costs of the proposed rules. This is due to changes from the\nproposed rules that we are adopting in the final rules. For example, the final rules include\nmateriality qualifiers and other revisions in the disclosure categories regarding governance, risk\nmanagement, and strategy, including transition plans, scenario analysis, targets and goals, and\nGHG emissions metrics. In addition, we have revised the average salary rate from that used for\nthe proposed PRA estimates to convert some of commenters\u2019 cost estimates into burden hours,\nconsistent with existing OMB guidance.3200\n3199 See supra note 1705.\n3200 The PRA estimates for the proposed rules used an hourly rate that was based on an average annual salary of\na climate specialist, according to Glassdoor, but which did not reflect additional labor costs. See Proposing\nRelease, section V.B. We have based the PRA estimates for the Regulation S-K subpart 1500 disclosure\nrequirements on average salary rates according to SIFMA Management and Professional Salaries Data,\nwhich the staff has updated to account for inflation through September 2023 and which includes overall\ncosts and overhead associated with the reported professional and management positions. The SIFMA data\nprovides a more realistic cost basis for determining the PRA burdens associated with the final rules because\nof this additional information, and is consistent with OMB guidance that, when determining burden hours,\n\u201call wages need to be fully-loaded, meaning they reflect the full cost of labor.\u201d OMB, A Guide to the\nPaperwork Reduction Act, available at https://pra.digital.gov/burden/. In addition, unlike the PRA\nestimates for the proposed rules, which were based solely on the average annual salary of a climate\nspecialist, we have based the PRA burden hour estimates of the subpart 1500 rules on the median salary\nrates of in-house legal counsel and systems analyst/database administrators, whom we believe in\nconjunction with each other will most likely perform the work underlying the disclosures of governance,\nstrategy, risk management, targets and goals, and Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions metrics. We therefore\nhave taken the average of the median salary rates for SIFMA-listed attorney positions (Attorney and\nAssistant General Counsel, which average $525/hr.) and SIFMA-listed system analyst/database\n813\n\nThe following PRA Table 3 shows the estimated number of total burden hours resulting\nfrom the final rules based on the initial and ongoing cost estimates for the above-described sets\nof information as discussed in section IV above. To derive the estimated total number of burden\nhours, we first applied the appropriate percentage estimate from PRA Table 2 to allocate the\nportion of the cost estimate for each set of information pertaining to the internal burden and the\nportion pertaining to external professional costs. We then converted the costs to internal burden\nhours using a conversion rate of $441/hr. for governance, strategy, and risk management,\nscenario analysis, Scopes 1 and 2 emissions, targets and goals, and financial statement\ndisclosures.3201 We similarly converted external professional costs into burden hours using a\nconversion rate of $600/hr. We then added internal and external burden hours to obtain the total\nnumber of estimated burden hours for each set of information. All numbers have been rounded\nto the nearest whole number.\nadministrator positions (Systems Analyst, Sr. Systems Analyst, and Sr. Database Administrator, which\naverage $356/hr.) calculated as follows: $525/hr. + $356/hr. = $881/hr. $881/2 = $441/hr.\n3201 Id.\n814\n\nPRA Table 3.

The first two tables summarize, respectively, the estimated internal burden\nhour (PRA Table 4A) and external professional cost effects (PRA Table 4B) of the final rules.\nBoth tables show the phase in for the Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosure requirements. Both\nLAFs and non-exempt AFs are subject to the requirement to disclose their Scopes 1 and 2\nemissions if material. LAFs must comply with the GHG emissions disclosure requirement\nbeginning with their second fiscal year of compliance with the final rules, while non-exempt AFs\nmust comply beginning with their third fiscal year of compliance.3202\nThe tables span the first nine years of compliance in order to cover the first year of the\npaperwork burden associated with the requirement to obtain a reasonable assurance attestation\nreport, which LAFs must comply with in their ninth year of compliance. For comparability\npurposes, we have also estimated the paperwork burden effects for non-exempt AFs and SRCs,\nEGCs, and NAFs over a nine-year span, and have taken a nine-year average for each of the three\ngroups of registrants.3203\nAfter a three-year phased in compliance period of reporting their GHG emissions, both\nLAFs and non-exempt AFs will be required to obtain an attestation report to verify their GHG\n3202 The final rules provide a phase in for another set of information\u0336\u0336\u2012the material expenditures disclosure\nrequirement, which will be provided pursuant to either Item 1502, as part of a registrant\u2019s strategy\ndisclosure, or Item 1504 of Regulation S-K, as part of a registrant\u2019s targets and goals disclosure. All three\ngroups of registrants must comply with the material expenditures disclosure requirement in the fiscal year\nimmediately following the fiscal year of their initial compliance date for the final rules based on their filer\nstatus. As explained in section IV.C.3, we have assumed that costs for the material expenditures disclosure\nhave been included in the cost estimates considered for strategy or targets and goals disclosures. See supra\nnote 3060 and accompanying text. Because the material expenditures disclosure will comprise only part of\na registrant\u2019s strategy or targets and goals disclosure and because most of the disclosure requirements\npursuant to Item 1502 and Item 1504 are not subject to a phase in, the tables below do not account for the\nmaterial expenditures phase in.\n3203 In each table, all numbers have been rounded to the nearest whole number.\n816\n\nemissions disclosure. While LAFs will initially be required to obtain an attestation report at the\nlimited assurance level, after a four-year transition period, they will be required to obtain an\nattestation report at the reasonable assurance level. We estimate that a reasonable assurance\nattestation report will be more costly than a limited assurance report.

Estimated Number of Affected Respondents\nWe estimate that the final rules will change the paperwork burden per response for each\naffected collection of information. However, we do not believe that the above-described\npaperwork burdens will affect all the filers for each collection of information. Because the final\nrules include materiality qualifiers and otherwise will not require disclosure in all instances from\nall registrants, but rather depend on the registrant\u2019s particular facts and circumstances, we\nestimate that only a certain percentage of filers of each form will be required to provide the\nclimate-related disclosures. We have based the estimated percentages on third-party surveys of\ncurrent climate-related disclosure practices, commenters\u2019 estimates of companies likely to\ndisclose climate-related risks and metrics, and staff estimates of current climate-related\ndisclosure practices.3205\nThe following PRA Table 5 provides the percentage of filers for each collection of\ninformation that we estimate will be affected by the final rules.\n3205 In particular, we have considered the percentages of surveyed companies, both issuers with larger market\ncapitalization and all other registrants, providing climate-related disclosures as reported by the TCFD in\nTCFD, 2022 Status Report (Oct. 2022). That report included climate-related data from companies with a\nmarket capitalization ranging from greater than $12.2 billion to less than $3.4 billion. In addition, we have\nconsidered aspects of the third-party surveys discussed in section IV, such as the 2021 S&P Global\nCorporate Sustainability Assessment and estimates of climate-related risk and metrics reporting provided\nby commenters, such as Amer. for Fin. Reform and Public Citizen (Oct. 26, 2023). That commenter\nincluded climate-related data pertaining to Fortune 1000 companies with individual annual revenues over\n$2 billion. However, none of the estimates considered included companies that directly matched the\nregistrants that will be affected by the final rules. Therefore, the estimated percentages of LAFs, AFs, and\nall other registrants affected by the final rules, as provided in the table below, may underestimate or\noverestimate the actual number of affected respondents.\n821\n\nPRA Table 5.

As\ndiscussed in Section IV, the number of domestic registrants and foreign private issuers affected by the final rules is estimated as the number of companies that filed a unique Form 10-K or Form 20-F during calendar\nyear 2022, excluding asset-backed securities issuers. Of domestic respondents, approximately 33% were LAFs, 5% were non-exempt AFs, and 62% were all other registrants (SRCs, EGCs, and NAFs). Of foreign\nrespondents, approximately 33% were LAFs, 11% were non-exempt AFs, and 56% were all other registrants (SRCs, EGCs, and NAFs).\n2 All percentages for LAFs, non-exempt AFs, and all other registrants (SRCs, EGCs, and NAFs) rounded to nearest 5%.\n3 For example, according to the TCFD 2022 Status Report, an average of 48% of the largest companies provided disclosures related to governance, strategy, and risk management (excluding scenario analysis), 68% of\nLAFs provided some climate-related disclosures in Commission filings in 2022 as discussed in Section IV above, and 73% of Fortune 1000 companies will likely be required to disclose their climate risks and strategies\npursuant to recent California law, according to one commenter. See letter from Amer. for Fin. Reform, Public Citizen, and Sierra Club (Oct. 26, 2023). 48 + 68 + 73 = 189; 189/3 = 63, which we have rounded up to\n65%.\n823\n\n3.

    "text": "VI. FINAL REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ACT ANALYSIS\nThe Regulatory Flexibility Act (\u201cRFA\u201d) requires the Commission, in promulgating rules\nunder section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act,3206 to consider the impact of those rules\non small entities. We have prepared this Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (\u201cFRFA\u201d) in\naccordance with section 604 of the RFA.3207 An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis\n(\u201cIRFA\u201d) was prepared in accordance with the RFA and was included in the Proposing\nRelease.3208\nA. Need for, and Objectives of, the Final Amendments\nThe final amendments add a new subpart 1500 to Regulation S-K and a new Article 14 to\nRegulation S-X, which will require registrants to provide certain climate-related disclosures in\ntheir Securities Act and Exchange Act registration statements and Exchange Act reports. These\nrequirements will elicit more complete and useful information about the impacts of climate-\nrelated risks on registrants to improve the consistency, comparability, and reliability of climate-\nrelated information for investors. As required by the RFA, this FRFA describes the impact of the\nfinal amendments on small entities. The need for, and objectives of, the final rules are described\nin sections I and II above. We discuss the economic impact and potential alternatives to the\namendments in section IV, and the estimated compliance costs and burdens of the amendments\nfor purposes of the PRA in section V.\n3206 5 U.S.C. 553.\n3207 5 U.S.C. 604.\n3208 Proposing Release at section VI.\n828\n\nB. Significant Issues Raised by Public Comments\nIn the Proposing Release, the Commission requested comment on any aspect of the\nIRFA, and particularly on the number of small entities that would be affected by the proposed\namendments, the existence or nature of the potential impact of the proposed amendments on\nsmall entities discussed in the analysis, how the proposed amendments could further lower the\nburden on small entities, and how to quantify the impact of the proposed amendments.\nWe received one comment letter on the IRFA from the U.S. Small Business\nAdministration\u2019s Office of Advocacy (\u201cAdvocacy\u201d).3209 Advocacy\u2019s letter expressed concern\nthat \u201cthe IRFA does not adequately describe the regulated small entities and potential impacts on\nthose entities.\u201d3210 In the Proposing Release, the Commission estimated that the proposed\namendments would apply to 1,004 registrants that may be considered small entities.3211\nAdvocacy\u2019s comment letter stated that this estimate did \u201cnot provide additional information,\nsuch as the North American Industry Classification System (\u201cNAICS\u201d) classifications of the\naffected entities\u201d and did not \u201cbreak down the affected entities into smaller size groups (e.g.,\nbased on total assets).\u201d3212\nThe comment letter from Advocacy also addressed the discussion of alternatives within\nthe IRFA and the Commission\u2019s explanation of why it did not ultimately propose such\nalternatives. Advocacy also stated that \u201c[t]he RFA requires that an IRFA provide significant,\n3209 See letter from U.S. Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy (June 17, 2022) (\u201cAdvocacy\u201d).\nSome commenters, while not specifically addressing the IRFA, did address the impact of the proposed rules\non SRCs. See letters from Soc. Corp. Gov. (Nov. 11, 2022); BIO; FFAC; CCR; HDA; ICI; Jones Day;\nNACCO; NAHB; Rho Impact; CBD; Grant Eisenhofer; ICBA; and Williams Cos.\n3210 See letter from Advocacy.\n3211 Proposing Release at 16617.\n3212 See letter from Advocacy.\n829\n\nfeasible alternatives that accomplish an agency\u2019s objectives,\u201d and stated that the IRFA did not\nsatisfy this requirement because it listed \u201cbroad categories of potential alternatives to the\nproposed rules but [did] not analyze specific alternatives that w[ere] considered by the SEC\u201d and\nbecause it did not \u201ccontain a description of any additional regulatory alternatives which\naccomplish the SEC\u2019s stated objectives and which would further minimize the significant\neconomic impact of the proposal on small entities.\u201d3213 Finally, Advocacy stated that the\nCommission had not \u201cconsidered the impacts of the proposal to indirectly regulated small\nentities\u201d as a result of the proposed requirement for Scope 3 emissions data from certain\nregistrants.3214 Advocacy stated that \u201c[m]any of these upstream and downstream parties will be\nsmall, privately-owned companies that do not have public reporting requirements,\u201d and as result\nsuch \u201csmall businesses are unsure what information they would be expected to provide to public\ncompanies, how to collect the necessary information, and whether their businesses would be able\nto absorb the associated costs.\u201d3215\n1. Estimate of Affected Small Entities and Impact to Those Entities\nWith respect to the adequacy of the Proposing Release\u2019s estimate of affected small\nentities, the RFA requires \u201ca description of and, where feasible, an estimate of the number of\nsmall entities to which the proposed rule will apply.\u201d3216 Advocacy\u2019s published guidance\nrecommends agencies use NAICS classifications to help in \u201cidentifying the industry,\n3213 See id.\n3214 See id.\n3215 See id.\n3216 5 U.S.C. 603(b)(3).\n830\n\ngovernmental and nonprofit sectors they intend to regulate.\u201d3217 Here, given that the rulemaking\napplies to and impacts all public company registrants, regardless of industry or sector, we do not\nbelieve that further breakout of such registrants by industry classification is necessary or would\notherwise be helpful to such entities in understanding the impact of the proposed or final rules.\nIn this case, small entities in certain industries and sectors are not necessarily more affected than\nothers, as climate-related risks may exist across all industries and sectors, and may or may not\nexist for a particular registrant irrespective of the industry classification.3218 For the same\nreasons, we are not breaking down the affected entities into smaller size groups (e.g., based on\ntotal assets), as recommended by Advocacy. Given the nature of the final rules, we believe that\nour estimate below of the number of small entities to which the final rules will apply adequately\ndescribes and estimates the small entities that will be affected.3219\nWe disagree with the statement in Advocacy\u2019s comment letter that \u201cSEC expects that the\ncosts associated with the proposed amendments to be similar for large and small entities.\u201d The\nCommission explained in the IRFA that the proposed amendments would apply to small entities\nto the same extent as other entities, irrespective of size, and that therefore, the Commission\nexpected that \u201cthe nature of any benefits and costs associated with the proposed amendments to\nbe similar for large and small entities\u201d (emphasis added).3220 The analysis with respect to the\nnature of the costs (and benefits) of the proposed rules detailed in the Economic Analysis of the\n3217 U.S. Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy, A Guide for Government Agencies: How to\nComply with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Aug. 2017), at 18, available at\nhttps://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/advocacy/How-to-Comply-with-the-RFA-WEB.pdf.\n3218 A breakout would be relevant where, for example, the Commission finds that small entities generally would\nnot be affected by a rule but small entities in a particular industry would be affected.\n3219 See infra section VI.C.\n3220 Proposing Release at section VI.D.\n831\n\nProposing Release was referenced in the IRFA to help small entities understand such impacts,\nnot to imply that small entities face the same proportional costs as large entities. Indeed, the\nCommission went on to state in both the IRFA and the Economic Analysis of the Proposing\nRelease that costs \u201ccan vary significantly depending on firm characteristics, such as firm size,\nindustry, business model, the complexity of the firm\u2019s corporate structure, starting level of\ninternal expertise, etc.\u201d3221\nThe Commission solicited comments on the proposal\u2019s potential effect on small entities,\nand specifically acknowledged that their varied characteristics, including \u201cthe nature and conduct\nof their businesses make[s] it difficult to project the economic impact on small entities with\nprecision.\u201d3222 We note that the proposal, while not exempting small entities from the full scope\nof the proposed amendments, did exempt SRCs, which would generally include all estimated\nsmall entities that would be subject to the proposed rules, from the proposed Scope 3 emissions\ndisclosure requirements and from the proposed GHG attestation requirements. Under the\nproposal, SRCs also were afforded a longer transition period to comply with the proposed rules\nthan other registrants.\nWe nonetheless recognize the concerns raised by Advocacy and others regarding the costs\nto small entities subject to the proposed rules, as well as the concerns about the indirect impact to\nsmall entities not subject to the proposed rules. We discuss the economic effects, including\ncosts, of the final rules across all entities in section IV above. We recognize that, to the extent\nthe costs of the final rules are generally fixed across entities, they would be proportionally more\ncostly for smaller companies. However, as discussed both above and below, to help mitigate that\n3221 Id. at 21441.\n3222 Id. at 21463.\n832\n\nrelatively greater burden to smaller companies and to respond to commenter concerns, we have\nmade a number of changes in the final rules to ease these burdens, including providing SRCs,\nEGCs and NAFs with the longest phase in periods for compliance as well as excluding them\nentirely from some of the requirements, such as the GHG emissions disclosure and related\nassurance requirements. Additionally, certain changes from the proposal, including streamlining\nthe requirements, making them less prescriptive and adding materiality qualifiers, will reduce the\noverall burden of the final rules for all registrants, including small entities. Accordingly, we\nbelieve that both this FRFA and our prior IRFA adequately describe and analyze the relative\nimpact of costs to small entities.\n2. Consideration of Alternatives\nThe IRFA\u2019s discussion of significant alternatives, and our discussion of alternatives\nbelow, satisfy the RFA. The relevant RFA requirement provides that an IRFA \u201cshall also\ncontain a description of any significant alternatives to the proposed rule which accomplish the\nstated objectives of applicable statutes and which minimize any significant economic impact of\nthe proposed rule on small entities.\u201d3223 In the Proposing Release, the Commission discussed\neach of the types of significant alternatives noted in section 603 of the RFA and concluded that\nnone of these alternatives would accomplish the stated objectives of the rulemaking while\nminimizing any significant impact on small entities. In addition, section IV.F of the Proposing\nRelease discussed reasonable alternatives to the proposed rules and their economic impacts.\nSimilarly, in addition to the discussion in section VI.E below, in section IV.F of this release we\nalso discuss reasonable alternatives of the final rules and their economic impacts.\n3223 5 U.S.C. 603(c) (emphasis added).\n833\n\nWhile not commenting on the alternatives raised in the IRFA specifically, several\ncommenters asked the Commission to provide further exemptions not only for SRCs as\nproposed, but also for other small businesses without reporting obligations that may have faced\nupstream or downstream reporting obligations under the proposed rules.3224 One of these\ncommenters stated that while \u201cappreciat[ive] that the Commission proposes to exempt small\ncompanies from a portion of the reporting requirements (Scope 3)\u201d small companies in the\nbiotechnology industry \u201cwill be disproportionately affected by the proposed rule while providing\nlimited benefit to investors.\u201d3225 This commenter also asserted that the proposed exemptions\nwould not provide relief to smaller companies that \u201chave no product revenues but often fall\noutside of the scope of smaller reporting companies due to existing public float threshold.\u201d3226\nFailure to consider these companies, it argued, could lead to \u201cdiminishing incentives\u201d to go\npublic and potentially duplicative regulation.3227 Another commenter reiterated this concern,\nstating that Scope 3 emission requirements extend beyond registrants to privately owned entities,\nspecifically those without the resources to comply with the proposed disclosures.3228\nAdvocacy stated it was concerned about the potential upstream and downstream effects\nof Scope 3 emissions disclosure requirements on non-regulated small businesses.3229 Several\n3224 See SBCFAC Recommendation; Small Business Forum Recommendation (2023); and letters from OOIDA;\nNAHB; and NACS.\n3225 Letter from BIO. However, some commenters disputed this characterization. See letter from Amer. for Fin.\nReform, Sunrise Project et al., (stating that \u201c[o]ffering a wholesale exemption is unsupported by the\nextensive research, discussed throughout these comments, showing that climate-related financial risks are\nwidely dispersed throughout the economy and not limited to large registrants. In addition, given their\nsmaller size, SRCs are likely to have significantly less costs in assessing and disclosing Scope 3 emissions\nthan large registrants.\u201d).\n3226 See letter from BIO.\n3227 See id.\n3228 See letter from Independent Community Banks of North Dakota (July 14, 2022).\n3229 See letter from Advocacy.\n834\n\ncommenters raised similar concerns.3230 While small businesses without reporting requirements\nwere not obligated under the proposed rules to provide this information, several commenters\nexpressed concerns that companies with reporting obligations would compel the collection of\nthis information as a condition of doing business with these businesses.3231\nThe Commission also received comments that explicitly opposed a wholesale exemption\nfor smaller companies, pointing to the need for greater transparency about climate-related risks\nirrespective of a registrant\u2019s size.3232 Some of these commenters explained their opposition to a\nwholesale exemption by stating that smaller companies may face disproportionately greater\nclimate-related risks, and asserted that the additional proposed phase in period was adequate to\nensure smaller companies had time to comply with the proposed rules.3233\nAnother commenter stated that, with respect to the proposal to require disclosure about\nthe climate expertise of board members, small companies\u2019 \u201coperations and limited resources do\nnot naturally lend themselves to requiring discrete board expertise for every risk, including\nclimate-related risk.\u201d3234 This commenter also stated that requiring the disclosure of board\n3230 See letter from AFPA (\u201cThe SEC should carefully consider that the potential burdens of the proposal are\nnot limited to public companies subject to SEC regulation, as private companies, including innumerable\nsmall businesses, also are expected to face inquiries from many SEC-regulated customers as a result of the\nrules.\u201d).\n3231 See letter from Venture Dairy Cooperative (\u201cAlthough this proposed rule is likely well intended as a step to\nboth measure and monitor climate related information on publicly traded companies on Wall Street, this\nextension of reporting on Scope 3 emissions will inevitably filter down the supply chain to our nation\u2019s\nfamily farms who grow and raise the food we eat.\u201d).

Mgmt.; IASJ IEN; FFAC; Grant Eisenhofer; NCF; OMERA PWHC LLP; Prentiss; S. Lloyd;\nSweep; Terra Alpha; UNCA; and WAP.\n3233 See letter from ICI (\u201cIn addition, we support the Commission not proposing generally to exempt SRCs or\nEGCs from the entire scope of the proposed climate-related disclosure rules because climate-related risks\nmay pose a significant risk to the operations and financial condition of smaller companies. At the same\ntime, providing them with more time than other companies to comply with any new requirements could\nmitigate the Proposal\u2019s compliance burden for smaller companies by giving them additional time to\nallocate the resources necessary to compile and prepare climate-related disclosures.\u201d).\n3234 See letter from NRP.\n835\n\nexpertise for a smaller company could lead to the selection of board members without other\nrequisite skills.\nThe Commission considered the comments on the Proposing Release, including those\naddressing the impact of the proposed reporting obligations on small entities. The final rules\naddress several concerns raised by Advocacy and other commenters and modify the proposal in\nways that will significantly reduce costs to smaller reporting companies, including small entities\nthat meet the definition of SRCs, EGCs, and NAFs. For example, SRCs, EGCs and NAFs are\nnot subject to the requirement to disclose Scope 1 and 2 emissions, as discussed above.\nAdditionally, the Commission is not adopting the proposal to require disclosure of Scope 3\nemissions for any entities. This will address any concerns about the possible impacts of the\nproposed Scope 3 requirements on small entities, including private companies, in a reporting\ncompany\u2019s value chain. Additionally, as a result of eliminating the reference to negative\nclimate-related impacts on a registrant\u2019s value chain from the proposed definition of climate-\nrelated risks, the final rules further limit the burdens of climate risk assessment on parties in a\nregistrant\u2019s value chain that might have occurred under the rule proposal.\nWe agree with commenters that stated that smaller companies should not be fully\nexempted from the final rules because they could face material climate risks about which\ninvestors need information to make informed voting and investment decisions.3235 As with other\nsized entities, many of the changes we have made to streamline the rules and provide additional\nflexibility to registrants to tailor their disclosures based on their particular facts and\ncircumstances will similarly benefit smaller companies. For example, the changes made to the\ngovernance and risk management sections are less prescriptive and more principles-based, which\n3235 See, e.g., supra notes 2410-2413.\n836\n\nwill allow smaller companies to avoid disclosure requirements that are not compatible with their\nbusiness. Additionally, as discussed in section II.O, we are providing SRCs, EGCs, and NAFs\nwith significant additional time to comply with the final rules, with the earliest disclosures being\nrequired no sooner than the filings that are required to include financial information for fiscal\nyear 2027.\nC. Small Entities Subject to the Final Amendments\nThe final rules apply to registrants that are small entities. The RFA defines \u201csmall entity\u201d\nto mean \u201csmall business,\u201d \u201csmall organization,\u201d or \u201csmall governmental jurisdiction.\u201d3236 For\npurposes of the RFA, under our rules, a registrant, other than an investment company, is a \u201csmall\nbusiness\u201d or \u201csmall organization\u201d if it had total assets of $5 million or less on the last day of its\nmost recent fiscal year and is engaged or proposing to engage in an offering of securities that\ndoes not exceed $5 million.3237 An investment company, including a business development\ncompany,3238 is considered to be a \u201csmall business\u201d if it, together with other investment\ncompanies in the same group of related investment companies, has net assets of $50 million or\nless as of the end of its most recent fiscal year.3239 We estimate that, as of December 31, 2022,\nthere were approximately 800 issuers and 10 business development companies that may be\nconsidered small entities that would be subject to the final amendments.\n3236 5 U.S.C. 601(6).\n3237 See 17 CFR 240.0-10(a).\n3238 Business development companies are a category of closed-end investment company that are not registered\nunder the Investment Company Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(48) and 80a-53 through 64].\n3239 17 CFR 270.0-10(a).\n837\n\nD. Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and other Compliance Requirements\nAs noted above, requirements to disclose material GHG emissions information and obtain\nassurance over that information will not apply to SRCs, EGCs, or NAFs in response to concerns\nraised by commenters. For the remainder of the requirements, we continue to expect that the\nnature of any benefits and costs associated with the amendments to be similar for large and small\nentities, and so we refer to the discussion of the amendments\u2019 economic effects on all affected\nparties, including small entities, in section IV above. Also consistent with the discussion in\nsections II and IV above, we acknowledge that, to the extent that a smaller entity would be\nrequired to provide disclosure under the final rules, it may face costs that are proportionally\ngreater as it may be less able to bear such costs relative to larger entities.3240 The costs of\npreparing the disclosure would be a primary contributing factor given that compliance with\ncertain provisions of the final amendments may require the use of professional skills, including\nlegal, accounting, and technical skills. We also anticipate that the economic benefits and costs\nlikely could vary widely among small entities based on a number of factors, such as the nature\nand conduct of their businesses, including whether and how they managed any material climate-\nrelated risks, which makes it difficult to project the economic impact on small entities with\nprecision. To the extent that the disclosure requirements have a greater effect on smaller\nregistrants relative to large registrants, they could result in adverse effects on competition.\n3240 We note that some commenters stated that SRCs may have proportionately lower expenses. See letter from\nAmer. for Fin. Reform, Sunrise Project et al.\n838\n\nE. Agency Action to Minimize Effect on Small Entities\nThe RFA directs us to consider alternatives that would accomplish our stated objectives,\nwhile minimizing any significant adverse impact on small entities. Accordingly, we considered\nthe following alternatives:\n1. Exempting small entities from all or part of the requirements;\n2. Establishing different compliance or reporting requirements that consider the resources\navailable to small entities;\n3. Using performance rather than design standards; and\n4. Clarifying, consolidating, or simplifying compliance and reporting requirements under\nthe rules for small entities.\nThe rules are intended to allow investors to make more informed investment and voting\ndecisions about the impact of climate-related risks on registrants\u2019 business and financial\ncondition. As explained in section I.A. above, current requirements are not yielding consistent\nand comparable disclosure sufficient to meet investors\u2019 needs. The disclosure that does exist is\nscattered in various parts of registrants\u2019 filings and public disclosures and provided at different\nintervals, making it difficult for investors to locate, analyze, and compare across registrants.\nGiven the current disclosure landscape, exempting small entities entirely from the rules\nor otherwise clarifying, consolidating, or simplifying compliance and reporting requirements\nunder the rules for small entities would frustrate the rulemaking\u2019s goal of providing investors\nwith more consistent, comparable and timely disclosure about climate-related risks across all\nregistrants. However, as discussed in section II above, we have consolidated and simplified the\ndisclosure requirements for all entities, which should ease small entities\u2019 compliance as well.\nFurther, as some commenters noted, smaller companies may face equal or greater climate-related\n839\n\nrisk than larger companies, making the disclosures important for investors in these\ncompanies.3241 However, we have determined to require the disclosure of Scope 1 and Scope 2\nGHG emissions only in certain circumstances from the largest filers, thereby excluding smaller\ncompanies from these provisions. We believe that this strikes an appropriate balance between\nthe needs of investors in smaller companies, including small entities, to understand the likely\nimpacts of material climate-related risks and the costs associated with compliance.\nWe also believe the rulemaking\u2019s stated objectives can be achieved by providing smaller\ncompanies with additional time to comply. Therefore, smaller companies, including small\nentities that are SRCs, EGCs and NAFs, will be provided with more than two years from the\neffective date of the final rules before compliance is required; specifically, these entities must\nbegin to comply in filings that are required to include financial information for fiscal year 2027.\nThese changes will benefit small entities and other small companies, both by giving them an\nextended compliance period to establish disclosure controls and procedures and by allowing\nthem to observe and learn from best practices as they develop among larger registrants.\nSimilarly, the final rules incorporate a combination of performance and design standards\nwith respect to all affected registrants, including small entities, in order to balance the objectives\nand compliance burdens of the final rules. While the final rules use design standards to promote\nuniform compliance requirements for all registrants and to address the disclosure concerns\nunderlying the amendments, which apply to entities of all sizes, they also incorporate elements of\nperformance standards to give registrants sufficient flexibility to craft meaningful disclosure that\nis tailored to their particular facts and circumstances. For example, the final rules require a\nregistrant to describe the actual and potential material impacts of any material climate-related\n3241 See supra note 3233.\n840"

(1) A registrant that is required to provide Scope 1 and/or Scope 2\nemissions disclosure pursuant to \u00a7 229.1505 must include an attestation report covering such\ndisclosure in the relevant filing, subject to the following provisions:\n(i) For filings made by an accelerated filer beginning the third fiscal year after the\ncompliance date for \u00a7 229.1505 and thereafter, the attestation engagement must, at a minimum,\nbe at a limited assurance level and cover the registrant\u2019s Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions\ndisclosure;\n860\n\n(ii) For filings made by a large accelerated filer beginning the third fiscal year after the\ncompliance date for \u00a7 229.1505, the attestation engagement must, at a minimum, be at a limited\nassurance level and cover the registrant\u2019s Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions disclosure; and\n(iii) For filings made by a large accelerated filer beginning the seventh fiscal year after\nthe compliance date for \u00a7 229.1505 and thereafter, the attestation engagement must be at a\nreasonable assurance level and cover the registrant\u2019s Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions\ndisclosure.\n(2) Any attestation report required under this section must be provided pursuant to\nstandards that are:\n(i) Publicly available at no cost or that are widely used for GHG emissions assurance; and\n(ii) Established by a body or group that has followed due process procedures, including\nthe broad distribution of the framework for public comment.\n(3) A registrant that is required to provide Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions disclosure\npursuant to \u00a7 229.1505 that obtains voluntary assurance over its GHG emissions disclosure prior\nto the first required fiscal year for assurance must comply with paragraph (e) of this section.\nVoluntary assurance obtained by such registrant after the first required fiscal year that is in\naddition to any required assurance must follow the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (d) of\nthis section and must use the same attestation standard as the required assurance over Scope 1\nand/or Scope 2 emissions disclosure.\n(b) GHG emissions attestation provider. The GHG emissions attestation report required\nby paragraph (a) of this section must be prepared and signed by a GHG emissions attestation\nprovider. A GHG emissions attestation provider means a person or a firm that has all of the\nfollowing characteristics:\n861\n\n(1) Is an expert in GHG emissions by virtue of having significant experience in\nmeasuring, analyzing, reporting, or attesting to GHG emissions. Significant experience means\nhaving sufficient competence and capabilities necessary to:\n(i) Perform engagements in accordance with attestation standards and applicable legal\nand regulatory requirements; and\n(ii) Enable the service provider to issue reports that are appropriate under the\ncircumstances.\n(2) Is independent with respect to the registrant, and any of its affiliates, for whom it is\nproviding the attestation report, during the attestation and professional engagement period.\n(i) A GHG emissions attestation provider is not independent if such attestation provider is\nnot, or a reasonable investor with knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would\nconclude that such attestation provider is not, capable of exercising objective and impartial\njudgment on all issues encompassed within the attestation provider\u2019s engagement.\n(ii) In determining whether a GHG emissions attestation provider is independent, the\nCommission will consider:\n(A) Whether a relationship or the provision of a service creates a mutual or conflicting\ninterest between the attestation provider and the registrant (or any of its affiliates), places the\nattestation provider in the position of attesting to such attestation provider\u2019s own work, results in\nthe attestation provider acting as management or an employee of the registrant (or any of its\naffiliates), or places the attestation provider in a position of being an advocate for the registrant\n(or any of its affiliates); and\n862\n\n(B) All relevant circumstances, including all financial or other relationships between the\nattestation provider and the registrant (or any of its affiliates), and not just those relating to\nreports filed with the Commission.\n(iii) The term \u201caffiliate\u201d as used in this section has the meaning provided in \u00a7210.2-01 of\nthis chapter, except that references to \u201caudit\u201d are deemed to be references to the attestation\nservices provided pursuant to this section.\n(iv) The term \u201cattestation and professional engagement period\u201d as used in this section\nmeans both:\n(A) The period covered by the attestation report; and\n(B) The period of the engagement to attest to the registrant\u2019s GHG emissions or to\nprepare a report filed with the Commission (\u201cthe professional engagement period\u201d). The\nprofessional engagement period begins when the GHG attestation service provider either signs\nan initial engagement letter (or other agreement to attest toa registrant\u2019s GHG emissions) or\nbegins attest procedures, whichever is earlier.\n(c) Attestation report requirements. The form and content of the attestation report must\nfollow the requirements set forth by the attestation standard (or standards) used by the GHG\nemissions attestation provider.\n(d) Additional disclosure by the registrant. In addition to including the GHG emissions\nattestation report required by paragraph (a) of this section, a large accelerated filer and an\naccelerated filer must disclose, alongside the GHG emissions disclosure to which the attestation\nreport relates, after requesting relevant information from any GHG emissions attestation provider\nas necessary:\n863\n\n(1) Whether the GHG emissions attestation provider is subject to any oversight inspection\nprogram, and if so, which program (or programs), and whether the GHG emissions attestation\nengagement is included within the scope of authority of such oversight inspection program.\n(2)(i) Whether any GHG emissions attestation provider that was previously engaged to\nprovide attestation over the registrant\u2019s GHG emissions disclosure pursuant to paragraph (a) of\nthis section for the fiscal year period covered by the attestation report resigned (or indicated that\nit declined to stand for re-appointment after the completion of the attestation engagement) or was\ndismissed. If so,\n(A) State whether the former GHG emissions attestation provider resigned, declined to\nstand for re-appointment, or was dismissed and the date thereof; and\n(B) State whether during the performance of the attestation engagement for the fiscal year\nperiod covered by the attestation report there were any disagreements with the former GHG\nemissions attestation provider on any matter of measurement or disclosure of GHG emissions or\nattestation scope of procedures. Also,\n(1) Describe each such disagreement; and\n(2) State whether the registrant has authorized the former GHG emissions attestation\nprovider to respond fully to the inquiries of the successor GHG emissions attestation provider\nconcerning the subject matter of each such disagreement.\n(ii) The term \u201cdisagreements\u201d as used in this section shall be interpreted broadly, to\ninclude any difference of opinion concerning any matter of measurement or disclosure of GHG\nemissions or attestation scope or procedures that (if not resolved to the satisfaction of the former\nGHG emissions attestation provider) would have caused it to make reference to the subject\nmatter of the disagreement in connection with its report. It is not necessary for there to have\n864\n\nbeen an argument to have had a disagreement, merely a difference of opinion. For purposes of\nthis section, however, the term disagreements does not include initial differences of opinion\nbased on incomplete facts or preliminary information that were later resolved to the former GHG\nemissions attestation provider\u2019s satisfaction by, and providing the registrant and the GHG\nemissions attestation provider do not continue to have a difference of opinion upon, obtaining\nadditional relevant facts or information. The disagreements required to be reported in response\nto this section include both those resolved to the former GHG emissions attestation provider\u2019s\nsatisfaction and those not resolved to the former provider\u2019s satisfaction. Disagreements\ncontemplated by this section are those that occur at the decision-making level, i.e., between\npersonnel of the registrant responsible for presentation of its GHG emissions disclosure and\npersonnel of the GHG emissions attestation provider responsible for rendering its report.\n(iii) In determining whether any disagreement has occurred, an oral communication from\nthe engagement partner or another person responsible for rendering the GHG emissions\nattestation provider\u2019s opinion or conclusion (or their designee) will generally suffice as a\nstatement of a disagreement at the \u201cdecision-making level\u201d within the GHG emissions attestation\nprovider and require disclosure under this section.\n(e) Disclosure of voluntary assurance. A registrant that is not required to include a GHG\nemissions attestation report pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section must disclose in the filing\nthe following information if the registrant\u2019s GHG emissions disclosure in the filing were subject\nto third-party assurance:\n(1) Identification of the service provider of such assurance;\n(2) Description of the assurance standard used;\n(3) Description of the level and scope of assurance services provided;\n865\n\n(4) Brief description of the results of the assurance services;\n(5) Whether the service provider has any material business relationships with or has\nprovided any material professional services to the registrant; and\n(6) Whether the service provider is subject to any oversight inspection program, and if so,\nwhich program (or programs) and whether the assurance services over GHG emissions are\nincluded within the scope of authority of such oversight inspection program.\n(f) Location of Disclosure. A registrant must include the attestation report and disclosure\nrequired by this section in the filing that contains the GHG emissions disclosure to which the\nreport and disclosure relate. If, in accordance with the requirements in \u00a7 229.1505, a registrant\nelects to incorporate by reference its GHG emissions disclosure from its Form 10-Q (\u00a7 249.308a\nof this chapter) for the second fiscal quarter in the fiscal year immediately following the year to\nwhich the GHG emissions disclosure relates or to provide this information in an amended annual\nreport on Form 10-K (\u00a7 249.310 of this chapter) or 20-F (\u00a7 249.220f of this chapter), then the\nregistrant must include an express statement in its annual report indicating its intention to\nincorporate by reference the attestation report from either a quarterly report on Form 10-Q or\namend its annual report on Form 10-K or Form 20-F to provide the attestation report by the due\ndate specified in \u00a7 229.1505.\nInstruction 1 to Item 1506: A registrant that obtains assurance from an attestation\nprovider at the limited assurance level should refer to \u00a7 229.601(b)(27) and paragraph 18 of\nForm 20-F\u2019s Instructions as to Exhibits.\n\u00a7 229.1507 (Item 1507) Safe harbor for certain climate-related disclosures\n(a)(1) The safe harbors for forward-looking statements in section 27A of the Securities\nAct of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77z-2) and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15\n866\n\nU.S.C. 78u-5) (\u201cstatutory safe harbors\u201d) apply as provided in this section to information provided\npursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 229.1502(e), 229.1502(f), 229.1502(g), and 229.1504.\n(2) The safe harbor provided by this section applies to a forward-looking statement\nspecified in the statutory safe harbors:\n(i) Made in connection with an offering of securities by a blank check company, as\nspecified in 15 U.S.C 77z-2(b)(1)(B) and 15 U.S.C. 78u-5(b)(1)(B);\n(ii) Made with respect to the business or operations of an issuer of penny stock, as\nspecified in 15 U.S.C 77z-2(b)(1)(C) and 15 U.S.C. 78u-5(b)(1)(C);\n(iii) Made in connection with a rollup transaction, as specified in 15 U.S.C 77z-\n2(b)(1)(D) and 15 U.S.C. 78u-5(b)(1)(D);\n(iv) Made in connection with an initial public offering, as specified in 15 U.S.C 77z-\n2(b)(2)(D) and 15 U.S.C. 78u-5(b)(2)(D); and\n(v) Made in connection with an offering by, or relating to the operations of, a partnership,\nlimited liability company, or a direct participation investment program, as specified in 15 U.S.C\n77z-2(b)(2)(E) and 15 U.S.C. 78u-5(b)(2)(E).\n(3) Notwithstanding 15 U.S.C. 77z-2(a)(1) and 15 U.S.C. 78-u(a)(1), the safe harbor\nprovided by this section will apply where an issuer that, at the time that the statement is made, is\nnot subject to the reporting requirements of section 13(a) or section 15(d) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934.\n(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, all information required by\n\u00a7\u00a7 229.1502(e), 229.1502(f), 229.1502(g), and 229.1504 is considered a forward-looking\nstatement for purposes of the statutory safe harbors, except for historical facts, including, as non-\nexclusive examples, terms related to carbon offsets or RECs described pursuant to \u00a7 229.1504\n867\n\nand statements in response to \u00a7\u00a7 229.1502(e) or 229.1504 about material expenditures actually\nincurred.\n\u00a7 229.1508 (Item 1508) Interactive data requirement.\nProvide the disclosure required by this subpart 1500 in an Interactive Data File as\nrequired by \u00a7 232.405 of this chapter (Rule 405 of Regulation S-T) in accordance with the\nEDGAR Filer Manual (see \u00a7 232.301 of this chapter).\nPART 230\u2013-GENERAL RULES AND REGULATIONS, SECURITIES ACT OF 1933\n7.
